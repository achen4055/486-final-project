    " A Promised Land": "book reviews: Our expectations for elected officials aren t always very realistic, and none more than for those elected to the highest office in our country. We ve never had a perfect President and never will, but there are certain qualities that I believe are essential. Intelligence, a respect for the office and more importantly a reverence for our democracy, a strong sense of responsibility for protecting our nation and its citizens, leadership skills that bring together qualified people in the government, a recognition that we have a role to play as citizens of the world, to name a few. Former President Barack Obama was not a perfect President, but I believe that he embodied all of these things that I expect in a President and I believe that even more now, after listening to this book.  No matter what you think about Barack Obama, the man can write! It s illustrated in this first volume of his memoir, as well as the other books he s written. There are beautiful descriptions of walking along the promenade from the White House residence to the West Wing, the Rose Garden, the Oval Office, intimate descriptions of his family life, his love for his wife and daughters, his love for his deceased mother and grandparents. My favorite introspective passage is the following quote which I played over and over to be sure I got the words right, but also because they represent in such a meaningful way how he viewed his enormous responsibility.   I would never fully rid myself of the sense of reverence I felt when ever I walked Into the Oval Office, the feeling that I entered not an office, but a sanctum of democracy. Day after day it like comforted and fortified me reminding me of the privilege of my burdens and my duties.    My favorite parts of the book were early on when he talked about making the decision to run and the stories of the campaign were just so fascinating, funny at times and so informative. Michelle asked him just before he announced that he would run ,  Why you?  Obama responded that if he became President,  the world would look at America differently, that kids , Black and Hispanic or kids who don t fit in will see themselves differently, their horizons lifted, their possibilities expanded .  I enjoyed so much hearing about the grass roots campaign, using the internet, how the field organizers in Iowa worked was just fascinating. With love and respect, he tells of his relationships with David Axelrod, Robert Gibbs, the young Reggie Love and David Pfluffe, who Obama thought was so brilliant that he became his Campaign Manager and so many others. I loved hearing the origins of  Fired up ! Ready to Go !   Always prepared, he wrote both a concession and acceptance speech.   The book is also laden with dense discussions on the economic crisis the country was facing when he took office, his first G20 conference, foreign policy, health care and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the war in Afghanistan. I have to admit that there were some chapters where I sped up the audio, but for anyone who is a policy wonk, these might be more interesting. These chapters, though, reflect the complexity of the issues before him and the country at this time. They also reflect the intelligent, pragmatic yet caring ways he approached things.  Barack Obama always felt the weight of the office and the responsibility to protect the nation, the huge responsibility of being Commander in Chief, the casualties of troops in Afghanistan, writing letters to their families. He read security briefings every morning, and then had meetings with security staff right after - imagine that ! (Couldn t help myself.) This narrative reflects part of his first term and I can t wait for the second volume. I love this man . I cried when he won in 2008, a good, heartfelt cry and I cried when his second term was over, a sad and horrified cry. ( Again , I couldn t help myself.) I have missed him every single day since January 20, 2017. Clearly, I m biased so you might want to read it yourself, and I do highly recommend it .  1 book reviews: I am  areading' this via audiobook because even though it 's 29 hours long, just listening to Obama 's steady voice is reassuring during this current insanity (November 2020).  (Also, this ended up being my 100th book I have read this year, officially meeting my reading goal!)  I am not sure what I enjoyed most about this book. Was it the insight into how Obama got into politics and then decided to run for President? Was it the look into his primary run against Hillary Clinton? Was it his eventual win against John McCain and his crazy VP pick Sarah Palin? Was it the behind the scenes look into some of his biggest pieces of legislation, namely Obamacare? Or was it his REAL thoughts on certain events that happened during his first 4 years of his Presidency?  Honestly, it 's all the above, but that last one had me cackling with sarcastic cynical laughter, when Obama details what he really wanted to say during a certain press conference.  Go pick up this audiobook. Go listen to what a real President should sound like - basically a reasonable, intelligent human being. And then mourn those good ole' days as we finish this hellscape of the last 4 years. Oh and did I also mention that there 's an unfortunate reveal about Biden 's judgment in the very last chapter? *sigh*  Thanks, Obama. (meant sincerely)  2 book reviews: The $45 cover price is only steep if you don t consider the implied number humor 3 book reviews: One thing I want to mention. This is Goodreads.

Thanks  4 book reviews: This book was so incredible and it gave me so much hope for America. I miss Obama so much, he 's so well-spoken and he has such a way with words, I listened to the audiobook which is definitely the way to go for this book. This is one of the only political books I have ever read, but it was absolutely captivating to hear about all the experiences he went through as President and all the tough decisions he had to make. I love that throughout it he sprinkles in his stories of his family and I loved hearing about Michelle and the girls, their family is the cutest.  It brought tears to my eyes reliving him being the first Black man elected President of the United States, it was so beautiful to hear about it from his POV. I was in 8th grade when Obama got elected President and I really wish I would have understood the significance of that then. I never got super involved in politics until I was in college, but wow what a historical moment in time.  . He 's so jarringly different from the President we currently have (Trump) that it 's kind of heart breaking to think how much things have changed in the last four years. I miss Obama 's laid back attitude and positivity so much. This book really inspired me so much, just the way he talks is so motivating and empowering.  Obama is a reminder to me and to everyone that your dreams can be achieved, and he really is a symbol of hope for this country. I ca not wait to read the second book whenever it eventually comes out.  That 's all I have to say, I am just going to leave you with this quote that really moved me and gave me so much hope for America:  5 book reviews: Summary This book tells us the journey of a young man who was a student in Hawaii to Harvard University and then ultimately to the White House. This is the first volume of his autobiography and ends in May 2011, describing Operation Neptune spear. It gives us hope in a democracy when he divulges empathy as one of the most critical pillars on which democracy is built.  According to Obama,      Obama s childhood was arduous due to absence of his father. He also had to face quandaries related to race like everyone else growing at that time.         When Obama joined Columbia University after sophomore year, he only reading, writing, filling up journals, rarely bothering with college parties, or even eating good food. Obama in this book is saying that this is the period he wants to amend in his life if he ever could zip back in time     Obama is mentioning that during the JJ Dinner, he was convinced that he could win Iowa. Obama s victory in Iowa helped him establish as one of the Democratic frontrunners of 2008. His journey to that victory was not perfect; in fact, it had lots of drawbacks. This clearly shows that we can win even if we are not the best candidate. Obama says in this book that     When someone asked Obama why so many working-class people in Pennsylvania continued to vote for Republican s Obama gave a reply which he considers as his biggest mistake during his campaign. He told,     Obama s debate-day routine was a riveting one, and every one of us can try to emulate in our own style when we are facing stressful situations like Obama.               Mahatma Gandhi was one of Obama s role models. He mentions how Mahatma Gandhi influence him    Operation Neptune Spear was a precision strike operation executed by the United States Navy seals that eliminated Osama Bin Laden undercover in Abbottabad. It was one of the most important events that happened during Obama s first term. He had a different view regarding this operation compared to many others.     Even though there are many layers for this biography, the best part of this book will be when he mentions his love for his family. It is easy to get carried away when you have a high profile job requiring an intense amount of time and dedication. But, Obama was very particular about the family time in his schedule, and he dedicated some time for the family every day. He thoroughly enjoyed the quality time he spent with them. He was also fortunate to have a very understanding wife and children. He was also ready to sacrifice anything for the wellness of the family. We can see it in the passage where he is talking about his smoking habit.          1) of an individual 2) How his grandparents and parents helped him to become a mentally strong person? 3) How Obama s actions helped in ? 4) How are trying to control American Politics? 5) Obamacare- pros and cons. 6) Obamas response when he won the Nobel peace prize 7) How Obama dealt with the BP oil spill (which is considered as the worst oil spill in U.S. history)? 8) How Obama from a likely depression? 9) How Obama stabilized the global financial system and yanked the U.S. auto industry back from the brink of collapse? 10) How tens of billions of dollars that had once gone into bank coffers were used in reforming student loan programs and to make investments in clean energy? 11) His measures to 12) His measures to tackle the Middle East crisis   1) This is a 751 page book and this is just the first volume.   Obama is one of the few individuals that the world has seen who totally respects his opponents. We can see his respect for those opposing him in multiple parts of this book. But there is one portion in this book where he lambasted his opponents harshly.    There are indeed certain leaders in the modern Republican Party with the above demerits. But, I still feel it was a little harsh to generalize it over the whole modern Republican Party, especially from Obama, who almost always respected his opponents.  . This is the portion of this book that caused a whole lot of in many countries. I also felt that some parts of it should have been edited out.        I can point out at least five more instances where he was very harsh in commenting about world leaders and their countries. Obama was indeed trying to write honest opinions from his heart without any filters. But it is still sad to see a man of Obama s stature writing against leaders of other countries in such a manner that too based on rumors (like the case of Lula Da De Silva) and generalizing as a whole about a country based on very few factors.  Compared to the overall scope of this book and the knowledge it provides, these minor negatives are negligible.          It might be one of the bulkiest biographies I came across with. But it is also one of the best autobiographies or memoirs I ever read. There is no surprise that it gathered a huge number of votes in just a few days after it was released to win the best memoir and autobiography award in Goodreads.   6 book reviews: If you think I would not add this after Michelle Obama 's Becoming, are we even friends? 7 book reviews: Yes! When I see the winner announcement, I got more and more excited to get this amazing journey into my hands! I am so thankful to Mimi Chan and fantastic Goodreads team for sending this remarkable novel 's copy to me! I am already hooked! This is one of the most precious gift I have ever gotten for a long time! 8 book reviews:  Whatever you do won t be enough,  I heard their voices say.  Try anyway.   Obama had just been drubbed in an election against a popular candidate when he made the absolutely crazy decision to run for the US Senate. Michelle thought he was out of his mind. He was talking about  magic beans  and shit, but he assured her that this was it. If he lost, he was done with politics. Their credit cards were maxed out, and their overall financial picture was dire...let s just say, the Star Trek klaxon bells were sounding, and Scotty was screaming at Kirk that he couldn t hold it together much longer.  Would he really have done with politics if he d lost? Hell no. I don t believe it, and as reassuring as the words probably sounded to Michelle, I seriously doubt she believed it either. He had a fire in his belly, and that candle was burning hot. He had a dream, and he wasn t going to hide it under a bushel. Unh uh!  So in March of 2004, he won the senate election, and in July he was tapped by John Kerry to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. I can remember looking over at my wife and going...who is this guy? I m a pretty savvy political person. I can remember watching LBJ s funeral when I was six. I was nine and can remember feeling sorry for President Gerald Ford, even though I had supported President Jimmy Carter in the 1976 Presidential election. Let s just say that I tuned into United States politics...early on. So I was thinking...this guy...for the keynote?    I love this conversation he had in the White House with his team, but it sort of sums up the dream-like quality of his rise to the presidency. Spoiler alert...he wins the presidency in 2008.              *Phil Schiliro may have watched too many Dirty Harry movies.  I admit, when the Kansas caucus came around, I was sitting in a small room of people supporting Hillary Clinton. I thought Obama was running a cycle early. It was time to elect our first female president, and who knew how long it would be before another woman with the name recognition of Clinton would emerge from the process? I was flabbergasted at the number of people, mostly younger people! who caucused in the gym for Barack Obama. I kept thinking to myself, If these people would actually vote, we could turn Ford County blue. To give you an idea of how red the county is that I live in, 41% of Kansans voted for Joseph R. Biden, but Ford County came in at 33%. In Phillips County, where I grew up, only 11% voted for Biden. Needless to say, my extended family are not only Republicans but are unabashed Trumpsters. I am the black sheep of the family, or should I say the blue sheep of the family.  Obama ran a terrific, revolutionary, grass roots campaign and, against all odds, won the primary and electrified a nation in the process.  So this book primarily covers the election campaign and his first term in office. The second book will cover his second presidential campaign and term in office. Normally, I wouldn t read this book this soon. I ordinarily like history to get smaller in my rearview mirror before I read any books about it, but after a bruising four years of Trump and an election campaign that slenderized my Facebook friends, mostly family, list, I decided that I needed some time with a voice of reason. I needed to experience our future by reading about the past because I do feel that Obama was the future, even when he was our president of the present.  I like the way he was self-deprecating about his mistakes. Even Obama made some gaffes while speaking...remember  cling to guns or religion?  Stating the stark truth isn t always the best strategy. I love this little scene with David Axelrod while prepping for a debate.            Okay, we were all distracted by the fly that flew into Vice-President Mike Pence s hair and died from toxic embalming fluid during the debate with Vice-President Kamala Harris...I can say that now! Yeah!...but I have never seen a politician during a debate completely ignore any of the questions he was asked like he did. It was hilarious.  If you have been pining for the days when Obama was your president, you will absolutely love reliving those sometimes rocky roads as Obama tried to change our world for the better, despite the best efforts of the Republicans to block anything he tried to do. The Republicans made it very clear from the beginning that they were going to put the party first over the country. The Obama years, despite the obstructions, were certainly halcyon days compared to the last four years. The behind-the-scenes stuff that he shares made me respect and like him even more. He is genuine and cares about the same things that all of us care about, our family, our friends, our dogs, and our need for a sustainable future. He has some of the same fallacies and self-doubts that the rest of us have, but he was determined to become someone who could make a difference.    Let s hope President Joseph Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, after getting the White House fumigated and clearing away all the McDonald s hamburger wrappers, can start driving the car in the right direction.    President Obama also answered my question on GR.

Goodness, this was long; long but not at all boring. I listened to the audiobook, which Obama reads himself, and there was a sort of comfort in hearing his voice (for 30 hours ). Whatever you want to say about him, and he seems quite willing to admit his mistakes, Obama is an example of a truly decent man, such a vast contrast to the one currently occupying the White House. I wo not go into details of the content of the book, but while I expected to find that nothing much would come as new information, I finished it feeling I have a much deeper insight into Obama 's first term as well as the life and responsibilities of a president. If Trump could read, I would suggest he start here. He might learn something.

In it, he details his political rise, the 2008 campaign for president, and what his administration accomplished in their first 2.5 years in office. Filled with his characteristic intelligence and thoughtfulness, it vividly portrays all that his administration has accomplished and the ways they fell short. It also calls attention to how fragile our democracy is and how easily it can be derailed.  Clocking in at more than 700 pages, this was a real doozy of a tome. And it 's only the first volume! But reading it, it did not feel overly long because of the sheer amount of content covered. It 's actually quite concise on each topic and is balanced by the fact that the Obama administration accomplished a lot, even during just the initial 2.5 years of his presidency covered in this book. Obama is a terrific writer, succinctly hitting upon all the highlights and lowlights of his journey so far.  (As an aside, I started out reading the hardcover version of this book, which has beautiful pictures, but it 's super heavy. I could not get comfortable with it in my hands, so I quickly switched over to the eBook, which I stuck with for the remainder of the book. I have also heard that the audiobook is absolutely stellar, as it 's read by Obama himself. Just some quick thoughts, if you are trying to decide which medium to go with.)  Though my favorite parts of the memoir are the ones where Obama shares personal anecdotes about himself and his family (and their dog Bo!), or observations about what it 's like to be president, those were just a small part of this book. The major focus is on his policies and accomplishments throughout his political career and during his campaign for president.  Going in, I thought there would be some surprises in here, now that Obama is no longer president and can say what he really feels. But nothing in here surprised me. During his administration, I followed current events pretty closely, so everything he talks about (the financial crisis, bailout of banks and auto industry, healthcare reform, climate treaty, Frank-Dodd, the middle east, Israeli Palestinian conflict, Arab Springs, repeal of DADT, raid on bin Laden, etc.) are all events I already know pretty thoroughly.  Even though there were no surprises, Obama is still a skilled writer. He 's great at explaining and summarizing fairly complex ideas in a few short paragraphs. It 's also enlightening to see his take of the events that transpired under him and his process in coming to the decisions that he ultimately made.  During his presidency, Obama elevated discourse and gave us the hope of not just a better America, but a better democracy, one that could be free from injustice, inequality, and partisan deadlock. To read his memoir is like reliving the history of this nation during its heyday, when it felt like we were on a trajectory of limitless possibility and progress.  Still, I would not say this has been an easy read. It was actually hard and frustrating to read about all the obstructions and malice that he, his administration, and his family faced. And considering what happened once he left office (and is still happening), reading it triggered a fair bit of anxiety in me. But it 's a vital part of history, and knowing it helps me form a more comprehensive understanding of our nation.  11 book reviews: Let me first tell you about me: I was an Obama diehard and an Obama apologist. I was hooked when I read Dreams of My Father and watched the 2004 speech. I was one of those people knocking doors in PA and other swing states during the 08 primary. I was elated when he won the primary and the night he won the national probably ranks as the happiest night of my life.  During the presidency, there were MANY things I did not like about the Obama administration--most of them had to do with the Geithner treasury and their handling of the crisis. But I have been an Obama apologist on that (they inherited the crisis, it was Summers' fault, Obama spent his energies elsewhere, etc etc).  So I have been waiting for this book for a long long time. I have been waiting to hear from Obama himself about what happened. And I have been completely willing to give him the benefit of all my doubts if he could give us his point of view.  And now, I am getting off the Obama train. I still love him and his family. I still think that every other GOP candidate would have been an absolute disaster for the country. But I am no longer defending Obama.  In this book, Obama shows the downside and the weakness inherent in being the most self-reflective person in the universe. He takes every important decision (troops in Iraq, homeownership crisis, gitmo, healthcare) and On the one hand-on the other hand 's it to DEATH! And then he basically says at the end of the day, the choice that Summers or Geithner or Gates told me I had was the only choice and so I did it and I would do it again. UGH. He did not fight! He did not push back. He just went along with the status quo as presented to it. That actually would have been fine (again, I am an Obama diehard), but at least have the awareness and humility to say \"Hey, I regret that the only people giving me options on what to do with homeowners were Geithner and Summers. Maybe Warren should have been in the room.\" Something like that.... Instead, he calls Warren a grand-stander and just defends his decisions.  Maybe you have to do that if you are an ex-president, but if you are going to write a 600 page memoir chock full of self-reflection, go a little bit further and throw us diehards a bone.  12 book reviews: Wow  Just wow! Is this one of the best books written out there? No, it certainly isn t. Obama says himself in the prologue that a better author would probably do a better job at cutting down this story   a story that seemed to keep on growing as he was writing. And this autobiography certainly has its share of long sentences (I counted 10 lines in one!) and extensive digressions (however fascinating). I certainly stared at the book with big eyes when I received it in the mail and realized that it s 800+ pages (the Danish version) and big enough to hit down a thief in the night   and then I realized that this is only PART ONE!? I had my apprehensions, but then I started reading the prologue, and from that moment I was engrossed. What this is is a unique insight into one of the world s most interesting jobs (in my opinion). Not everyone can write this book, and I was   and still am   furthermore a big fan of Obama and his views, personality, person. I knew I wanted to read this even though I ve already read Obama s two previous autobiographies AS WELL AS Michelle s autobiography (I was a big fan of that one as well!). Now that I ve read  A Promised Land , I can say that this one made for a whole different reading experience, and it gave me a whole other insight into Obama the person. I loved this book because it s been a long while since I was last this inspired by one man and his actions. Obama s calm reflections and views on how to grabble even the most horrifying incidents was truly an inspiration to me, and I found myself thinking about him and his book when I was not reading it   when I was dealing with things in my own life. One chapter took another. Had you asked me a month ago, I would ve thought this would be an enjoyable, but also somewhat dry read that I would at time drag myself through to get to the interesting parts. But no, having just turned the last page I find myself LONGING for the next (and final!) installment. It can only be published too late, in my opinion. I ll leave it at this and hope that I ve inspired some of you to pick up this monster of a book if you have somewhat of an interest in reading it, but   like me   have your apprehensions about it. Read it! You won t regret it! (And if you do, don t blame me) :-)  13 book reviews: Review posted on: https://books-are-a-girls-best-friend...  What makes a Great Leader?  When I ask myself that question, the characteristics I look for (to name a few) are Compassion, Dedication, Hard Work, Honesty, Integrity, Intellect, Manners, Mastery, Responsibility, and Reverence.    Though I thought I knew a lot about him prior to both reading and listening to  A Promised Land,  I learned so much more as I delved into his memoir.  I switched between physically reading the book and listening to the audiobook, to mainly listening because I found President Obama s voice to be extremely soothing. I could listen to him speak for hours (and in fact I did, considering that the audiobook is 29 hours!).  First and foremost, I was impressed by how kind and considerate President Obama was and is. Always recalling the names of campaign staffers and their families as well as the entire White House staff. Always checking in to make sure that everyone was hanging in. Responding to letters from the American People who had questions and concerns and trying to allay their fears whenever possible.    Barack Obama s relationships with his team (which included Axe, Plouffe, Reggie, and Ben, etc.) spoke volumes. What was evident here was the amount of admiration, appreciation, and respect everyone had for each other.  What struck me as I was reading and listening was how hard he worked to get where he is. Reading, studying, gaining advice from aides, scholars, and government officials, even going so far as to reach across party lines to ensure that he was doing the best job he possibly could for the Nation.    I was truly impressed by the attention to detail given by Barack Obama in  A Promised Land  and how he was able to recall key events and quotes from years prior with such accuracy.  Based on his descriptions of trying to get the Affordable Care Act passed, addressing the financial crisis, climate change (aka saving the tigers), and terrorism, there was nary a moment where I doubted how tirelessly President Obama worked during the first years of his Presidency to deliver as much as he possibly could.    Reading this brought me peace. Remembering the feeling of being sheltered in a storm, when someone had our best interests at heart, made me feel safe, if only for a minute. I miss that feeling immensely and I look forward with hope, to the days ahead.  Published on Goodreads on 12.14.20.  14 book reviews: Well that was... thorough.  At more than 750 pages, this is just volume one of Obama 's presidential memoirs. He takes readers behind the scenes from his childhood through the raid to kill Osama bin Laden. And then it just abruptly ends, leaving us to anticipate the next installment.  The parts I appreciated most were glimpses at his family life, particularly how he spent time with his wife and daughters in the White House. Those segments highlight cracks and vulnerabilities in his polished veneer, revealing the man behind the rhetoric.  On the whole, I view presidential memoirs as historical documents and try not to allow my political leanings to color my judgment on them. I considered omitting a star rating for this text, but ultimately I do believe 44 was successful in his goal of providing an honest accounting of his time in office. At least for the time he managed to cover in volume one. 4.5 stars.  15 book reviews: A Promised Land, Barack Obama  Barack Hussein Obama II is an American politician, academic, author, and attorney who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.  What a beautiful name they have chosen for his book. This is life, they have done an incredible job, and he won, this book is also, a memento for future peoples, to look at their ways, and his words, and read them, and hope, that they will always be victorious. The memoir, remaining focused on Obama 's political life, begins with his early life, details his first campaigns, and stretches through most of his first term as President.  The book concludes with the events surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, ending with a meeting between Obama and The United States Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) Teams, commonly known as Navy SEAL 's who conducted the raid. While the book remains focused on politics, the first 200 pages of the book, approximately, are devoted to Obama 's life and career up through his time in Chicago.           :                  :          :              2012    :        :      :          1399   798   9789640021590   :     --     --                      21     :      :      :      :    1399   818   9786008631262    :        :      :                          1399             9786227471335         9786227471403    :        :          ...[   ]             1399   833   9786227471410    :    :        :                1399           9786227267402    :      :      :          1399   1060   9786227585193            : (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         :                                                                                )        :      :      :                                                                                                                                                   :                                                                                                                                .          :                                                                                                                                                                                                           :                                                                                                                            .                        :                                                                            : (                                                                                                                                                               )                 : (           )         10/11/1399    13/01/1401     .    16 book reviews: \"Do we care to match the reality of America to its ideals? (...) I recognize that there are those who believe that it 's time to discard the myth - that an examination of America 's past and an even cursory glance at today 's headlines show that this nation 's ideals have always been secondary to conquest and subjugation, a racial caste system and rapacious capitalism, and that to pretend otherwise is to be complicit in a game that was rigged from the start. (...) I am not yet ready to abandon the possibility of America.\"  In the first part of his memoir, Obama gives a short account of how he paved the road to the White House and then proceeds to lay out his first term. People who mainly expect personal anecdotes about his family and motivational speeches will probably be disappointed, as the 44th President dives deep into policy and politics, talking about healthcare reform, Iraq, the intricacies of the financial crisis and many other issues.  Looking at the way he frames his (self-)portrayal, two things stand out: Obama identifies instances and tendencies that, from his perspective, lead to the rise of Trumpism, like Republican obstruction politics or the normalization of figures like Sarah Palin. Frequently, he is also very critical of himself (should his reform of the financial sector have been more thorough? did he handle the oil spill right? why did not he manage to close Guantanamo? etc.) and openly reflects his own anger and frustration over fast news cycles and spins, fellow politicians, and the paradoxical behavior of the American people (they want cheap oil, huge cars AND environmental protection, to name one example). This kind of openness and critical impetus is admirable - Obama does not try to gloss over all the things that did not go smoothly.  But needless to say, Obama tends to defend his decisions and standpoints - which is totally fine, he would not have acted the way he did in the first place if he was not convinced that he took the best measures possible at the time. Still, for a European like me, some arguments sound...well, weird. Obama 's way to downplay the American idea of exceptionalism while at the same time ventilating it (to a degree at least), his statement that the USA crafted the world order by implementing NATO, UNO, GATT (really? the US did that, single-handedly?! that will come as a surprise to many other countries) or the way he talks about the Dresden firestorm, an event that until today is instrumentalized by the far-right in East Germany, are a little questionable for a non-American. And I have to admit that it 's a little upsetting that such a beloved President still sometimes leans toward an imperial worldview that is, sorry America, outdated.  Still, Obama generally comes across as a humble, intelligent and morally upright person, a somewhat normal family man who fought hard to make the most of one of the most difficult jobs on the planet. He still stands for an idea of America that people all around the world want the US to live up to. Unsurprisingly, his writing is eloquent, easy to follow and captivating - this text shows why political non-fiction is exciting. I ca not wait to read pt. 2.  17 book reviews: First of all, how grateful am I that I get to read this after Donald Trump has been voted out of office? If I was worried about four more years of marching towards authoritarianism, I think reading Obama 's memoir would have made me more sad than anything else.  My early thoughts on this:  1. He is a fantastic writer. Yes, I know a lot of that is probably due to editors and assistants. The fact remains, though, that this is an incredibly well-written book.  2. He acknowledges that one of the biggest concerns that many had about his early runs for office was that he tended to be overly verbose and spent more time on policy detail than messaging. That 's definitely true of this book. He spends a lot of time discussing finer points of the 2008 financial crisis or even the history of Saudi Arabia that probably was not necessary for most readers but is also relatively skimmable. The downtick in the rating is largely due to this.  3. All of the qualities that I loved about Obama before shine through here: his thoughtfulness, his optimism, his compassion.  18 book reviews: Can somebody please go through the troll comments and remove the 1 star ratings of the person continuously posting the same, factually incorrect political statement - and any troll reviews for that matter.

It s ridiculous to call a book that s given this kind of funding even before it has been penned down as anything other than a corporate investment.  The author has given his opinion on other global/national leaders without having had any meaningful interaction with them. So I will offer a similar type of surface review of what I think about this author and his time in the White House, as it has been skipped by mainstream media during his term. Neither does his book examine any of the points below.  Black Lives Matter......yes, they definitely do matter. I wept when America voted the first black President as a moment of change for all black Americans. The author had 8 years in office, if that wasn t enough time to bring a drastic change in the lives of black Americans, this man is unfit for the job. He didn t do the needful or even the bare minimum for black people when he had the opportunity, otherwise there would be no need for BLM movement now.  Sanders had a healthcare plan that covered all Americans. An education plan to relieve students of debt. A climate plan that would have changed the American approach to the environment for the better. Yet Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. He is more comfortable encouraging other corporate stooges. He knows that Sanders in the White House for a single day would eclipse his 8 years of governance. Talk about letting personal insecurities obstructing what s right for the people!  Obama endorsing Clinton is cronyism. What was particularly empowering for women to vote for Hillary Clinton? If a husband cheats on his wife, it s perfectly fine for her to stay by his side. Many average women do it in reality. It takes a woman of spunk to have more self-respect, walk away from such a partnership and independently create an identity for herself. When a country such as America has a woman for President, hopefully she will be an exemplary woman that the rest of the world will take note. Someone who wants to stay with a cheating husband is better suited to embroider cushions at home (nothing wrong with that either), not to run the most powerful country. Set higher standards in choosing a President. Otherwise the outcome is obvious.  America slipped into recession in 2008. The author s wife was parading around the White House in designer clothes, that too customised, at a time when the average American was suffering from lower living standards and lack of decently-paid employment. There was much emphasis laid on Obama s middle class roots during campaigns, but no attempt to relate to the common American after getting the votes! Yet the next First Lady, who was actually a model before entering White House, maintained more decorum in office.  The author s daughter interned with Harry Weinstein, when she literally had every opportunity to intern in any organisation in the world. With her free-pass to prove her mettle by having access to any organisation in the world, she chose Harry Weinstein as her role model. So much for the author s upbringing and the values he passed on to his daughter!  The author is the reason why Americans were led to put Trump in the White House. I rest my case. And this man wants to comment on other leaders! He will go down in history as nothing other than the man who put Trump in the White House.  20 book reviews: Now a Goodreads Choice winner in Memoir/Autobiography!  I ve done a lot of complaining while reading A Promised Land, mostly because of the length. Despite having written two previous books, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, the third by our former president is already very long, sitting at a rotund 751 pages. So I was genuinely surprised when I found out this was only volume one of his presidential memoirs, covering primarily his first four year term in office. I went into this thinking, how can someone possibly write that many pages about such a compact period of time. I m 27, and if I wrote the amount Obama did for each year of my life I would have an over 5000-page memoir.  I guess part of my expectations there stem from the fact that I don t read political biographies & autobiographies for the most part. I think they are very boring and since most popular ones are accounts from the Civil War or World War II or other endlessly discussed periods of American history, I (probably wrongly, but whatever) feel like there really isn t much of a new or fresh take that I absolutely ** to read up on.  The other reason is because I read  s last year and it was one of the best memoirs I ve ever read. Michelle comes off as genuine and brilliant and warm and hilarious, and I loved her perspective on her and her family s time in the White House. She was also able to cover her entire life, from early childhood until current day, in a cool 426 pages, while her husband is likely to need at least 5 times that number. Barack mentions in the prologue that Michelle didn t read his book before he finished, which might be why nobody made any significant cuts.     But if I had read a few more presidential autobiographies I may have found resembles those more than Michelle s book for a very simple reason. This isn t a book just about Barack Obama s thoughts or feelings during his time as president, but is intended as a documentation of his official position as President of the United States. It s now an account of American history, a record of his decisions and time in office. Though it is written by the man himself and likely holds a lot of personal significance, its importance stretches beyond him individually as a citizen and instead is now a component of a larger institution.  So from that angle, I believe this book is enormously successful. I was a teenager when Obama took office in 2009 and though I do remember many of the events he described, I just wasn t aware of a lot of the broader tones and the implications of what these things meant. The level of obstruction from House and Senate Republicans in particular went completely over my head, as I m sure it did for a lot of the country, which is definitely intentional on their part. The ruthlessness of Mitch McConnell is nothing new over the past few years, and his crusades during this period are a major contributor towards many of the issues our country is facing today. So many things, by and large universally things, did not happen during the Obama years simply because McConnell threw himself in front of progress out of a compulsive need to prevent giving the first Black President of the United States even the mere of a  win .  Similarly, it makes me empathize with Obama s struggle to reconcile his ambitious, but still reasonable policy objectives with the realities of the political system he has to work within. I know personally I have fallen back on frustration with the Democratic establishment and how reluctant they seemed to be to  push harder  during the first term, especially the first two years, of his presidency. I think people further left on the spectrum have a right to that frustration, but directing it solely at Obama, who was also being attacked by a racist portion of the Tea Party and right-wing media, seems misplaced now. I don t agree or even approve of every action taken by his administration, but in a lot of cases it appears that, unfortunately, he did the best he could do with the hand he was dealt.  What I m hoping for in his next book, beyond more chronicling, is a push towards that more leftist contingent, instead of rooting himself in the center. It should have become obvious to most people in America by this point that the Republican party is really, on the whole, too far gone to try to appease any longer. It hasn t gotten us where we hoped it might, and they have been resolutely unwilling to reciprocate in any meaningful way. He may have had to play peacemaker while holding the highest office in the country, but he no longer carries that burden. I want President Obama to not just champion his old centrist friends like President-Elect Joe Biden, but make allies with the progressive wing of his party, think Representitives Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, Pressley & C. Bush.  The president has an opportunity to reach out those who feel uninspired and tired of being promised more then given the same. And like he did in 2008, I believe he still has the ability to speak to people on that level. The second volume is likely to end with a rallying cry, and the hope that I have is that he gives us more than platitudes and  snappy slogans .  21 book reviews: Loved seeing the former president yesterday in Amsterdam, what an inspiring speaker! A fascinating account of the rise of a president and the enormously diverse task facing him, told in an easy to read manner I realized that for all the power inherent in the seat I now occupied, there would always be a chasm between what I knew should be done to achieve a better world and what in a day, week, or year I found myself actually able to accomplish.  A very easily written and compelling account of the rise of to public office and the majority of his first term of president. Already you can see how much time has passed, the internet and digitisation almost do not come back (somewhat in his campaign, but a video with 1 million views is called viral) but topics of racial tension, #metoo and especially polarisation are already clearly present. Of the world leaders described by Obama only Merkel, Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden in a different capacity come back in our 2021 world.  I liked the first part of most, it was interesting to see the other side from , and Barack coming to terms with his ambitions and potential to make an impact (). It is striking how his earlier political career contains a virtuous cycle of attention and opportunity, leading him to be the only African American senator (which is wild). His community organizing is clearly influential in getting elected in the state legislature but his role as US senator gives him a change to really get involved in international affairs like al-shabaab and nuclear sites in the former USSR and earn credentials.  When he is elected the financial crisis takes up a lot of legislative effort, his personal story in respect to subprime loans is also interesting and a real case of storytelling, but I can imagine for people with less of financial background this might be of putting. In general this is much more a political story than her account of the same period, and the glances at the personal life of the Obama 's and his true feelings about the people he works with are scant versus the techniques being described to get anything done in gridlocked Washington. Also facts like a 1.000 extra troops in Afghanistan cost $1 billion a year makes you aware of the scale of the problems facing ambitions and campaign promises, as acknowledged by Obama:  Presidential power, and control of both houses, is relative with arcane firebreaks as the filibuster being abused for partisan goals. muses Obama in respect to the compromising required to get the Affordable Healthcare Act through, even though the Republicans earlier said:     or muse the following before the mid term elections:    Despite this Obama looks back quite positively to his managing the possible and avoiding calamities () which in a sense might be fair but also feels a little defensive compared to all the things I can imagine him wanting to achieve. This is partly acknowledged in the below:   Somehow I feel this book could have been more personal and vulnerable, despite how it made me think back quite longingly to a time the leadership of the US in the world seemed predominately a competent force for good in the world.          22 book reviews: This is the first volume of Barack Obama s presidential memoirs and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is an intimate look into his journey.. as a young man up until May 2011, when US Special Forces captured Osama bin Laden. This is a lengthy book but I so looked forward to my daily date with Barack.. I just had to listen to the audio! Cannot wait for the next volume! I love this man!  23 book reviews: this book was phenomenal to me. I found myself giggling, nodding with agreement, gasping with shock and crying throughout this book. In an alternate dimension, I truly believe Barack and I are best friends. I have always loved Obama 's writing, since I read Dreams of My Father in my teens, so of course I will be preordering his next book as soon as I can. 24 book reviews: It was so refreshing to hear a politician speak humbly, passionately, honestly and with dignity.  To be honest, I did not think it was possible for me to like this as much as I did Michelle Obama 's BECOMING, but I did.  The only fault I can find with this is that it 's a tad too long, but that did not take away from enjoyment in listening.  I look forward to reading his next book, and I look forward to seeing him more in the news as Joe Biden becomes our next president. (I am hoping that the Obamas will be part of our political life again. A girl can dream.)  My highest recommendation!  *I purchased this audiobook with my hard earned cash. It was worth every. single. penny.) *  25 book reviews: Just posted my Goodreads Choice 2020 Reaction Video on Booktube! Click the link to check it out!! YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads 26 book reviews: I m so ready for this!! 27 book reviews: A Promised Land by Barack Obama is the first of two books detailing the life and two terms of President Barack Obama, or Bar (pronounced  Bear') as his Mum and family called him. His childhood is detailed in the early chapters and is quite interesting to be sure. This includes his time being raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. The fact he came  from a family where the father was largely absent and he and his sister were raised by his Mum, would have had a profound effect on little Bar. He also touches on his relationship with Michelle , but in nowhere the same detail as Michelle mentioned in her 5 star effort .  The rest of the book is devoted to his political career from his early days in Chicago to most of his first term , up until the time Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011.  I had some real problems with this book and, I ll dot point them, otherwise I ll bang on all night (it s night time here):           He spent way, way, way too much time detailing the passage of various (admittedly) important Bills through Congress and the Senate.           As he did this Barack produced a limitless conga-line of politicians, and hangers on, only a political junkie would ever know, remember or care about.           The previous two points mean this book is really suited to domestic consumption (Hello World!).           Obama was very timid with his opinion of characters from the US   I assume the reader would really want to know what the man thought of some of these people (even the unknown ones)   in detail, I did. However he was a little more open about international politicians, but again not nearly enough.           This is essentially a transcript of political action, and personal details , thoughts and opinions took a back seat. Way too sterile for an autobiographical account.           I spent my entire time comparing this to Michelle 's book   Becoming, which was far more interesting and revealing on the personal front.           The fact this is the first part of two, isn t really obvious. Sure this fact is written on the inside sleeve cover. But I would have been mightily miffed if I had spent $45 on this one to realise I was only half-way to becoming utterly underwhelmed.  I do love this man and his politics, oratory skills, thinking, values and ethos immensely. But I don t really like this book, maybe my expectations were too high.  2.5 stars rounded up because I borrowed it.   28 book reviews: The true mettle of a person comes from the ability to overcome adversity and present themselves in as positive a light as possible, or at least I think so. With so much that has happened over the last four years in American politics, one might be able to extend that to the world s population, or at least those who spent any time impacted by the country in some way. When February began, I sought to spend some time looking at three men who had fought through the trenches of American politics and risen to the position of President of the United States. This memoir, the first of two parts, by President Barack Obama, serves as the final piece in this brief study. It was both refreshing and awe-inspiring, as well as whetted my appetite for the second part. While it is both laudatory and humbling, it does serve to prove that America fell into quite an abyss from 2017 until earlier this year, as we look back at the first term of a man who sought to change the rules and protect the country he loved while doing so. Some may disagree with this, which is their prerogative, though few can discount that the election of Barack Hussein Obama ushered in much change from the way things were done in Washington before. Gripping and enlightening, I was riveted with each page turn and cannot wait for the second volume to complete the story!  Born to modest means, Barack Obama was an outsider from the outset. With a Caucasian mother and Kenyan father whose relationship deteriorated early, Obama was never one to fit into any single group, which he mentions proved to be a yoke of his throughout those` ` formative years. Added to that, the boy who was born in Hawaii was soon travelling to Asia where he began his scholastic learning. He was passionate about education and did not allow himself to be shaped by the perception of others at any point.  When he finished public school in the United States, Obama had aspirations to make a difference, though he was also still in the mindset of many young people, wanting to balance fun with studying. He got passable grades and soon found himself before he landed in law school and found a passion he did not know was there. With the fire lit within him, Obama settled in Chicago and sought to make a difference in the lives of those around him as a community organiser, while also teaching at the law school. He met a lovely woman named Michelle Robinson, who changed his life and taught him the importance of being grounded. Obama speaks at length about their connection and quickly burgeoning relationship, which led to marriage, even if it was not always blissful.  As the Obamas laid down some roots and started a family, the enticement of politics soon crossed Barack s path. While not the life she pictured for herself, Michelle supported her husband as best she could for his run for a seat in Illinois  State Senate, a post he won. Balancing the workload with being a young father, Obama did his best to make a difference in the lives of many, while also trying to keep his narrative together. It was not always easy, but the Obamas made it work, somehow.  Testing the power of their relationship, Barack soon devised a plan to take his local advocacy onto a larger stage and sought to win a seat in the US Senate. Less than impressed and trying to carve out a career of her own, Michelle agreed to the venture, but set limits on campaigning and ensured that the Obama household would never have to come second to the electorate. Obama explores the run for a seat in DC and the struggles that he had to overcome, all while he was being noticed on the national stage. His invitation to speak at the 2004 Democratic National Convention proved to electrify a young Barack Obama, but also made a name for him amongst the heavy hitters in the party. He was a man whose name would cross their lips again soon.  The Obamas tried to get used to the national stage and life in DC, struggling at times with the dual households and added responsibilities. A newly-minted senator, Barack Obama had a great deal to learn, though received significant support on both sides of the aisle. Obama illustrates both the great help he received as well as struggles he was forced to overcome on such a large stage, all while trying to carve out his own niche. He sought to push for change, so much so that he would soon be a name people put forward for the 2008 presidential election, surprising because of his lack of experience.  As Obama explains, it was the idea of running for president that almost derailed his relationship. Michelle was wholeheartedly against it, having enough trouble keeping their girls away from the spotlight. It was a stressful time, as Barack wanted a larger taste of the limelight and knew he could make a difference. Backers and political heavyweights continued to press for him to run and Michelle did eventually agree, but set strict guidelines for any run. Thus began the monumental run for president by a man who would smash glass ceilings along the way.  Obama does not hold back about the 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination. It was a gloves-off affair, with a number of well-known heavy hitters, including: Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and John Edwards. They all had experience and name recognition on the national scene, though Obama had something that appealed to voters throughout the campaign. Keen on making himself known and advocating for what he believed was right, Obama was able to capture the nomination with some difficulty, as is described at length in one portion of the book.  The stage was set for a run against John McCain and the Republican base for the role of president. With the George W. Bush presidency entering its final year, the heat was on for both men to explain how they would bring America into a new era. No one could have predicted the issue that hid in the shadows, the massive financial crisis, though Obama explores it at length and how it shaped the campaign that summer and into the final stretch. Both Obama and McCain had their own way of handling it, walking a fine line as President Bush tried to wash his hands of it. Grit and determination balanced against pure vilification of the current administration s choices in the final weeks, while Obama and McCain locked horns. When all the ballots were counted, America had chosen its first African American president and change was on the horizon, the campaign slogan of  Yes, we can  resonating around the world. However, winning the position was the easy part, or so it seemed.  From the day he was president-elect, Barack Obama was in the hot seat, asked how he would now handle the burgeoning debt and bailouts that President Bush was leaving for him to solve. While Obama seeks to take the high road and tackle solutions, there is a degree of finger pointing and a somewhat high-brow blame game directed not only at his predecessor, but also the congressional Republicans who attempted to stymie progress on getting the country on its feet. Efforts were made to seek change, even during that interim time between the election win and Inauguration Day. It would not be an easy road for Obama as he started as America s leader, as seen in some of the early meetings with Republican leadership.  Amidst much of the blood, sweat, and tears in the middle of the memoir, Obama does take some time to recount his swearing-in, a monumental event for the country as a whole. While some could still not accept the idea of an African American as POTUS, many celebrated the event and the day took on an special excitement. There is wonderful explorations of sentiments as well as depictions of how Washington prepared for the big day, including the flubbing of the Oath of Office. It was significant, to say the least, but only one day of reprieve before returning to making a difference.  Obama discusses some of his early international summits and sentiments about his new  international friends and foes  in the form of world leaders. It is clear that some would be stronger allies than others, but Obama presents it as an attempt to get to know where he could turn and which leaders might be hiding knives up their proverbial sleeves. It is no shock which leaders fell into which categories, but I will leave it to the reader to uncover the list and Obama s sentiments throughout the tome. Either way, there is an excellent exploration of international diplomacy as some of the world s issues take the forefront of the discussion, including: the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as global shifts in politics and those nations who sought to exert their own form of control.  Obama sought to create new and lasting relationships on the international front, including thawing of relations with some countries whose enemy status could not be disputed. Iran proved to be one such country, though the frigidity of the late 1970s and into the 80s would not be easily forgotten. Obama sought to engage along nuclear energy terms, with the Iranians remaining sceptical and tepid throughout. However, there was a determination for America to lead, rather than vilify and point fingers, which appears to be what Obama did.  The book contrasts this nicely with talk of some domestic issues, though the most recollected  home-based  policy Obama had from his first term haunted him into the reign of America s Autocratic Whiner. Healthcare had long been a sticking point for American administrations, especially something that proved to be affordable. He sought to walk the fine line, particularly as there was a need to ensure congressional passage of the legislation, though Obama was determined to make a difference. As a Canadian, I was enthralled with the rhetoric that emerged on both sides, as though the idea of affordable healthcare for all (let alone, universal) was as inviting as cutting one s throat with a rusty tin can. Through some tugs and pulls, as well as serious negotiating to protect from a Republican filibuster in the Senate, a plan emerged with majority support in both houses.  Equally as troubling within America s borders was how to handle the economy post-2008. Obama spends significant time exploring how he sought to rebuild America, through a stimulus package that could help the country get back on its feet. From disdain over corporate bailouts to helping the  little guy  who was sucked into the mortgage market and left with nothing. While there was a degree of compassion to the Obama program, there had to be strict rules, some of which would not impress those within the Democratic Party. However, shouldering ahead was needed, while also trying to tackle many of the other issues left on the agenda.  This first volume of the memoir did not seek to defend Barack Obama as being correct all of the time, even when others refused to listen, but rather to give the reader a broad view of events and how they were seen from within. There were foibles throughout, something that Obama readily admits, but there were also some concrete plans to make things a great deal better, even if others blocked growth or success. Obama showed grit and determination, even as he admitted to being verbose. While the Obama Administration was sandwiched between two staunchly aggressive Republican presidents, they took action, rather than simply wandering around with a broom and dustbin. I believe that is one of the takeaways from this piece for me.  Much like his love to talk, Barack Obama shows that he enjoys putting words on the page. This is by no means a quick read, nor should it be. There is a significant amount of detail throughout the piece to educate and entertain the reader. Facts, perspectives, and raw sentiment cover many of the chapters, giving the reader the man s personal view on things from congressional battles, world leaders, and international diplomacy. Blunt and surely peppered with some honest to goodness language, the book may turn some away who seek to paint murals of the 44th POTUS, but it is the honesty that sobers the reader throughout this journey. With strong chapters and a personal touch on each page, this memoir tells the story without the flourishes and filters, while making the wait for the second instalment all the more painful. Still, I ll do it, as this book was so impactful, I cannot imagine what is yet to come!  Kudos, President Obama, for leading from the front. You made the hard decisions and did not rely on any news network to dictate how the winds were blowing or sycophants to pat your ego.  Love/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:   A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge:  29 book reviews: I usually don t have much interest in memoirs, but I liked learning about behind the scenes details of presidential decisions. The book is written with wit, humility and self-awareness. I listened to the audiobook read by the author. The narration was a sane, intelligent and reassuring reminder of better days. This was very long and is only part one; it doesn t even cover the entire first Obama term. I ll probably read part two, but I hope it isn t published any time soon. ",

    " Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones": "book reviews: A Book That Changed My Life  A book worth reading once a year.  In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn t actually writing anything.  When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn t feel any better than earlier in the day.  Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled,  Writing,  from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.  How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.  Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.  Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I could not believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.  Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. \"I want to rate X on the best reviewer list.\" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be.  Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.  Also, it talks about lofty goals.  Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I m going to run a marathon! I m going to write a book! I m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.  Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That s right. My goal was 6 books per year.  The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals.  Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority.  This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.  During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.  Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn t be a basketball player.  But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody s business. At Dave and Buster s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling?  As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?  If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year it really is that good!  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities    1 book reviews: This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.  But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not  breaking the chain . So while the author isn t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author s intellectual rigour.  Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under  Advanced Tactics  that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.  The three star rating I am giving this book doesn t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick.  2 book reviews: TLDR; - \"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\" - The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity. - Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. \"Read 30 books\"   \"Read before bed every night\"   \"Read one page\". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step. - Stick to the plan: \"Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way.\" Do not be a \"fair weather runner\" if you want to run a lot. - Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.  Most modern \"American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs\" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount.  ----- NOTES -----  *Identity* The three levels of change - the lower the more \"fundamental\": 3. Outcomes = Your goals 2. Processes = Your system 1. Identity = Who you perceive yourself to be  Make every action is a vote for what kind of person you want to become. Building habits is becoming the version of yourself you want to be. Habits help you to trust yourself. - Realize that \"You do not _have to_ do anything, you _get to_.\" - Ask \"What would a healthy person do?\". - Ask \"What feel like fun to you, but is work to others?\"   *Engineer it so that:* Things you want to achieve vs Things you want to avoid Obvious   Invisible Attractive  Unattractive Easy   Hard Satisfying  - Satisfying For example: if you want to watch less TV - keep it unplugged - only plugin if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch.  3 book reviews: This book and Emotional Intelligence Habits by Travis Bradberry are my two favorite self-improvement books. Atomic Habits teaches you how small habits (many of which you are not even aware of) compound over time to make a huge difference in your life. When you work to form good habits they accumulate and build upon each other and you see major changes with very small actions. The book has some suggested habits, but I wish there were many more (specific recommendations for good habits to adopt). That 's why I love Emotional Intelligence Habits so much. Emotional Intelligence Habits has more than 700 different habits targeting everything from happiness, confidence, likeability, relationships, leadership, productivity, dealing with toxic people, you name it. It 's an incredible book and these two go great together.  4 book reviews:  The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you re proud of how your hair looks, you ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you re proud of the size of your biceps, you ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you re proud of the scarves you knit, you ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.  What a doozy of a quote. I guess it pays to be a prideful guy.  Well, it seems luck is not on my side when it comes to personal development reads, and \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear is no exception. Despite the hype surrounding it, I find myself once again let down by a tired, regurgitated pop psychology book that fails to deliver.  The information presented feels like a rehash of what I have stumbled upon in the productivity blogosphere for the past decade. But it 's not just the lack of freshness that bothers me it 's the execution. The writing feels robotic, the repetition grows tiresome, and the cherry-picked anecdotes conveniently support the author 's points, often taken out of context. Even the scientific references feel shaky and questionable at times.  While the core ideas explored in \"Atomic Habits\" are not inherently bad, they have already been covered by other authors with more depth and skill. Writers like Kelly McGonigal and George Leonard come to mind, offering a richer exploration of the subject matter. Frankly, I ca not help but feel that the material in this book could have easily been condensed into a blog post or article. Instead, what I encounter is a bloated book filled with unnecessary fluff, making it feel like an extended infomercial for the author 's blog. It 's evident that this is just another platform to boost his personal brand and generate 'passive income'.  I guess the world really needed another privileged marketer with an A-type personality telling people they can become like him if they follow his  'secret formula.' It seems tailor-made for a specific group of individuals those who aspire to be the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire, like Tim Ferris, and his devoted followers.  P.S. I should note that despite my disappointment, I have come across individuals who found value in this book, claiming it transformed their lives. However, in most of those cases, they failed to sustain the new habits they initially adopted and years later it 's like they never read the book.  While \"Atomic Habits\" did not meet my personal expectations, it may still hold potential for people who are new to the subject or resonate with the author 's approach. And hey, if it floats your boat and makes you feel like the captain of your own destiny, who am I to rain on your parade? Happy reading!  5 book reviews: The first great book about habits was the Power of Habit. That book was quite theoretical and difficult to apply. This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.  My top 3 takeaways from this book are:  * Forget about goals, . * Change your identity . * Motivation is overrated. .  From this book, I distilled that you can read here:  6 book reviews:  Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.\"  Did not live up to the hype. There s good material here, and easy-to-follow strategies to improve our habits, but I found it a chore to wade through. My interest ebbed and flowed and ironically, I felt it could be the book to undo my healthy reading habits and routine.  succeeded in bringing awareness to my daily habits and making me more 'present'. The likes of  habit stacking  and  habit tracking  are things that I have started implementing since reading this. But while it s great to be self-aware and regularly analyse our behaviours, I found it tiresome after a while.    Tedious.  James Clear gives many examples of famous people who achieved success via their approach to habits. I enjoyed reading some of those, but far too often, content felt like it was being regurgitated from other books and work in the field of habits and human psychology. Sometimes it felt like he had simply thrown catchy new titles on pre-existing ideas and methods. Other times, it just seemed like common sense.  The book is not just about developing good habits and sticking to them, but about eliminating bad ones. I was pleased to see reference to   a book that already made a huge difference to my life! The importance of patience, the difference between  amotion'/'action' and the two-minute rule (when starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do) were all takeaways that resonated with me.  The chapter summaries were helpful to remember key points, but also made it clear there was substantial filler surrounding a couple of main ideas. These ideas are solid guidelines though, and no doubt helpful for building a better life - I guess time will tell.  It 's perhaps worth noting that my grievances with are in the minority - many find this book amazing, so do not let my words prevent you reading this if you think it could be helpful. After all, I am left wanting to eat healthier, improve my bedtime routines and embrace minimalism - so all this has to be good.   7 book reviews: Reading this book feels like reading a homework assignment. James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it does not, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:  * Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them. * Simplify science to the border of being wrong. * Abuse of \"as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____\" * Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.  The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book. If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.  Start with Why - Simon Sinek Mastery - George Leonard Outliers - Malcom Gladwell The Tipping Point - Malcom Gladwell Getting Things Done - David Allen The Element - Ken Robinson Behave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field] Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]  8 book reviews: I was prepared to dislike this book but I really enjoyed it!  I have seen it on so many list of \"life-changing non fiction\" next to deeply misogynistic authors and it 's popular with people promoting hustle culture so I did not expect it to work for me.  While I ca not say that the information in it is that different from other books I have read on the topic, it 's definitely the best breakdown of said info that I have seen.  Super accessible, bitesize chapters... absolutely go with the audiobook if you enjoy them. I did not want to sit while reading it because I was too busy reorganizing my space while listening to it!  Worth it  9 book reviews: Why do I keep doing this to myself? All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it 's filled with cute little platitudes like \"the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg\". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I have not heard from seven other productivity books already?  At one point Clear writes, \"I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you do not have an assistant...\"  I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It 's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.  The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you are fabulously rich, but, if you are like me and do not currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.  10 book reviews: The nuclear option for pimping, rebranding, fine-tuning, and perfecting grey cells. Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating.  To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.  The 1st Law Make it obvious Repetition and consequence, as if it wasn t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,  and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,  techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one s worst enemy, because it s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution.  The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easy As if this wasn t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.  The 4th Law Make it satisfying Reaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.  And as if all of this wasn t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,  As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,  even changing the obvious problems won t unleash the full potential.  A tip, after I ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing.  It s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I ve warned you.  One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn t care about whatever other people think.  I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let s call it possession instead. Afterward, it s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard.  This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,  manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol.  But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:       11 book reviews: This book just climbed to the top as my most favourite self-help non-fiction of the year!  Totally engaging and quite convincing in how the book makes you want to change your bad habits and adopt good ones, this book does not talk in a way to make you feel overwhelmed or make you feel like everything you do is wrong or inadequate.  The book does not give you impractical tips yet it tells stories and what to learn in how to gradually maintain habits that would benefit you in the long run as well as how to start maintaining habits that you have been wanting to in small practical steps.  This book is life-changing for me.  I have already adopted some of these tips yet the book makes me realise that there are many things that we do that we consider harmless yet taking up most of our time which make us frustrated in real.  The tips are easy to understand and follow. The writing is amazing. I would highly recommend this book.  This one is already changing my year and the rest of everything else that 's going to happen in how I make my future a better and a fulfilling one.   Too good to be true. Literally life changing    12 book reviews: There are many self-help books discussing the topics of habit. Some of them are written by famous authors like Stephen R. Covey, Charles Duhigg, and Timothy Ferris.  I read this book after reading the books by the above authors and was sure that I wo not get any new information. Despite discussing a similar topic, James Clear managed to pull a convincing book discussing these familiar ideas in a new way that will help us view our daily routine and life differently and will be a good choice if you are interested in the topic of productivity.      | | | | | | |  13 book reviews: This is the only book on 'habits' you should read. It lays out all the rules of changing/developing habits in a simple, straightforward way and gets right to the point without a bunch of rambling and seemingly unrelated filler chapters like some other self development books i have read. 14 book reviews: Can you get rid of your bad habits? Or maybe more importantly, establish good habits?    This had some useful tips in it that may help some people improve their quality of life by slowly (but steadily) forging good habits. One thing I felt would really work was the mentality. That 's a big one. We are all lazy creatures at our core, but some of us are better at streamlining things we do not like to do to make them easier to accomplish. What are you talking about, Anne?    Ok, so I noticed that my upstairs was a lot dirtier than my downstairs. If there was a pile of hair and fuzz on my bathroom floor, it would likely sit there until it became sentient. Why? Because my broom, mop, and cleaners were all downstairs. So, I went out and got the exact same stuff and set up a mini cleaning closet in my linen cabinet. And now that everything is within easy reach, my upstairs bathrooms look far less terrifying. Ta-da! I am keeping things clean using the power of laziness!    But the basic gist of what he talks about is really just giving up. If you did not go on a walk today, that does not mean that you are incapable of getting healthy. The plan is to just put on your shoes. If you can get up and put on your walking shoes, you are halfway there. Yes. Even if you just take your shoes right back off. The goal is to begin the habit with (pun intended) baby steps.    As far as self-help books go, this one seems reasonable. There 's no weird go-go-go mentality and you do not have to anything differently, other than to make very small positive changes that will set you up for success. You do not measure your success daily, you look at how far you have come over the course of a year. And with the mindset that doing positive to work towards getting better will get more results than if you had done nothing at all.     Some of his tricks and tips require a bit more structure (like getting someone to hold you accountable) but most of the things he tells you to do are pretty painless. And I have always found that sticking to simple, small, easy changes is the best way to get long-term results. Going on some crazy diet that cuts out all {insert food I love here}, never lasts past a year. But cutting down on processed sugar, eating more veg, and going on walks is a long-term doable way to achieve better overall health in the long run. Those types of habits do not necessarily get any sort of flashy results right away but you will be more likely to the results that you do get.   15 book reviews: I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway yesterday and immediately settled down to read it. I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear 's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.  16 book reviews: Hope everyone can read this review until the end.    Pick up this book thanks to a Tik-Tok video of a guy who showed different books recommended for personal development. I really wanted to start this year changing habits, incorporating  the good new  and eliminating the bad ones. From the first chapters I began to follow the steps and marveled with the achievements. I really recommend it to all who want to evolve and transform into any field of their lives. Or simply feel better with yourself. Based on this, I will be less active on GR. Although from time to time I will appear again here to see which readings you all enjoyed and read your great reviews.   --------------------------  Espero que puedan leer esta rese a hasta el final.    Llego a este libro gracias a un video en Tik-Tok de un chico que mostraba diferentes libros recomendables para el desarrollo personal. Realmente quer a arrancar este a o cambiando h bitos, incorporando  nuevos buenos  y eliminando los malos. Ya desde los primeros cap tulos empec  a seguir los pasos y me maravill  con los logros. Realmente lo super recomiendo a todos quienes quieran evolucionar y transformarse en cualquier  mbito de sus vidas. O simplemente sentirse mejor con ustedes mismos. En base a esto, voy a estar menos activa en GR aunque de vez en cuando volver  a aparecer por aqu  para ver cu les lecturas disfrutaron y leer sus geniales rese as.  17 book reviews: I am in the mood for more non fiction lately, so I decided to read the books of Ali 's book club. I wanted to read a book on habits for a long time now and Atomic Habits met all those criteria.  I am not gonna elaborate a lot since it is a well known book and there are a lot of YouTube videos that summed it up better than I can ever do including Abdaal 's video here:    Like all non-fiction books, I found most of the information in the book to be logical but the way it was written and ordered was pretty good. I found it engaging, easy to read and scientific. I enjoy it when authors provide data through real life stories and there was a lot of that here.  The book mostly discusses 4 laws to get into a habit or get out of one. These are: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying. And if you inverse those you get a way to lose bad habits. A very intriguing read!  18 book reviews: DNF at 45% I do not even want to waste any more time on this book with a full review. Here 's a quick rundown of why I hated it: Ableism throughout Bootstrap mentality Fatphobia throughout Condescending, patronizing tone from the author (even, or maybe especially, on the audio version.) I could go on...  This book had some valid, common sense points, but its flaws far overshadowed any redeeming qualities. Just...nope.  19 book reviews:                                             ,                 (    ,     ,       )                                                 ,                                                                                                                          20 book reviews:  Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.   I ve been trying so hard lately to break out of a funk and every self-help book I read recommends starting at the most basic level. We must sort out our daily habits before we can begin to feel better and more fulfilled in our lives. But how do we do this?  Gradual change is the answer. If we improve each day by just 1% by the end of the year we will be dramatically and unrecognizably better. Winning tiny battles will determine our future self. Identifying bad habits that are ruining our potential is the key to change. We must eradicate them, slowly, if need be, and replace them with habits that allow us to grow each day. We must set goals and work towards them in a sensible and patient fashion.    We also need to design a system to achieve our goals. Simply having goals is not enough. We need to have an actionable framework on how we can move towards these otherwise we will never reach them. We must have a process to follow and daily habits that allow us to achieve them. Our level of commitment to the process will determine our level of progress. Sticking to healthy proactive habits with our end goals in mind is the key.  So, here s a little bit about me and my goals for this year: I want to complete a 100-mile ultra-marathon and I also want to have written up a full draft of my PhD. How will I achieve these goals? Habitually running and writing each day, habitually working towards them and remaining committed to the process of daily improvement. I will also read everyday and review on Goodreads more frequently because it helps me remain focused on the process. Daily writing is so important for me as is learning and discovering more literature.  I quite enjoyed this. It proposes a very straightforward approach to being successful and one I am very keen to implement into my own life. So let s do this 2023!  ___________________________________  You can connect with me on social media via . __________________________________  21 book reviews:              !                                          !                                                      .                                                              . --------------------      :                  . ...                                        . ...                . ...                                   ...                                          . ...          :     ( ):            .

Most of the examples he put forward (other than ballet dancer Twyla Tharp and doctor Anne Thorndike), were about male stockbrokers, scientists, businessmen, sports figures (Michael Phelps, Magic Johnson) and comedians (Steve Martin, Chris Rock). Where are the successful women? Also, it was more about using habits to be \"successful\" in a traditional sense, by making your way to the top of the corporate ladder or excelling in whatever you do, being fit or elite or whatever, instead of improving relationships, decision making, work/life balance, or overall, just being a good person.  Funny, I was highlighting a bunch of material (a signal that I was full of hope!) in the first chapter, then it abruptly stopped, and I never highlighted another item in the whole book. The last thing I noted was on page 33, where some guy/entrepreneur says, \"I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure. My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I would not chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.... Suddenly, I was so proud of my fingernails.\" Here, I wrote, \"WTF?\" Sorry, but a statement like this reeks of privilege and frankly, makes me want to puke. I am concerned about his wife, and I ca not believe it got past the editors. Was this written in 2018 or 1988? In retrospect, this was the moment I should have abandoned the book and opted for something more relevant to my life.  Another problem I have with this book.... he talks much, in the beginning of the book, about identity change. \"The goal is not to read the book, it 's to become a reader.\" Or \"The goal is not to run a marathon, it 's to become a runner...\" Then in the last chapter, in his \"downsides to habit change\" he discusses how identity can hold you back. The key is to \"keep your identity small,\" (some investor guy says) because your identity will change as your role changes (or with age). So, \"I am an athlete\" becomes \"I am a person who is mentally tough and loves a challenge.\" \"I am a soldier\" becomes \"I am the type of person who is disciplined, reliable and great on a team.\" \"I am the CEO\" translates to \"I am the type of person who builds and creates things.\" So, the message is to have a flexible identity. I actually think this is key information that provides a healthy balance in life, and belongs right up there in chapter 1 with all the other information about identity. Rather, it 's an afterthought at the very end of the book. And it 's contradictory. Also, where is the \"I am a good listener. I am there for my kids. I make time to help others. I am a good friend.\" Are all habits so.... macho and self-centered? Maybe I missed the point, or maybe it was just the wrong book for me.  That said, I did pull some good information from chapter 13, the two-minute rule/habit shaping. When I opened it to this chapter in the book store where I bought it, I was intrigued. I thought this type of information could help me with my 2021 goals (which have been blown to bits). But I found it the most helpful chapter in the book, overall. I can use the \"art of showing up\" and the concept of not being consumed by the end goal in my life.  I learned: If you are a woman and you are looking for a book on habit change, pick up a book written by a woman; preferably one who has done her research and with whom you have something in common.  23 book reviews: \"Success is the product of daily habits not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\"  Goals are useful for charting a course, but systems are the most effective in moving forward. When you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time creating your systems, you will run into a few issues. The antidote is a systems-first mentality. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don t have to wait to permit yourself to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.        Highly recommended to understand the science behind habit building and practically implement those baby steps to build or break a habit.  Grab your copy or  24 book reviews: Well, there s almost no single shred of original content here. It could be a fine book if it s the first self-improvement book you have started to read.  The science is also flawed. He presents the following elements for habit: 1. Cue 2. Craving 3. Action 4. Reward Not to mention that its a skewed copy of principles presented in Power of Habits (to authors credit, he mentions it), craving starts to appear strongly only when your brain has learned to associate the cue, action, reward which happens with repetition.  Two star is a good score. It was merely okay. Given the earth-shattering noise it had made, I simply expected more.  25 book reviews: Muy buen libro. Todo el mundo deber a leerlo.  Este es otro gran amigo de papel que me encuentro en el camino; amigo que me otorga multitud de ense anzas para practicar en mi vida personal.  Qu  satisfecho me siento! Hab a le do y escuchado muy buenos comentarios de este libro por lo que mis expectativas eran altas, pero afortunadamente fue mejor de lo que esperaba.  Desde la introducci n me he sentido fascinado por la historia del autor, pero despu s, cada historia real y cada recomendaci n me ha parecido fant stica. El autor todo lo presenta de una forma tan sencilla, cada consejo parece ser mejor que el anterior, todo parece ideal; f rmula perfecta para alimentar el inter s del lector no solo para seguir leyendo sino tambi n para practicarlo en su vida real.  Siempre hab a tenido la creencia de que crear un h bito es algo supremamente dif cil pero despu s de esta lectura siento que he estado errado much simos a os y que realmente es bastante sencillo. Siempre hab a buscado un m todo que me ayudara a centralizar mi vida, a clasificar lo bueno y lo malo, a encontrar un fort n desde el cual dirigir, y creo que eso es exactamente lo que he hallado en esta ocasi n.  Motivaci n, pragmatismo, sabidur a. Todo eso lo encontr  aqu . Cuando realice la rese a completa contar  un poco c mo me ha ido despu s de aplicar en mi vida personal los principios de esta obra. Les contar  que buenos h bitos he logrado establecer. Tambi n les contar  cu les han sido los negativos que he logrado abandonar.   26 book reviews: Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, James Clear  If you are having trouble changing your habits, the problem is not you. The problem is your system.  Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you do not want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you will get a proven system that can take you to new heights.  Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work.  Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.  Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.           :                                                  :                                                                                      :        :            :                              :                                     :                                   ...   :                         2018    :                                        :                1397   320   9786226010221   :               -   21    :    :                                        :                        1397   283   9786008738701       1398             1399       1400    :                      1397   300   9786008755777    :            :               [       ]           1398   288   9786229531488       1399    :    :                                            :                        1398   364   9786222100087    :          :                  1399   360   9786229600320    :        :                        1399   219   9786222540319    :    :                        1399   237   9786008981725    :    :                           1399   224   9786226699174    :    :                                          1399   63     978600861090    :    :                                                :    1399   272   9786226412773    :     :                                                  1400   216   9786229807576     ....                                                                              :                                                                                                           : (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .                                               :                                        .                                                                                                                                                     .)           04/08/1400     .    27 book reviews: Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones is a practical framework for how to build and keep new habits. To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests:  - Make it Obvious - Make it Attractive - Make it Easy - Make it Satisfying  While at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible.  Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated   Mastery requires practice.  is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes.  28 book reviews: Ideea c r ii este pe c t de simpl  pe at t de adev rat   i puternic   i o ave i chiar  n descrierea din subtitlu. Autorul folose te o mul ime de exemple pentru a ar ta c : 1. Schimb rile mici pot avea un impact foarte mare  n vie ile noastre. Dac  hale ti zilnic un burger de la Mec sau o g leat  de pui de la Kafece, peste zece ani nu- i va pl cea deloc ce vei vedea  n oglind   i nici ce- i va ar ta c ntarul. Dac  alergi juma de or  pe zi, lucrurile vor sta cu totul altfel. 2. Obiceiurile noastre sunt comportamente automate pe care le  nv m din experien . Intri  ntr-o camer   n care e  ntuneric, vei c uta automat  ntrerup torul. De-aia, diferen a pe termen lung o fac rutinele zilnice. Dac  ele sunt bune, rezultatul pe termen lung e excelent. 3. Construie ti obiceiuri bune schimb nd lucruri  n via a ta  i  nconjur ndu-te de lucruri care declan eaz  acele obiceiuri pe care le vrei  n via a ta. Eu nu am reu it s  repet consistent la chitar , de pild , p n  c nd nu am avut patru chitare, puse  n locuri strategice: la masa din buc t rie la care stau destul de mult, la birou,  n dormitor,  n terasa de l ng  cas ,  n care petrec ceva timp  n weekend lucr nd. La fel, cu exerci iile fizice. Am amenajat o sal  la redac ie, de care eu  i colegul Marote profit m din plin, dar am  i acas   matereale , benzi elastice, gantere, kettlebell, saltea, banc , lad  pentru s rituri, tot ce-mi trebuie pentru antrenamente complete  i variate.

Nu neap rat cum a f cut un inginer irlandez, care a legat o biciclet  de exersat acas  la computer, astfel  nc t Netflixul, de care omul era dependent, nu rula dec t la o anumit  vitez  a bicicletei, dar trebuie s  legi activitatea de un rezultat care  i face pl cere. Uite, eu, de pild , pun periodic pe re elele sociale poze dup  antrenamentele la sal . Iar faptul c  oamenii apreciaz  munca pe care o fac pentru mine - da, oamenii se mul umesc s -i aplaude pe al ii, prea pu ini se  i apuc  de treab  - m   ncarc   i pe mine, astfel  nc t s  pot continua. 5.

Uite, eu, de pild , nu pot s  adorm dac  nu m  uit la ceva film sau meci sau emisiune. A a c  primul pas a fost s  scot cablul tv din dormitor. Apoi, am recurs la tablet .  i am observat c  dac  pun un film sau un meci nu adorm, m   ine treaz ac iunea. A a c  am luat cea mai bun  decizie din via a mea: adorm sear  de sear  ascult nd cursuri. Fie c  e vorba de Masterclass, fie c  e vorba de tot felul de prelegeri ale unor profesori puse pe yt (mare chestie yt premium, c  nu te mai opresc reclamele), fie c  e vorba de podcasturi, dau drumul  i  n cel mult zece minute adorm (asta  i dup  ce am adoptat o rutin  de respira ie care induce somnul - inspir num r nd p n  la patru, expir num r nd p n  la 8, adormi ca un copil, tati!) 6.  ine un jurnal cu schimb rile pe care le faci, cu obiceiurile bune  i cu efectele lor. Uite, a te poza periodic  i a compara pozele este o bun  metod  de a r m ne motivat, pentru c  schimb rile se v d de la o lun  la alta, de la un anotimp la altul, de la un an la altul.  Cam asta ar fi. Cei mai mul i dintre oameni e ueaz   n adoptarea unor obiceiuri bune pentru c  vor rezultate imediate, pentru c  nu au deloc r bdare  i viziune, nu se pot vedea pe ei peste doi-trei ani, pentru c  nu  tiu cum s  r m n  motiva i, pentru c  pun gre it problema.

Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn t say  verified purchaser  next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.  I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.  One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:  - Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface  working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college  - Pg. 17, chapter 2  I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady . Why does her being white matter? - Pg. 20, chapter 2,  My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent . Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest? - Pg.44, chapter 4,  Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.  Ok, did it matter that were black in this context? - Pg. 71,  mostly white students  Context? History? Why did this matter? - Pg. 74,  one of the few nonwhite  - Pg. 74,  my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice  Again, who cares if they were white? - Pg. 75,  Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman . Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way. - Pg. 120,  Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.  I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said  other than make and white  got a lot under my skin (remember I m not white). - Pg. 148,  He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend  Ok, those white people again. - Pg. 148,  In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago s famous cronyism.  The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right? - Pg. 205,  Our counselor Dr.Woodchurch, let s call him was a soft-spoken white man who d gone to good school and always wore khakis . Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white. - Pg. 208,  The nervousness of white people . Sigh. - Pg. 218,  Its whiteness and maleness .  Sigh.  I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I m not black and I was born in the 80 s and not the 60 s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I m wrong about her when it comes to this.  Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I am not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he was not always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I am pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.  - Pg. 96.  What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,  -  Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy  pg. 97 -  Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.  Pg. 97 -  I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.  Pg. 97 -  Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.  Pg. 99 -  There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.  Pg.99 -  He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn t yet know where it would lead.  Pg. 101 -  Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.  Pg. 103 -  He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.  Pg. 105 -  Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him this strange mix-of-everything man.  Pg. 105 -  Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why . Pg. 111 -  This, I was learning, was how Barack s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.  Pg. 112 -  I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.  Pg.117 -  And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.  Pg. 123 -  All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack s strong sense of purpose sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.  Pg.131 - For better or worse, I d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was.  We can handle this, right?  he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it.  We re strong and we re smart, and so are our kids. We ll be just fine. We can afford this.  Pg.224  I ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.  Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested): - She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing. - Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated. - She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life. - She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter. - She failed the bar exam the first time around - She very much dislikes politics - She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell. - She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha. - Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house - She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don t know if she is always successful. - She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.  Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn t making the positive impact she wanted too. Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle s life in one word is would be  busy  and one word to describe Michelle herself would be  workaholic . She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.  Bottom Line: To be blunt, I am not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I ca not say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself \"who cares?\". Shrug, I just did not see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say  yeah, I read that book .  That being said, it isn t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.  As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me.  Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn t that good. I didn t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my  identity  but I had to otherwise I just would ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the  identity  of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.  So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole  grab them by the pussy  remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.  1 book reviews: I didn t think I could admire and respect former First Lady Michelle Obama any more than I already did. For eight years she graced our country with her presence, her intellect, her caring. We never had to ask because it is obvious in everything she says and does that she does care. Without a doubt, she cares more than anything about her family, but also cares deeply about this country. Then I read this book, an eloquent memoir, strikingly honest and as inspiring as I suspected it would be. I felt even more admiration and respect for her.  She recounts her time growing up on the South Side of Chicago as she shares the joys of her childhood as well as some of the tough things. She was a feisty child, driven to do well in school. Her story begins :  I spent much of my childhood listening to the sound of striving.  She speaks lovingly of her roots in this working class family - her parents and her brother and grandparents and how their values shaped the adult she would become. We witness the grief she experienced over the loss of her father and her continuing admiration and love for her mother who was tenacious in seeking a good education for her children. In this memoir, she is so open and honest and it feels so intimate. Michelle shares her love for her husband and daughters. She speaks about the discrimination against the men in her family, about being black at Princeton, about the attacks on her husband s citizenship, a conspiracy theory primary pushed by the person who unfortunately followed him after his second term. We discover who she is in the times she is undergoing a self discovery, as she questions her aspirations, as she juggles work and motherhood as Barack s involvement and aspirations in politics grow. It felt so intimate as she shares some personal struggles that they faced, ones that I don t think she ever divulged publicly previous to this.  The things she chose to focus on as First Lady - children and their health, assisting military families, developing a program for mentoring young women reflect the things that are important to her and the kind of person she is. With an intellect such as hers, she easily could have taken on larger policy issues, but instead focused on children and families bringing people into the White House who would not have had the opportunity to be there if not for her. This book is over 400 pages and it never felt long. The writing is good and I just kept turning page after page always interested in what she would say next. A remarkable story of a remarkable woman.  2 book reviews: I d been lucky to have parents, teachers, and mentors who d fed me with a consistent, simple message: You matter. As an adult, I wanted to pass those words to a new generation.  Look, I am not a happy crier. I might cry at songs about leaving and missing someone; I might cry at books where things do not work out; I might cry at movies where someone dies. I have just never really understood why people get all choked up over happy, inspirational things. But Michelle Obama 's kindness and empathy changed that.  This is not really a book about politics, though political experiences obviously do come into it. It 's a shame that some will dismiss this book because of a difference in political opinion, when it is really about a woman 's life. About growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago; about getting married and struggling to maintain that marriage; about motherhood; about being thrown into an amazing and terrifying position.  I hate words like \"inspirational\" because they have become so overdone and cheesy, but I just have to say it-- . I had the privilege of seeing her speak at The Forum in Inglewood, and she is one of the warmest, funniest, smartest, down-to-earth people I have ever seen in this world.  And yes, I know we present what we want the world to see, but I truly do think it 's genuine. I think she is someone who really cares about people - especially kids - and wants to give them better lives and opportunities.  She 's obviously intelligent, but she also does not gussy up her words. She talks straight, with an openness and honesty rarely seen. She 's been one of the most powerful women in the world, she 's been a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School, she 's had her own successful career, and yet she has remained throughout that same girl - Michelle Robinson - from a working class family in Chicago.  I do not think there 's anyone who would not benefit from reading this book.  | | | |  3 book reviews: I understand the hype!  I did not know much about Michelle Obama nor her husband. This book absolutely humanized them and show me how much they care about others. The contrast with the actual political situation is blatant.  Recommend!  4 book reviews: i m so glad that i got the audiobook for this back and finally was able to finish all these months later!  michelle obama sharing her experience and dropping nuggets of wisdom into my ear holes for 19 hours straight was just a delightful experience :) 5 book reviews: MICHELLE MY HEART    this is going to be good 6 book reviews: I m so thrilled to add Becoming to my list! A powerful, surprising and moving book as well as refreshingly candid that I think will be deeply inspirational to many. 7 book reviews: Loved this! 8 book reviews: Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own. Michelle Obama, First Lady of the United States, quickly became one of the most iconic women of the White House.  In this memoir, she reflects on what her life was like as she was raised on the South Side of Chicago and her roots in her working class family. We learn about her college life and her career as a lawyer.  Along the way, she felt when she lost her father too soon. And we get to, a junior lawyer, and what it was like dating (and eventually marrying) the future president.  And from there, we learn what the White House is like - from the gardens to the galas, Michelle Obama walks through every aspect of juggling work, motherhood and being the First Lady. Oh my gosh. People. This was perfect.  This had me hooked from the very start.  It was beautiful, it was poignant, it made me cry in public - it had everything I could have wanted in a memoir and more.  When she talked about her love for her father, and how painful that loss was, . It truly got to me in the best way possible.  Also, learning about the rest of her family - her brother, parents and grandparents - really helped me understand what her childhood was like and how it shaped her into the wonderful woman she is today.  I was surprised about what she all accomplished when in the White House and I am really shaking my head at how I missed knowing this earlier.  We were so lucky and blessed to have this woman in our White House - | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  9 book reviews: Audiobook read by Michelle Obama  For the past three days - all I wanted to do was listen to Michelle Obama..... I cried - or was teary-eyed so many times - I lost count. THIS BOOK must be  especially  special to her immediate family and closest friends ....but it s also a great gift to the rest of us. Nobody else but Michelle could have written this book - it s so MICHELLE S STORY! She is gifted in her ability to express her own emotions- write with tremendous insight and sensitivity and from beginning to end it s artistically rendered with meticulous attention to details.  Michelle questioned herself ....was a very hard worker - determined to achieve her goals academically. She wanted to do well. No matter how great she was doing she still had insecurities - doubted herself. She questioned,  am I good enough?   MICHELLE IS GOOD ENOUGH! We are blessed to have her  - simply sharing HERSELF - BEING HERSELF - SHARING ABOUT HER LIFE - HER PARENTS - HER THOUGHTS - FEELINGS - PROJECTS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO HER....HER MARRIAGE - HER DAUGHTERS - HER FAMILY FRIENDS - BEING A WOMAN - BEING BLACK - LESSONS SHE HAS LEARNED AND IS STILL WORKING OUT - HER WARMTH -HER HUMOR- HER HONESTY & HUMANITY - etc. etc. etc. MICHELLE IS A NATURAL LEADER - A PRESENCE WE ARE DRAWN TO - CAN WE LOVE A PUBLIC FIGURE MUCH MORE? Perhaps.... but it s very easy to love Michelle Obama .....  For me..... It would be fun just to sit with my friends over drinks and yummy treats for a few hours and all pick this book apart  - sharing our favorite parts - AS THERE ARE MANY ***FAVORITE*** parts!!!! I m happy to host a gathering at my house anytime!!!    Michelle has made it clear - she is never running for office. If you listened to this audiobook for 19 hours - every word - such as I did - I guarantee you won t doubt her  never running  announcement. She will contribute her way! Politics is nasty and mean and it s not the place for her.... she doesn t hold back in expressing how she feels about it either. I can t blame her. At the same time it was quite beautiful how she totally understands her husbands brilliant mind and vision - how Barack was the perfect candidate at the perfect time. Oh she would ve rather had Obama a regular family man, but he was the type of man she herself would have wanted for President. She grew into becoming comfortable with his running. They did well overall....as husband and wife and as parents while also being in the life of politics --living in the white house with security guards everywhere they went. Michelle raised two daughters in the White House as normal as she could. A frightening story about wild sedated animals will having you saying .....  What the f#@k ? But have no fear .....the story ends well. :)   Many memories came flooding back around Barack s campaign and Election Day. I was teary eye during much of this part. Parts I remembered well - other personal circumstances that Michelle had to share about the campaign, I knew nothing about. Much made me sad and angry - Election Day had my nerves stirred all over again ... only this time I was more intimately with the Obama family.  The beginning of this Audiobook.....we find Michelle at home....home alone. Not at the White House. She was no longer the First Lady. Simply a night alone in her own house. None of us readers have lived in the White House - but she shares a story that most readers will connect with. It s priceless, moving, and powerful. I suggest taking a moment to reflect on your  own  similar experience. I m sure a memory will surface! Enjoy it. A moment of solitude. If you like cheese toast - this might be a time to have a slice.  Michelle spends a long time telling us about her early childhood. I questioned  parts  of this for awhile - I wasn t sure why I needed to know sooooo many details. But - during a break from listening to the audiobook is when I did some serious reflecting. My feelings changed from feeling a little impatient - as in  how much more do I need about the family games you played in the evening, or details about kids in the neighborhood- and every description of your house - your aunt Robbie s personality, your grandpas carpentry skills, etc. ...how much more of this Michelle?  .... But then.....during my break ....( my first cry).... I understood my own and impatience . The light went off for me of why this portion of the book was valuable to me and also triggering. Michelle taught me things in this book about being black  - really being black   not just a woman and black   but what she went through all her life as a very hard working BLACK women WHO ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP REACHING - achievement oriented- her goals were important to her. Being one of the few blacks within mostly a white environment for soooo many years was a constant pressure. Her years at Princeton really shows what she went through. I learned something else from Michelle too ..... Things about her  family  - her parents - the tight knit ways they all were with one another - her incredible love for he older brother ..... and even though Michelle was black and lived on the south side of Chicago ..... she had things that I never had my childhood. She had two parents who were deeply dedicated to her and her brother Craig. Her parents gave up so much of their own lives to provide everything for their children. I literally fell apart with gushing tears during my break - I didn t have a childhood anything close to hers.  When I returned to listening to the Audiobook  Michelle was still talking about how wonderful her mom was and dad were, their family car - the Buick - family time *together*.....SO MUCH FAMILY TIME - HAPPY MEMORIES..... something shifted in me. I didn t want rush her childhood any longer. I wanted to try to imagine the type SHE HAD. Once I stopped fighting my uncomfortableness - I was transforming through  her  family.  When Michelle hit her teenage years, I was a little envious. I wanted to be girlfriends with her. I liked her. Hanging out at her house after school - meeting her mom and those gracious sandwiches her mom prepared for Michelle and her girlfriends was just cozy wonderful. I was reminded how much I loved my close friends - Renee, Lisi, and Barbara. Great girlfriends during the teen years makes life so much more tolerable and  fun . I wanted to be friends with Michelle.....feel safe in her home......cherished her mom and dad too. It was impossible not to fall in love with not only Michelle - but her parents - brother Craig - Susan ( Michelle s best friend in college), and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, My affinity was also warm for people who supported their family in the White House. Also for Michelle s female colleagues from her work at City Hall in Chicago ....and of course Barack Obama.  Barack gets  guy-of-the-year  award - the night he asked Michelle to marry her. GREAT STORY!  Let s face it ..... Barack & Michelle are adorable!! Bright - have dignity - are gracious! They undeniably love each another. They had challenges..... but as a committed couple they practiced, learn, and got better over time figuring out what empowered their relationship - and what didn t. They were not too proud to attend therapy for support ( and Michelle was not too proud to share with the world to read). They looked for solutions - rather than attacked - found fault and blamed. Barack and Michelle are grounded in love - willing to support each individually as whole separate beings. They are also emotionally connected in matters of the heart. They may have had a challenging relationship - logistics alone - but a healthy love relationship based on respect and trust. Yep.... they are a couple much like Paul and I.    Michelle and Barack s wedding with their  wedding song  by Stevie Wonder ....  You and I Can Conquer The World .....was such a beautiful part of this story.... MY GOD....at one point I said to myself,  they really are a fairy tale couple .....lol I usually ever even  think  like that. .....but their wedding did feel beautiful.....surrounded by many people who loved them both. The only thing that would have made the wedding scene better would have been ...... If on the Audiobook....they played Stevie Wonder singing the song. It s soooo beautiful!!! Sing   along .... You and I Can Conquer The World .   Who knows what  Willy Worm  is? Michelle mentioned she was rushing off to Willy Worm class with Sasha when she was a toddler....and I said,  what the heck is that? ... look it up....it s cute. Might drive adults nuts, though.    I loved hearing about Michelle s high school AND college years..... Yet I felt angry  with  her that years later during the Barack Obama campaign, somebody dug up an old paper that Michelle wrote when she was at Princeton as a young college student and wrote nasty things saying she was a black radical. So much UGLY news of pure crappy political lies were being spread about her during the campaign. Fox News talked about her militant anger - and she was accused of calling white people whities. Total lies - outlandish hurtful lies that exhaustive Michelle. And who could blame? All the while Michelle was trying to be positive and supportive.  Michelle has contributed to other potential first ladies by writing this book. Michelle was more active than many spouses of candidates in campaigning for their husbands  But in the future we will see more of this. For over a year Michelle had zero support from the Obama campaign team. Nobody supported her. She wasn t getting any speech writing experts. Apparently, while Michelle was campaigning - traveling from state to state - not with Obama - everything was going great until all of a sudden it wasn t. Things turned ugly and hurtful fast. This part of the book gives useful information that others can learn from. Any future wife of a candidate running for President in the future could get an awful lot of value out of reading this portion of the shelves memoir. I m sorry Michelle paid a painful price ....but she paved the way of possibilities to help  both sides  of wives of running candidates in the future.   It s hard to finish this book without any tears. I totally love both Michelle and Barack. So many of us are heartbroken with where our country is now ..... This book comes at a good time. It s a great holiday gift!   A cute moment... Michelle learned early in childhood that she could discuss things with her parents. Her parents would listen to her ideas...Even debating was allowed. She was little. She asked her mother one day,  why do we eat eggs in the morning?  That led to a discussion about the value of protein. So Michelle thought about it and did a little research and realize that peanut butter had protein. She likes Peanut butter, but she didn t like eggs. So she was able to negotiate. For the next nine years she had a thick peanut butter sandwich every morning for breakfast and never ate an egg again.  Years later a college counselor was the opposite of listening to Michelle. The woman didn t value who she was ( a MERIT SCHOLAR - top 10% of her graduating class),..... she told Michelle she wouldn t be   Princeton material . Michelle will slowly getting stronger and believing in herself.... but was definitely vulnerable and sensitive to a feeling inside of not being good enough. But that day she decided she was going to at least apply to Princeton..... she went and got her recommendation letter from a great neighbor who also worked at the school. She never talk to that counselor again.... In other words she wasn t the woman she celebrated with when she was accepted.  Michelle Robinson Obama - is helping breakdown those prejudices just by speaking out - her voice is powerful - she s more than good enough! She s A GIFT TO OUR COUNTRY.....a woman who continues to be true to herself - making a difference being who she is .....just keep her sharing!  10 book reviews: Michelle Obama won spoken-word Grammy from audiobook. Cannot wait to listen from the beginning of her fantastic life journey!  OMG I couldn t put it down! I haven t read so many biographies or memoirs for so long but after starting that one I berated myself for procrastinating for so long to get this book into my hands.   It was fascinatingly riveting, intriguing, inspirational, powerful, moving! It s so hard to find role models in our modern world because the appearance, faking, imitation, being artificial are the main values to find some place at the upper level. (The system pushes you kiss more ass to become a winner.)  Instead of being honorable first lady, Ms. Obama always attract attention with her fight for social issues even though how controversial, unconventional and challenging they were which made her iconic figure. She is unique. She loves greens, she loves to exercise, she loves to dance. She is different from the other first ladies we ve been introduced throughout the centuries, isn t she? I cannot imagine so of them dance with Jimmy Fallon at his late night show or play soccer team of James Corden.  Let s get a closer look st the book: It is divided into 3 main chapters:  Becoming Me  is about early childhood and family life of Obama at South Side of Chicago. Not a wealthy, easy childhood and at young age she loses her father who suffered from multiple sclerosis. But also we see her ambition, success at her school years and take a close look to her education at Princeton and Harvard Universities. Then she starts to work at Sidley Austin and meets with Mr. Barack Obama.  The second part:  Becoming Us ; my favorite part of the book. Lately I read so many silly, nonsense romance books. Everything about them was extra far- fetched. But when I read something that directly captivates my heart and makes you feel for the couple, I know that I m in the right tracks. Their love story excited me. It made me smile and sigh several times. Actually I made so many  awww  voices that my husband thought I was watching  Love Actually  for hundredth time. So yes, it was real, it melt my heart and I loved the parts about their marriage. And yes, this part also tells us Barack Obama s political carrier and ends with the election night in 2008! Yes he was elected President of the United States.  I actually liked the story about Obamas   giving up the corporate law to do something meaningful. You know they can easily pay the humongous, terrifying student loans with making an impressive amount of money by working as corporate lawyers.  And the final part is  Becoming More  tells us the first family life.  Overall: I enjoyed this memoir. It is one of my fastest, impressing, touching readings. I loved Michelle Obama s two quotes that really work as my life mottos which are:   Choose people who lift you up  and  Find people who will make you better   Thankfully I did. And I loved this book. I d better read more memoirs.      11 book reviews: I am surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this. I was engrossed the whole time and even teared up at some parts. Even when I was not reading the book, I was still thinking about Michelle Obama 's story. I loved that rather than a rehashed Wiki article of her successes, this was a reflective coming-of-age story that will be inspiring to so many women and people of color who are struggling to find themselves. I loved experiencing Michelle 's life alongside her with all her triumphs and heartbreaks. She gives insight not only to what her experiences were like in the White House, but also why she chose certain initiatives during her time as FLOTUS, and how her childhood and upbringing added to her perspective. I especially loved that for all the success she s had, she always brings it back to how there are so many other kids out there possible of change who just needed the right guidance and opportunities. Her perspective is valuable and very much needed. I was moved hearing her story, and very much appreciate the reminder that even in a bleak country, there are good human beings out there.  12 book reviews: \"I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not for one second did I think I would be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody who has the words 'first' and 'black' attached to them ever would. I stood at the foot of the mountain, knowing I would need to climb my way into favor.\"  God, do I miss the Obamas.  Since I have had the right to vote, two presidents have energized and excited me Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. That 's not to say that I agreed with everything they did, or that there were not times when they disappointed me. But in both cases, their candidacy and then their campaigns for re-election motivated me enough to volunteer, excited me enough to be fraught with nerves as election results came in, gave me cause for celebration, and left me sad when their terms ended.  Reading Michelle Obama 's new memoir, , reminded me of those times. It also reminded me just what a fan I have been of hers since watching her and her daughters when President Obama declared his candidacy for the White House almost 12 years ago, since hearing her speak at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. I was always wowed by the sheer joy she appeared to have for the job of First Lady, despite the overwhelming amount of cruelty she and her family were subjected to throughout her husband 's two terms as President.  With , she gives you a glimpse into her childhood and her relationship with her parents, which definitely impacted the way she carried herself throughout her life and how she raised her two daughters. It tells of her ambitions, her desire to help make the world a better place (one clearly shared by her husband), the challenges of marriage and motherhood, and how she dealt with her husband 's political ambitions. She talks of her desire to make an impact as First Lady while at the same time ensuring her daughters' lives were as \"normal\" as they could possibly be, and the successes, frustrations, and disappointments she experienced.  I love the matter-of-fact way she shares her feelings and experiences, revealing emotions and fears and moments of anger, as well as the moments of sheer joy, as mother, as wife, as daughter, and as First Lady. While she certainly reveals instances when she felt she was not treated fairly by the media or by those unhappy with her husband (or her), this is not a tell-all book. She is critical of those that deserve her scorn, but even when she did not see eye to eye with people, she did not tear them to pieces.  For the most part, the Michelle Obama you have seen at public appearances, on television shows, and in photos, is the Michelle Obama you get in . And that feels just right. This is a woman who loves her life, loves her country, and most importantly, loves her husband, her children, and her family. She does not overinflate her importance or her contributions as First Lady but she realizes she held a position few women have through history, and to be the first black woman to be First Lady made her a role model in the eyes of so many. It may have been a position she was not always comfortable with, but it is a role in which she absolutely shone.  \"For me, becoming is not about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey does not end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to and be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person. I have become, by certain measures, a person of power, and yet there are moments when I still feel insecure or unheard. It 's all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there 's more growing to be done.\"  There was much to enjoy about this book, much to think about, and much to savor. And, at least for me, much to reminisce about.

Becoming Us, departs from the beginning of their romantic relationship and follows their marriage, the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.

There is not much I could discuss this book, because everything I could possibly say lays already between the pages of it, so I would make this quick because this is the most important idea of my review: , thanks for coming to my TED Talk, have a fine day.  is the complex road Life chose for Michelle to go to and the story of how she became who she is now: a woman of integrity, loved by so many and who inspires towards kind purposes in life. Michelle is a superhero of a nation. But she is just so much more than that. She is a normal person with normal habits, dreams and aspirations, with a ludic nature and a nice sense of humour. She 's a fabulous mother to her daughters, a fabulous wife and friend to her husband, a fabulous daughter to her parents.  Michelle Obama inspires. Maybe she doesn t realise it. Or maybe she does. She talks about things that bother her, raising an alarm to the rest of the world. Talking about racism, feminism, health issues, poverty, even peace, Michelle inspires with her words because if she likes it or not, her words weigh.  I take off my hat for this incredible, real-life Wonder Woman and I take the liberty to say only this: even though I have no direct connection whatsoever with anything this woman has ever done in her life, I just feel the need to say THANK YOU MICHELLE LAVAUGHN ROBINSON OBAMA FOR EVERYTHING YOU VE DONE FOR THIS WORLD AND THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION! Thank you for inspiring me. I owe you one in heaven (supposing that I even get there LOL).  ()  15 book reviews: I just finished this PHENOMENAL book seriously, probably THE best autobiography I ve ever laid my hands on! It s now in vogue the coolest new trend for people to write a book about their lives, and I respect that trend for allowing us to read more TRUE, REAL stories about REAL people. BUT, Becoming is the first autobiography I ve ever felt I ve truly connected with, learned from and became a better person for having read it. Within these pages, I both saw myself and re-found myself within Michelle Obama s narrative; I saw myself in her story and have truly learned a few life changing lessons from this 421-page journey she s shared with us. It is a rare thing, indeed, for me to be able to say that about any book that I identified with the words, felt the words in a heartfelt way and came away changed because of those series of words on a page that had been so thoughtfully and candidly laid out.    I had the honor of going to see Michelle Obama on her book tour at her Washington D.C. stop the Sunday after Thanksgiving. (In an ironic full circle of events in my experience with this book, I went to see her speak with a friend I met on Goodreads who has become a very close friend of mine.) Michelle Obama was everything. She was witty and frankly hilarious; she was open and forthright; she was graceful and dignified, a true orator and inspiration.    The tickets to this event sold out within hours--a completely filled arena, pictured above as it is starting to fill.  Both in her book and in her talks, she speaks openly about what it was like to be a young black girl from the South Side of Chicago during the time when whites were fleeing the area and poverty seemed to be creeping its way in to becoming a young woman at Princeton, unsure of her footing in the new social climate but still clinging to her rigidly drawn-up plan and schedule for her life (of which becoming First Lady was never a part).    She walks us through graduating from college and enduring the loss of one of her best friends to an aggressive cancer at the young age of 26 years old and how this changed her outlook on the world and her path through it. Within these pages you ll learn how she first met Barack Obama, a man who would change her world and ours in so many ways how he arrived at work late that first day she was to mentor him, wet from the rainy day outside but still sure of himself and confident in a way that spoke of humility. From IVF to being a senator s wife to the horrible shock of how dirty and personal politics can turn, Michelle Obama gives us an insightful glimpse into her journey into and out of the White House, her personal trek into becoming the icon she is today a label she still humbly finds bewildering but that she has learned to hone for the betterment of our nation and the society-focused programs she has championed.  Throughout it all, Michelle Obama s outlook is optimistic, her voice clear, witty, candid and insightful. How did she feel the first time she experienced life inside of the presidential motorcade? What fears did she have of exposing her daughters to the  maw  of public life? And how did she accommodate her outlook on politics       and her negative experience within the whirlwind of it   A Fox news chyron   to achieve what she has, and with such grace, for our nation, the Democratic party, for children and for people (girls and women especially) of color?  Just as the discerning look at the viciousness of American politics will enrage you and make you question the leaders we ve elected to power, so will Michelle Obama s experience with the other side of her First Lady journey, the experience with the purity of spirit of genuinely good people no matter their political affiliations, nationality or socio-economic status move you.    As I read , I HAD to read it with a pen and highlighter in hand, hence why it took me so long to complete it. I had to savor every word, go back and re-read passages. Just today, as I was nearing the epilogue, a woman sitting next to me asked,  What are you studying?  I turned the book over and told her,  Michelle Obama s .  I hope that gives you an idea of the intensity and connection with which I read this book. To say that I highly recommend this book to any and everyone especially to American women, women of color and people who have felt persecuted or  othered  by their upbringings or the color of their skin would be a clear understatement. There is so much truth and integrity and raw emotion to be pointed out in this autobiography, but to do so here would be to write a whole book about the marvels of book. What I will say is that earned an easy 5 stars before I d even finished the preface and continued in its discerning excellence thereafter. There is truly something within these pages for everyone because, as Michelle Obama so elegantly states:       | | | |  16 book reviews: This book is poorly written. Only fans of M.O. could possibly like this book as it does not stick to facts. They are the only ones allowed to give reviews of it. I wonder what is being said about Trump books? My review has been deleted twice. Hopefully I am allowed to say this little bit. 17 book reviews: This isn t so much a review as it is a tiny opportunity to thank the book gods for all the opportunities reading and books have given me. Getting to meet and share time with Michelle Obama was one of the craziest highlights of my professional life and speeding through this book to finish it in time will always be one of the funniest reading experiences I ve ever had.   18 book reviews: 4,5 estrellas, solo porque hubo partes que me parecieron innecesarias (?), pero en general lo AM . Le ten a miedo porque es largu simo (el audiolibro dura 19 horas), pero conforme m s avanzaba, MENOS QUER A QUE SE ACABARA. 19 book reviews: Whatever was coming next, this was a story we could own. What an extraordinary and formidable undertaking it must have been, to be the one standing next to the first black President of the United States. And it was made all the more so because Michelle Obama was scrutinized and held to a bar far higher than any previous First Lady. And yet, she came through it with grace, intelligence, and humor, and in the process, inspired an entire generation of women and people of color, including me.  feels like I am not just reading the words of one woman 's incredible journey from lower middle class to being one of the most respected women of our time, but also the potential story of what could be for so many women of color. Michelle makes clear that her life was able to take its remarkable trajectory in large part due to the influence of her parents, extended family, teachers, and mentors, who all loved and invested in her through her crucial formative years.  Reading this, I am struck by how honest and forthright she is. She is open with all the difficulties and struggles she has gone through, both public and personal. She talks about how she tries to balance her drive for a career in public service with her husband 's political calling, all while raising two young children. It must have been extraordinarily challenging, yet she handled it all with enviable poise.  One of the things I most enjoyed about this book is its message of optimism and hope. She 's incredibly resilient and driven, even in the face of so much opposition, criticism, and disparagement of herself and her family. She accomplished so much during her time as First Lady, and reading her words in this memoir is a true inspiration.  Michelle Obama encompasses all that I admire: authenticity, kindness, and resilience. And this book is not just a candid self-reflection, but also a hopeful call for us all that we can do better and can achieve anything we put our minds to, as long as we are not afraid of hard work.  I am so glad I picked up this memoir of a truly exceptional woman. There 's a lot in here to digest, and I will be taking the time to think over all that I have read in the coming weeks and months. I know her words will stay with me for a long time.  20 book reviews: Absolutely stunning in every possible way. I hope Michelle is having a good day   21 book reviews: 5 Extremely Poignant Stars for  Becoming   When I think of Michelle Obama, the words that come to mind are: Grace Personified.  She exemplifies all of the qualities I admire most: beauty, elegance, honor, kindness, intelligence and dignity. To say that I miss the Obamas is an understatement.  Truth be told, that didn t begin to describe my reaction to hearing Michelle Obama s words, her thoughts and learning about her, a good portion of which I m ashamed to admit, I didn t know. The former first lady s humble beginnings, her close knit family, her education and her accomplishments, they simply blew me away. Princeton, Harvard, working at and forming Non-Profits (not to mention her accomplishments as the First Lady!): I am awestruck by you Michelle Obama.  The moment Michelle meets Barack Obama when he summers at Sidney Austin, the law firm she is an Associate at, she feels it. That spark. My eyes filled, they glossed over, the tears fell. The two shared an ice cream cone and became an us. (Here, listening to this, I admit to sobbing, heavily). The inflection and enthusiasm in Michelle Obama s voice, her feelings of love for this man, it is so evident. We saw them every day for 8 years.  From life in politics, campaigning, being bullied, becoming the First Lady and raising Malia and Sasha in the White House, Michelle Obama gives an honest portrayal of what life was like for her and Barack Obama. While in the White House, the President always made time for family. Always having dinner with them. Never discussing politics. Family was their bond. Yet his love for this Nation was and is still evident.  Her words, her voice, her thoughts struck a chord, for a myriad of reasons, some sad, some happy. I tear up just thinking about them.    Thank you to Michelle Obama for sharing your life with us. I am honored.  Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 12.8.18. Excerpt to be published on Instagram.  22 book reviews: I do not know what happened but I really did not connect with Michelle Obama while reading this book. I ended up skipping a lot of paragraphs, reading through it and would have probably not ended my reading of Becoming if it had been written by any other person in the world.  I really wanted to love that book. I pre-ordered it and was waiting for it with anticipation. I like Michelle Obama, I think she is an amazing strong woman and I wanted to read why she was all that. I still believe she is an amazing strong woman, but I still do not feel like I really know why. I know how. The book was filled with details and facts and anecdotes, that 's not the issue, I actually would have edited out some of it if it had been my decision, I felt it was to detailed at times.  The issue, to me, was that it felt more like a biography than an autobiography. A lot of how : facts, anecdotes, memories, but not a lot of why : analysis, opinions... Michelle Obama is a really good writer, and she tells us how she felt at times but... I do not know. Maybe it was a little to polished ? A little too clean ? Even when she talked about anger, it felt like \"light anger\", like okay anger. Even when she talked about marriage issues or about the death of her friend at a young age, it felt... It felt like she had a lot of distance, like she talked about someone 's else life...  I now know a lot of things about Michelle Obama and her family, her friends, her husband, her daughters, her life in the White House... But it all feels more like historical facts or a very long article written about her than her own thoughts. I am really disappointed by this, eventhough this book is still a good book, I get why people love it so much. It 's just it was not what I wanted it to be.  23 book reviews: MIND BLOWN!!  While I admit to being a reading fiend when it comes to politics, as some will no doubt have realised, I also find much pleasure in learning about people through biographies and memoirs. Knowing full well that I would be swept up in the wave that surrounded the recent release of Michelle Obama s memoirs, I vowed to take some time to read them, partially to offset some of the alarming pieces about current events in DC. Obama seeks not to define herself as FLOTUS (First Lady of the United States), but rather Michelle Obama (n e Robinson), taking the reader as far back as she can remember. Obama sets the stage for the reader with a solid recounting of her life on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1960s. In an era rattled by race wars, she remembers her parents forced to pinch pennies and living with relatives, while the world around them tried to come to terms with racial integration. Working hard in school and always striving to excel, Obama remembers gaining a spot at Princeton, where her older brother was already attending. There, she learned the power of community and helping others, a theme that repeats itself throughout the memoir. After leapfrogging into Harvard Law School again, through hard work and merit Obama was able to settle back in Chicago at a law firm. Here, she met an ever-tardy and somewhat esoteric Barrack Hussein Obama, whose basic living was something to which Michelle could relate, though they clashed considerably in their approaches to organization. Barrack and Michelle soon began a courtship that led to marriage and the introduction of politics into the equation. Barrack was a community organiser who was being touted for more, first a State Senate seat and then all the way to Congress. While Michelle was never fond of the political arena, she argues throughout the middle of the memoir about how she could never stand in the way of her husband s ambitions. The Obamas welcomed two girls into their lives, doubling the size of their family and bringing new meaning to work ethic. Michelle struggled with this, as well as being a wife/mother while her husband was away a great deal, though the reader will see much change throughout, as the girls got older. The last great transformation for Michelle was her husband s choice to seek the White House. If she struggled before, the campaign showed her new issues and concerns, as exhibited through a number of lenses. The Obamas worked hard and utilised their fresh message approach to reach the political pinnacle, but that was only the beginning. In wonderfully fluid narratives, Michelle Obama depicts life inside the White House and roles of the First Family, inviting the reader to explore some of her most personal thoughts as initiatives, bills, summits, and security decisions shaped America at break-neck speed. Even when the time came to leave, Michelle refused to turn off and fade into the background, arguing that there was still much life to live, as can be seen with the publication of this book. Stunning in its frankness and refusal to shrink out of sight, Michelle Obama offers readers a refreshing look at a woman s life who was shaped by her life experiences, but refused to be defined by the man who stood beside her. Recommended for those who love memoirs, politics, coming of age, and anything uplifting, which is sure to offset much of the sludge that Washington is spewing out these days!  There have been many notable First Ladies in the last number of years, all of whom left their own marks on America. However, I can think of only one who stood out and sought to define herself independent of the role her husband brought as President of the United States. That thought came to mind before I began this book, though now that I am on the flip side, I can see that Michelle Obama was more than  wife of , but rather a woman of great importance in her own regard. Michelle Obama refuses throughout and in many scenarios to allow herself to be defined as simply a member of a group. She is not just a woman, an African American, a mother, a First Lady. This memoir catapulted many of the views I had of Obama and helped me see the woman who sought to fight for equality years before she made headlines, who advocated for others decades before healthy snacks in schools became an initiative, and who loved life to its fullest before being thrust before the cameras. In essence, Michelle Obama many things on her life journey, hence the aptly chosen title. As the memoir argues so effectively, there was more to the woman than being a spouse and mother, tending house while Barrack Obama rose to power. Without Michelle, there would have been no winning campaigns, but not because she stumped or smiled for the cameras. It was her passion and dedication to the kernel of the Obama family that saw these four people become firsts in many things and helped America realise its greatness. Being able to tear down walls, rather than build them; communicate passionately, rather than attack venomously, Michelle Obama forged the cornerstone of the legacy she wishes to leave the world. Let it never be forgotten that beside every decent man is a fundamentally stupendous woman and the brilliance of the words in this book give new meaning to this. When I speak of brilliance and earth-shattering aspects of this memoir, I refer not only to the wonderful prose and sound vignettes that rise from page upon page, but also the shards left to twinkle in the sunlight, as the reader notices just how many glass ceilings Michelle Obama was able to break in her life, paving the way for other women to follow her.  Kudos, Madam Obama, for one of the most enthralling memoirs I have read in a long time. I am stunned, in awe, and so happy I took the time to get to know you better. Thank you for making the world a better place by being an active part of it!  Like/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:   A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge:  24 book reviews: 4.5 stars!!  I ve had Becoming pre-ordered since I saw it was coming out. I was so excited to read it. Per my Amazon account, I purchased The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama in early 2007. When I read this book, I was moved and hoped this man would be president one day. When I was in my early 20 s, I volunteered for his 2008 campaign. My point is, I ve always loved the Obamas, but I never knew much about Michelle. After reading this book, I feel like I know so much more. Her story is inspiring, fascinating, and I adore her.  If you re going to read this book, I can t recommend the audio book enough. Michelle herself narrates it and I always love when authors narrate their own stories. It makes them that more personal and captivating. I loved reading about her past, her family, and of course when she met Barack and their story. I could relate to some of her story and learned a lot of new things about her. This was a fantastic autobiography and I can t recommend it enough!  25 book reviews: Michelle Obama Give Me A Hug And Tell Me Everything Is Going To Be Okay 2k19.  One of my greatest wishes is for the entirety of my thought process to be narrated - if not controlled - by Michelle Obama.  But apparently that isn t  a thing that can happen,  and  even if it was it d be creepy and in many ways morally wrong,  and  seriously Emma how do these ideas even occur to you, it s worrying, stop.   So I did the next best thing and listened to this audiobook.  18 HOURS OF MICHELLE OBAMA S VOICE!!  I don t even LIKE audiobooks (shockingly - I like books and I like podcasts so I m not sure what s holding me back), and still I m aware that the fact of the matter here is this:  If you read this instead of listening to the audiobook, you re getting played.  Because the only thing better than reading 426 pages of Michelle Obama writing about herself is listening to 18 hours of her talking about herself.  A complete dream.  Bottom line: I could rant about my love for Michelle Obama for 426 pages, but that would be weird. (If this weren t weird enough already.)  ------------  starting a petition for michelle obama to give me a hug  review to come / 4.5 stars  ------------  i want michelle obama to be in charge of everything, including my entire life.  however that appears to not be \"\"\"possible\"\"\" so i am going to listen to her talk for 18 hours instead  26 book reviews: You bet your ass I just preordered this. As a female minority, Queen First Lady Michelle Obama has become one of my most go-to role models, and I already know I am going to be in tears while reading this. 27 book reviews: Becoming like Michelle Obama herself, is both eloquent and relatable. She talks about becoming her, becoming us, and finally, becoming more.  As most of us know by now, Michelle is from Chicago, grew up with loving and supportive parents, attended Princeton followed by Harvard for law school, then began her position as an associate at the prestigious law firm of Sidley Austin, where she eventually met Barack.  My favorite section of the book was by far, Becoming Us, in which Michelle describes meeting Barack and the evolvement of their relationship.  Michelle does not pretend living in the White House was not a privilege or shy away from the associated perks. She doesn t pretend it was always amazing and wonderful either. There were plenty of tough days with the various events happening around the world. The pressure and scrutiny of trying to raise 2 daughters with some semblance of normalcy could also be taxing on the family of 4. Through it all, Michelle always remained committed to being the best mom to Sasha and Malia.  The nostalgia and longing for the former Obama reign in the White House, was, as I read this memoir, and is, still real.  The Obamas are admirable not just for their smart talents but also their continued relatability. They are genuine people who want more for their kids, for their country, and just doing their part to contribute to this goal. A tad oversimplified? Maybe, but if it s not clear yet, I m a huge fan.      Highly recommend for fans Michelle, Barack, and the Obama administration.  28 book reviews: Monumental Michelle Obama s book, Becoming, is a refreshingly honest and fascinating insight into the major decisions, challenges and events in her life. This left me with even more respect and admiration for her and Barak. It provides wonderful coverage of her thinking and actions through life, from childhood to lawyer, to wife and mother, and to First Lady.  Michelle s background in the South Shore neighbourhood in Chicago is openly chronicled to the reader and shows a person shaped by her hardworking and loving family, a father that grafted every single day at the water filtration plant, even with multiple sclerosis making it difficult to walk. The foundations of her determination and her devotion to her own family with Barak were rooted deeply during those early years. Her telling of losing family and friends is just heartbreaking, more because she goes beyond loss, and ties it to the gift of life, and life s lessons.  After meeting Barak and establishing a loving relationship, Michelle recognised his vision and drive, which led her to question her own highly paid legal career. She would seek something that would give her a similar meaning and purpose. Something that would go well beyond the need to secure a higher and higher salary. She changed jobs, taking massive pay cuts to find that purpose and contribution to society. She worked for non-profits, City Hall, healthcare and academia, so she could make an impact where it mattered, to heal divisions and disparities.  What has inspired me most about Michelle and Barak is that they give a sense of possibility to ordinary people. A possibility that doesn t require sacrificing everything for that single self-centred goal. We can strive for a life of balance, a balance between family and career, between self-need and freely giving, and between reality and dreams. The realm of politics is very strange and I have often held a thought that anyone determined to be in politics should be enough reason for them not to be elected. Those thoughts played on Michelle s mind as she watched Barak become drawn into that manipulative and dishonest world. While ultimately providing all the support she could to her husband 's mission, she was steadfast in keeping her focus on family needs. There are slips along the way but with careful and honest reflection, she grounds the family again and prevents the glamour of their position affecting her family values.  This book provides a unique perspective on the greatest political achievement for many decades in the US. The achievement that working-class people can further their education, their careers and their dreams to the pinnacle of ambition. What caught the imagination of the world was that Barak Obama would not only become the USA s first black president but would disregard the supposition that only money families could achieve such a high office.  Of course, this book is inspirational, but it is also the manner in which it was achieved that inspired people worldwide. Michelle pays such heartfelt devotion and praise to her husband s role and gives another lens on his achievements. Barak s views came from a place of inclusion, positivity, caring, principles and hard work. Compare that with what we see today, not only in the US but globally. He also had a natural ability to engage people and inspire possibilities.    Michelle s life as First Lady illustrates how serious she took the role and how she used it to tackle issues that were important to her, such as the families of service personnel, and the education rights for girls, while also remaining resolute in maintaining a regular family life that they would return to when the presidency terms were over. She is a lady of utmost intelligence and dignity, with a strong moral focus. Pity, she won t ever run for President - we will see.  I felt the book revealed more than I was expecting, however, it wasn t a tell-all account and provided the perfect balance between factual insight and titillating gossip. The book created a captivating and enthralling story, deeply moving at times, and with a conviction to keep family and friends  secrets private.  I listened to the audiobook version so I could take the opportunity of hearing Michelle Obama s story in her own eloquent words. The narration feels deeply moving and personal and on the many emotional events in her life, it becomes so touching that you are totally enchanted in the little bubble that now surrounds you.  This is a book I highly recommend it and really worth reading or my preference, listening to.  29 book reviews: i ve been crying for like 3 hours lol ",
    " Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?": "book reviews: Subtexts: perspective, surveillance, paranoia!  I had to read this aloud maybe a hundred nights in a row before I noticed what the text was plainly saying: everyone thinks they are being watched! And ironically, they are the ones doing the watching! From the titular brown bear who is certain that the red bird is watching him/her, each animal is watching an animal and projecting that the very animal they watch, is watching them!  In reality, none of the projected watching is happening. Each animal is watching a different animal, save for the children, who imagine that ALL the animals watch them, when in fact it is the children who gaze out at every animal.  Here are the lessons of the book: -the people you think are watching you are not -actually, it is YOU who is doing the watching! -animal colors in real life may vary from depictions [though Franz Marc painted some lovely blue horses and I do hope their inclusion here is a nod to him]  1 book reviews: Many people may not like this book or think it is too simple a book, not really a story. I think this is a great book. My children love it. It is a perfect book for young children who are just starting to learn letters, their sounds, and words. It is also a great book for those children who may not be great readers. When I taught first grade, I had a few students who were not able to read. Their confindence level was low and we had a really hard time finding good books that they were able to read independently. But this was one of the few books they enjoyed reading on their own. Any book that can make a child feel like they are a successful reader is a great book in my opinion.  2 book reviews: The first book that I ever read! It was also the first book I would introduce to my primary school students! 3 book reviews: I still (and yes, even years later) cannot even remotely fathom that Bill Martin Junior 's classic and universally beloved by young children Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? was actually and in fact categorically banned in 2010 by the State Board of Education in Texas because its (and no, I am not really feeling contrite at all or in any manner guilty about being insulting and denigrating here) obviously woefully lacking in even basic intelligence members (and in particular totally moronic board member Pat Harding, who also made things much much worse and herself look absolutely and utterly ridiculous by repeatedly and vocally trying to justify her sorry self) somehow and in error believed that Bill Martin Junior was the author, was the same Bill Martin of the DePaul University in Chicago, who in 2008 penned an academic textbook called (a book I have actually read, and no, it did not turn me into a raging Communist either, Ms. Harding).  I mean, banning children 's books is bad enough anyhow as well as it being totally undemocratic and dictatorial (read Stalinist, Fascist), but really for those extremist right-wing Texas ignorants who were obviously infesting the State Board of Education like dangerous parasites to ban and to forbid from being used and displayed in Texas schools because they were obviously not able to figure out that the author of and the author of were different Bill Martins (and especially since Bill Martin Junior had died in 2004 and the other Bill Martin did not even pen his ethical Marxism book until 2008), this just so totally and painfully shows that the Texas Board of Education 's members who insisted on being removed from schools are either not able or not willing to adequately research authors or the books they write. And really, how is the Texas Board of Education 's 2010 banning of any different from when in the South Africa of apartheid, Anna Sewell 's classic horse autobiography was banned by government bureaucrats because they thought the novel was about people with darker skins being beautiful (and of course, this could not be accepted in South Africa, and without the bureaucrats even bothering to read , it was banned and restricted by idiots with clout and power).  But then again, perhaps Pat Harding actually did read and thought (after noticing the author 's name and freaking out in error and terror) that there indeed might be some kind of hidden and insidious left wing propaganda present and ready to hurt young children in , to turn them into Communist agitators, that perhaps Eric Carle 's illustration of that big red bird signifies Bill Martin Junior 's support of Russian Communism, of Leninism and that the yellow duck 's colour could be considered as being a positive nod towards China, towards Maoism? I mean, who knows, and while I am of course being majorly tongue in cheek and facetious here, it is indeed pretty darn surprising and woefully painful how many strange reasons for banning books especially book banners in the USA and in staunchly Social Conservative areas do seem to regularly come up with and vehemently support (and democracy, my foot, since Social Conservatism is far far too often politically Fascist in scope and also even quite majorly politically and philosophically akin to Stalinism and Leninism at its extreme, at Social Conservatism 's most reactionary and most radical).   4 book reviews: Terrible characterization. Blue Horse? What the heck is that!? The plot is monotonous and dull. And the ending...a montage of scenes from the book, and not even a good one! The only thing I can say in its favor is that you can probably get through it in a couple of days. 5 book reviews: 4 This is a cute and creative book. My niece likes to skip some pages and then go back, then skip and go back. She loves the tabs she gets to pull. She is learning how to wait for her queue to pull them still. Eh, she ll get there. She s not even 1.5 yet. :) I love the rhymes. I like the shapes and forms of the animals, they seem solid and geometric .. easy for a child to see and identify. I also like the bright colors. 6 book reviews: I have been an avid fan of Eric Carle s works, especially of his well-known children s book  The Very Hungry Caterpillar  and one of the books that Eric Carle had worked on that I did not get the chance to read when I was little was  Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?  which was also written by Bill Martin Jr. All in all, this was one children s book that children should definitely check out!  Since this story is extremely short, the summary will be brief. Basically, the plot of this book is about the reader seeing various animals comment on what other beings they are looking at that precise moment, while each animal states a variation of this quote:   Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see? I see a red bird looking at me.  Red Bird, Red Bird, What do you see? I see a yellow duck looking at me.   Wow! I cannot believe that I waited this long to finally pick up this popular children s book and it was definitely worth reading in the end! I loved the simplistic style that Bill Martin Jr. brought to this book as the plot is basically having readers see various animals in different colors popping up in the book and commenting on other animals they have seen. I loved the fact that each animal is a different color such as having a blue horse and a purple cat as it brings a unique spin to the storytelling of this book and I was quietly anticipating seeing what kind of animals we will see pop up in this book. Eric Carle s artwork is as always, a delight to look at as all the characters are rendered in paper cut outs which gives the book a creative look and I really loved the images of the different animals that show up in this book, such as the purple cat and the blue horse!    Even though there is nothing wrong with this book, I have to wonder why it was banned in the first place? Well, it turns out that when it was banned, the person who banned the book made a mistake regarding the author of this book, who is Bill Martin Jr. and the person thought that it was the same Bill Martin who wrote the book  Ethical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberation.  Now, I have never read any of the  other  Bill Martin s books, but this was the first instance where a book was mistakenly banned for the wrong reasons and that got me curious yet annoyed.  Overall,  Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?  is a truly cute book for children who want to have fun with identifying animals and colors all wrapped up into one book! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.      7 book reviews: [Book #18 for my grad school Children 's Lit class] 8 book reviews: This is the story of a teacher so dedicated that her students simply called her Teacher. She celebrated her classroom 's multi-racial, multi-ethnic diversity with an array of class pets: a brown bear, a red bird, a yellow duck, a blue horse, a green frog, a purple cat, a white dog, a black sheep, and a goldfish. Some criticize her teaching methods, citing the dangers of bears in the classroom, but I stand by her choice to lead with alliteration in spite of any potential maulings. 9 book reviews: My children loved this book when they where small. A firm favourite on my bookshelf. 10 book reviews: This book was my favorite book that Mr. Martin Jr. wrote. It was so fun to read out loud to myself and others. 11 book reviews: A cute little story of colorful things 12 book reviews: My Kindergarteners made me read this to them five times on Friday at work. Five times!!!!! By the time I was done, I could tell every word to the story without looking at the pages. Some one please save me from pushy five year olds with a penchant for rhyming books. 13 book reviews: I was not really into this book when I was little, but this is my daughter 's favorite book- so I have to give it 5 star props. Whenever we get to the black sheep, she yells out \"BAAAAAA!\"  Many mornings she wakes up and demands, \"BOOK!\" and if I do not pick this one, she yells, \"Noooooooo! BOOOOK!\" until I read her Brown Bear... 14 book reviews: I remember reading this book when I was little!   totally beautiful for little kids! 15 book reviews: This book is full of suspense, intrigue, and giant brightly-colored animals. So naturally I m a huge fan. 16 book reviews: Bold move to not order the animals according to the ROY G BIV spectrum. Makes it slightly more challenging to memorize. I am almost there, though.  My eleven week old daughter giggles like a maniac whenever I start reading this book to her, and she is particularly fascinated by the final page. Hence -- because of the maniacal gurgling and concurrent kicking -- five stars, although personally I found the narrative arc a bit flat.  17 book reviews: My daughter loves this for the animals and repetition. It does well to teach color, perception, and basic animal recognition. But it honestly gives me a headache with its dull repetition and lack of rhyme use when it so easily would have improved readability. 18 book reviews: Any children 's book by Eric Carle becomes an instant classic - and rightly so.  The illustrations are absolutely fabulous and are so wonderous that it would look gorgeous if each page was framed and hung around a baby 's or child 's bedroom.  I ca not say enough good things about this children 's book. If you do not already have a copy of this book for your child, you should buy it asap. You will NOT be disappointed.  5 STARS    19 book reviews: Something tells me that I may be on the island alone, as today was the first time that I read Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?   Something also tells me that I enjoyed losing my virginity because I read the book with my students. More accurately, they read it to me!!   I can still hear the rhythmic cadence of Bill Matin s story even as I write this review.   And, then by adding the highly recognizable illustrations by Eric Carle, you are bound to have a truly enjoyable read.  20 book reviews: Eric Carle And Bill Martin Jr s Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? Is A Creative Collage Of Learning.  The Activity Potential With Early And Young Learners Abound.  My Favorite Is The Art. As A Teacher Encouraged Students To Create Their Own Color Collage Animal.  The Skills Used Run From Dexterity To Storytelling. Cross Curriculum. Art To Science When Including Study Of The Animals And Even The Imaginary Creatures Brought To Life.  Students Can Develop Their Individual Stories And Design A Group Narrative Collectively.  Begin With One Student Following A Story Starter. Then, Go Around To Each Child Asking For Inclusion Of Their Animal And Use Of One New Word They Learned This Week. Or, Make Up Their Own Word And Explain What This Means. Perhaps A Sound The Animal Makes.  For Inspiration Read Dr Seuss With Silly Words To Help Along.  Have Students Mount The Animal On Construction Paper. Bind The Book With Yarn. Publish As Part Of The Classes Publishing Company.  You Get Where This Is Going, Right? Literacy And What s Possible Today Are Endless. Empowering Happiness Through Literacy Engages Students Regardless Of Background With A Few Supplies And Prompts.  This Book Is A Great Partner To Mary O'neill s Hailstones & Halibut Bones.  As I Recall, How The Story Became Is Mary s Publisher Or Agent Was Asking For Another Book And Were Given Permission To Look Through Her Papers.  Back In Those Days All We Writers Had Were Pages Of Paper With Writing. Sometimes In Drawers, Filing Cabinets, Pockets   Who Am I Kidding? This Is Still My Life.  Anyway, What Is Uncovered Is Pages And Pages Of Color Descriptions Leading To This Book.  What s Especially Magical Is The Discovery Of Blind Individuals Being Able To Imagine Colors Based On The Colorful Cataloging Of Categories Mary Uses To Enhance Senses Which Helps People Who ve Been Born With No Sight For Context.  This Book And Other Carle Creations Is A Legacy I Hope To Follow Inspired By His Work.  Growing my hardcover book collection added a copy of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see in honor of one of my favorite children s artists, Eric Carle     21 book reviews: Definitely one our favorite books. Great illustrations and fun to say out loud. All my kids pretty much have the book memorized so much so that we recite it in the car. Easy reading, but a good book for an older sibling to read to their younger siblings and a great way to learn colors. A book the whole family loves. 22 book reviews: I ca not recall how many times I have read this for storytime over the years. A lot. That 's the answer. It 's a favorite for all. 23 book reviews: I read this with my children. Classic kids book! They have memorized it they love so much! 24 book reviews: The narration was okay; the story is good. 25 book reviews: One of my favorites. Great illustrations 26 book reviews: Great classic to help kinders begin to read by \"retelling\" the story. 27 book reviews: Text-To Teaching Connections  I think Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Did You See is a great book to introduce a lesson on colors for art. This book allows colors to be fun and interesting. I would ask each child to get into groups to represent each animal of the book. One group would be the bear, another group would be the dog and so forth. We would construct their own animals using construction paper and crayons.  When reading the book for the second time, I would have each group hold up their animals and make the appropriate sounds of those animals. We can also students to identify realistic animals (such as the white dog) and animals that are more creative to the imagination (the blue horse).  28 book reviews: I like so much the bearns 29 book reviews: Loved it as a kid, but this artwork is creepy as shit ",

    " Educated: A Memoir": "book reviews: On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We do not go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it ca not because it does not know about us. Four of my parents' seven children do not have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we have never set foot in a classroom. Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho.   - image from her The children constituted his workforce in Gene s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place. Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one s ills, calling her products  god s pharmacy.  And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.   - image from Westover s site  Home schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out. Successful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)  At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.  Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.  The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book.   - image from the NY Post  A piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes.  Tara s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world? Her brother, aliased as  Shawn  in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.  One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that must have done to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped.   - image from Salt Lake City Tribune  She struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like , an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad,  When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

Whenever I don t know a lot about something, I ll read a textbook or watch an online course until I do.  I thought I was pretty good at teaching myself until I read Tara Westover s memoir Educated. Her ability to learn on her own blows mine right out of the water. I was thrilled to sit down with her recently to talk about the book.  Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in rural Idaho. Her dad had very non-mainstream views about the government. He believed doomsday was coming, and that the family should interact with the health and education systems as little as possible. As a result, she didn t step foot in a classroom until she was 17, and major medical crises went untreated (her mother suffered a brain injury in a car accident and never fully recovered).  Because Tara and her six siblings worked at their father s junkyard from a young age, none of them received any kind of proper homeschooling. She had to teach herself algebra and trigonometry and self-studied for the ACT, which she did well enough on to gain admission to Brigham Young University. Eventually, she earned her doctorate in intellectual history from Cambridge University. (Full disclosure: she was a Gates Scholar, which I didn t even know until I reached that part of the book.)  is an amazing story, and I get why it s spent so much time on the top of the bestseller list. It reminded me in some ways of the Netflix documentary , which I recently watched. Both explore people who remove themselves from society because they have these beliefs and knowledge that they think make them more enlightened. Their belief systems benefit from their separateness, and you re forced to be either in or out.  But unlike  which revels in the strangeness of its subjects  doesn t feel voyeuristic. Tara is never cruel, even when she s writing about some of her father s most fringe beliefs. It s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.  Of the seven Westover siblings, three of them including Tara left home, and all three have earned Ph.D.s. Three doctorates in one family would be remarkable even for a more  conventional  household. I think there must ve been something about their childhood that gave them a degree of toughness and helped them persevere. Her dad taught the kids that they could teach themselves anything, and Tara s success is a testament to that.  I found it fascinating how it took studying philosophy and history in school for Tara to trust her own perception of the world. Because she never went to school, her worldview was entirely shaped by her dad. He believed in conspiracy theories, and so she did, too. It wasn t until she went to BYU that she realized there were other perspectives on things her dad had presented as fact. For example, she had never heard of the Holocaust until her art history professor mentioned it. She had to research the subject to form her own opinion that was separate from her dad s.  Her experience is an extreme version of something everyone goes through with their parents. At some point in your childhood, you go from thinking they know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. I m sad that Tara is estranged from a lot of her family because of this process, but the path she s taken and the life she s built for herself are truly inspiring.  When you meet her, you don t have any impression of all the turmoil she s gone through. She s so articulate about the traumas of her childhood, including the physical abuse she suffered at the hands of one brother. I was impressed by how she talks so candidly about how na ve she once was most of us find it difficult to talk about our own ignorance.  I was especially interested to hear her take on polarization in America. Although it s not a political book, touches on a number of the divides in our country: red states versus blue states, rural versus urban, college-educated versus not. Since she s spent her whole life moving between these worlds, I asked Tara what she thought. She told me she was disappointed in what she called the  breaking of charity an idea that comes from the Salem witch trials and refers to the moment when two members of the same group break apart and become different tribes.   I worry that education is becoming a stick that some people use to beat other people into submission or becoming something that people feel arrogant about,  she said.  I think education is really just a process of self-discovery of developing a sense of self and what you think. I think of [it] as this great mechanism of connecting and equalizing.   Tara s process of self-discovery is beautifully captured in . It s the kind of book that I think everyone will enjoy, no matter what genre you usually pick up. She s a talented writer, and I suspect this book isn t the last we ll hear from her. I can t wait to see what she does next.  2 book reviews: \"It 's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you\"  I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband 's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother 's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .  Tara grows up free or wild. She didn t bathe that often, didn t wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc.  I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara 's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It 's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid for  Plus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?  Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College is not cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she did not seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other 's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.  There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara 's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to \"learn\". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who does not want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I do not care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book.  What worked for me in this book was Tara 's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.  Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just was not for me.  I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing group and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  See more of my reviews at  3 book reviews: 2 stars and I know, I am an outlier.  I have been born with a gene called the \"doubting Thomas\" gene. It has made me very leery of trusting and believing a lot of things and unfortunately this gene kicked in big time in this story billed as a memoir.  While I do believe that the things described by Tara Westover might have happened, I also have to think that this was a book of childhood memories. Sometimes, as children, we distort the truth, and sometimes grown to adulthood we only remember fragments of what happened and when confronted by others realize our memory was somewhat faulty.  There are actually quite a few things I just could not wrap my hands around in this story. For one, being a former teacher and having had the pleasure of teaching many gifted and brilliant students, I just could not see what, with the quantum lapses in Tara 's education, how she could possibly have made it into both a fairly prestigious college and then onto the highest level of university in England. Learning builds upon itself and being a former math teacher, I can say that if one only had the rudimentary knowledge of the four simple math functions, that going onto higher level math would be virtually impossible. Was it possible that her early education being home schooled was not as lacking as she described it to be?  The next issue I had was that of the number of injuries incurred by she and her brothers and her mother just snapping her fingers, using essential oils and other agents and then recovery occurred. Granted, I am not a medical professional, but the incidents described in one or two particular cases was life threatening and yet these techniques done by the mother worked? I know I still blame it on my doubting Thomas gene. I do also have a belief in both holistic and regular medicine being a partnership in the healing process.  Next up for me, was Tara 's ability to obtain somehow the finances to attend college and then to travel overseas to England and back. Yes, I do know that she was awarded scholarships but what about the incidentals, travel, food not provided in school. Did she live like a hermit and never leave the confines of the school she was attending? From her writing, we know that is not true.  Lastly, if indeed these things were happening, where were the people who should have noticed the abuse? Where were the friends, the church goers, the people who did business with the father? Would they have not noticed untoward things happening to the Westover children. Would not at least one of them have come forward? Why are some of them coming forward now to defend this family?  So, sorry to say, I am going against the grain of many of my fellow much respected readers and reviewers, and saying that I just could not buy into what was being set forward in this book. I am not an advocate for her parents, nor do I think that things never did happen. Perhaps to me, this book just has not explained the circumstances well enough for the doubting Thomas in me to believe.  Thankful to my Traveling Sisters who read this book along with me. We all seemed to share the same ideas on this one and I am glad as always to have my thoughts and feeling able to be expressed to such a wonderful group of avid readers.  Also thank you to netgalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book.  4 book reviews: Difficult to read. Impossible to put down. A powerful, powerful book that you shouldn t miss. I can t just leave it at that because Tara Westover s story deserves more than those few words. I don t often read memoirs, but when I do I want them to be told by extraordinary people who have a meaningful story to tell and that would be faint praise for this book. It sounds odd to say how beautifully written this is because we are not spared of the ugly details of what this family was about, but yet it is beautifully written. I had to remind myself at times that I wasn t reading a gritty novel, that Tara and her family were real as I got more than just a glimpse of a life that was hard for me to even imagine.  A religious fanatic father, hoarding food and guns and bullets and keeping his family off the radar, not filing for birth certificates, not getting medical attention when they needed it, avoiding the government, the feds at all cost , keeping his children out of school, the paranoia, the preparation for the  Days of Abomination  - this is what we find in this place on a mountain in Idaho. There are horrible accidents and he won t get medical help for his family. Her mother s healing herbs and tinctures are used to treat the slightest scrape to the most horrible head injury or burns from gasoline to an explosion. If some thing bad happens it because that s the will of the Lord. Her mother seems at times more sympathetic to her children, but she is complicit by her subservience to her husband. I don t even know how to describe it other than gut wrenching to see the effects on this family of neglect in the name of religious beliefs and in reality mental illness. It isn t just her father but the brutality by one of her brother s which is more than awful and creates rifts between family members,  That she was bold enough and somehow found the will to rise above it all while she is torn with the sense of duty, of loyalty to her family, the ingrained beliefs, still loving her family is miraculous. Going to college was the first time she d been in a classroom, not knowing what the Holocaust was, learning about slavery, the depression, WWII, the civil rights movement. She doesn t just get a college education but ultimately a PhD from Cambridge, a Harvard fellowship. She struggles for years to discover who she was, who she could be - a scholar, a writer, an independent woman. This is a stunning, awe inspiring story that will haunt the reader long after the book ends.  Thank you to Tara Westover for sharing yourself with us. I received an advanced copy of this book from Random House through NetGalley. Thanks to my friend Diane for bringing this book to my attention. Without her review I might have missed this.  5 book reviews: Westover is clearly a decent writer, but I felt underwhelmed by this book. Some things did not seem to add up. Such as how an uneducated mountain wildgirl clicked her heels together, magicked up thousands of dollars (yeah, yeah, scholarships do not cover everything, you know), and went on to some of the world 's most prestigious higher education centres. Intelligence is not the main thing required to attend Harvard or Cambridge; being able to pass exams and perform the system 's dance is. Someone without formal education should have no idea how to do that.  Also-- are some people magically cured by herbs and finger-clicking here or did I miss some medical intervention along the way?  But I think, overall, I was just a little disappointed because everyone seemed to find the survivalist aspect so dramatic and awful. I have read a few books about isolated communities that go off the grid and enforce their own laws and, I have to say, Westover 's experience felt pretty tame. Her family were survivalists who spent months canning peaches and hunting for scrap, but is this really that odd? I heard all these promises of \"wilderness\" and \"mountain survivalists\", but they have a phone and TV. I would say this family is more \"eccentric\" than \"survivalist\".  Where the book does succeed is as . I think this was the most important part of the book and it 's been glossed over in favour of people 's delight at learning about weirdos running around wild in the mountains. (I am not judging; I came for that too.) I also found it really interesting and sad when the author suggested that her father 's paranoid delusions might have been undiagnosed bipolar disorder.  It 's a , I will give it that. But it 's hard to not feel like something is amiss, and certain events were probably exaggerated. Or, alternatively, Westover 's \"survivalist\" family were sitting on a few on-the-grid dollars that conveniently popped up when equipment needed repairs and people needed to go to college. It 's also possible that the writing just lacked clarity.  |  6 book reviews: So good. So good. SO GOOD. Ok, I will try to elaborate. Tara Westover 's memoir is incredibly engrossing not just because of the rollercoaster of traumatic events that occur throughout her life, but also because of her ability to weave humanity and complicated familial relationships in her portrayal of events. While it 's easy to take these events and market it like a thriller novel, it 's that sense of reflection and poignancy in her carefully crafted words that is the book s strongest asset. As awful as her family is, she tries to make them as multifaceted as possible by describing both the horrific treatment she dealt with alongside the tender moments that have made it hard for her to let go. I have always been either apathetic or critical about our education system, but I loved Westover s insights that her education has afforded her to expand her worldview and transform her into her own individual. I would recommend this book to anyone who comes from a dysfunctional family as proof that you don t have to be trapped in your circumstances and can seek a better life for yourself.  A common critique is questioning how much of her memoir is embellished. My gut reaction is to take offense, as these dismissals have implications of not believing a victim of abuse and gaslighting her like her family did. But I know that all memoirs have degrees of embellishments, and it s fair to have healthy skepticism. However, she peppers several footnotes throughout her memoir that point out contradictions in her memory based on different accounts of her siblings. This indicates that she is aware of how memories can be subjective, and the fact that she even clarified where her own perspectives differed and included different accounts showed that her priority was telling her story as truthfully as she can. That s all you can really ask of someone bearing their life story. I believe the book and trauma she went through are completely valid, and her efforts in both staying true to her experiences while sharing different accounts reassure me in that validity.  7 book reviews: To be honest, I don t even know why I m bothering to review this.  There is no scenario in which I am a more trusted source than Obama, Oprah, the New York Times Book Review, and the Goodreads Choice Awards combined, and if they ve all already told you to read this (which they have) then I don t know why my recommendation would push this whole thing over the edge for you.  If I am a more trusted source than all of those, then I just don t know what to tell you. Besides the fact that I m concerned for us both.  But here we are, so. Introducing: My thoughts. My thoughts are: that this is a very good book.  Truly groundbreaking stuff, I know.  But really - it s worth the hype. And this is coming from the girl who s one-starred so many popular books she has an  unpopular opinions  shelf with hundreds of books on it.  Can the New York Times Book Review say that?  Maybe I should be the more trusted source.  Anyway. This is not only beautifully written (and it is beautifully written), it s stunningly recollected too. The emotional intelligence of the author is so vivid in every page. There is so much empathy here.  This is already an incredible, gorgeous story, with a profound and impactful arc, but the talent of the author is what really makes it masterful.  Bottom line: This is good sh*t.  (You don t get that kind of blurb from Oprah.)  ----------   oprah was right.  review to come / 4.5 stars  ----------   all it takes to convince me to read a book is 500,000 ratings with a 4.48 average + a Goodreads award + tons of nominations + the New York Times, Barack Obama, Oprah, and every major publication naming it one of the best of the year.   8 book reviews: Update: Honestly the hate I ve received for this review has blown my mind.   you re an idiot. And a bit of a dick. Grow up.    Maybe the fact you struggled with mathematics for 16 years mean you struggle to appreciate quality storytelling.   Fucking hell. It s my opinion. My review. You don t agree that is absolutely within your rights but don t start tearing me apart, because I will not argue with you. I ll just delete your dick comments.  *********************   DNF on page 234  I feel like I m not reading the same book as everyone else? It s boring. This happened, and then this happened and then the same thing happens again. Also I know this is supposed to be a memoir but am I honestly supposed to believe her mother survived a brain injury with not a jot of medical care? How she conveniently managed to scrimp enough money for the next semester of college borders on the unbelievable. Her brother is an asshole and I really don t want to see how that unfolds. She teaches herself trigonometry. Honestly how? I studied maths in the school system for 16 years and still struggled with it. How does someone with absolutely no prior experience with it just teach herself maths at college level?! I know some people pick it up quicker than others but really?! She even gets 100% on an algebra test at college.  Maybe I m being overly harsh, but I m just not having a good time - good on her for standing up for herself, but this is too wordy, definitely exaggerated and there are way too many other books in the world.  9 book reviews: I had a really tough time reading this book.  The physical and emotional abuse made me want to put it down and forget about it. The manipulation, the abuse she went through left me speechless. While not unique, family issues are still so taboo. Brainwashing your own self into thinking it 's your fault, that it was not that bad or that you imagined it will hit way too close for comfort for a lot of people.  The author 's writing was beautiful and her courage to get an education and stand up to her family was inspiring.  Do recommend if you can stomach it.  10 book reviews: Excellent memoir. Really well written. The story is just horrifying from beginning to end. It really makes you wonder how many people are homeschooling their kids and enabling abuse and indoctrinating kids in all kinds of racist paranoid nonsense. I kept thinking  this is so fucked up  as the story careened from one nightmarish circumstance to the next. It s amazing what people are able to survive. It s a shame that survival is demanded of so many. 11 book reviews: Every second of this book is enthralling!  EVERY.  SINGLE.  SECOND.  The tales in here are true. The stories are mind-blowing. The events are not from a time long ago - they happened in the past 20 years! You will have to keep reminding yourself of that because the mindset and ideas discussed sound antiquated, but they are alive and kicking . . . and that is just crazy!  One thing that brought this story close to home is that at the time a lot of the events in this book we are taking place, I was living in Yellowstone National Park and frequently travelled to or through Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Salt Lake City and all points in between. This means I could have been mere miles away from the events in this book while they were taking place! Again, this seems impossible to me and I had to keep reminding myself that this was happening in my neck of the woods! And, because of this, my mind was repeatedly blown.  I suppose I should mention what might be a trigger warning for some. Most of the men and some of the women in this book are described doing crazy and abusive things. I swear that every few minutes I had to stop, collect my thoughts, and say, \"Wow!\" While none of us were there to witness this and the author even says there are many who will deny the events and say that her version of the events are driven by the devil himself, they are shocking and will get your mind churning! I feel her frustration and so many times I wanted to reach into the pages and tell her, \"It does not have to be like this!\"  Also, another trigger warning, if you work for OSHA or help maintain OSHA workplace safety standards, you are going to probably throw this book across the room or at least slam it in disgust a few times.  This book is amazing and I highly recommend it - I am driven to follow this up by hunting down interviews with the author.  12 book reviews:  You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,  she says now.  You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.  Tara Westover lived her life like everyday was her last - literally. Her dad was a doomsday prepper.  She spent her childhood stockpiling supplies, scrapping with her brothers and deeply in penance for her \"sins\".  , schools were forbidden, everything was treated with a homeopathic cure and a long prayer. She told again and again thatand should not seek out a life.  But... are two different things. When she was seventeen, Tara went to school for the first time. It was an adjustment - to put it mildly - from her quiet, almost subservient role at home.  But the longer she stayed away from home, the more she realized what exactly she was missing...and what she would have to leave behind to seek it.   Overwhelming... but in an addictive way.  Like level of addicting  I read this one in a single day - and it was worth the late night and early mornings.  There 's something just so wholly compelling and riveting about her voice.  The way she constantly questions and sought out something else - often without truly being aware of what that something else was.  The sickly feeling that crept up upon me when her parents and siblings tried to sway her back.     13 book reviews: Here 's the thing: when I read a memoir, I am looking for something real, something that encapsulates enough of the truth as to be authentic. But the events in this book are pretty unbelievable.  Tara had never gone to school before applying for college. Her mom tried to homeschool her, but gave up early on. Without ever having studied or developed the discipline for learning, Tara teaches herself a variety of subjects well enough to ace the ACT and get into a good university. This all happens while she 's simultaneously working for her dad at a junkyard, getting injured herself and watching others be grievously injured too, and being physically and emotionally abused by her brother.  I believe people can do a lot if they put their mind to it, but this is pretty far-fetched. It 's natural to embellish the truth in order to tell a good story, but I have to wonder how much of it was really true and how much was the embellishment. Sure, there is a small possibility that everything happened exactly as described. But it 's so remote that I have trouble suspending my disbeliefs. If this was fiction, I would be okay with it. But since it 's billed as nonfiction, I am kind of skeptical.  But for me, the most frustrating thing about this memoir is reading about Tara justifying her brother 's abuse towards her, and her parents' choice to turn the blind eye to what was going on. She 's constantly rethinking what happened, with each subsequent version being more and more watered down until she no longer remembers if her brother even hurt her in the first place. She follows these people like a puppy, begging for their love and attention, even as they continue to mistreat and threaten her.  Am I the only one who thinks that 's just bananas? She 's essentially using the book as a form of therapy to justify the behavior of people who abused her. I am sorry, but I just ca not get on board with that. It was exhausting to read, and it 's not clear she made any real progress on getting past this. Even at the end, she seems ready to forgive her parents if they ever say the word.  The writing style is philosophical and ruminating, with overly ornate language at times. There are so many passages in which she 's overthinking things, but without gaining any of the key insight she really needs.  It 's ironic this book is called \"Educated,\" when it never makes clear if and what exactly she has learned through all of this.  14 book reviews: 5 brilliant stars to Educated!            I grew up in a home of readers with a teacher mom and a dad who questioned my effort when I made an A-minus on my report card. When I began reading Educated, I was floored that Tara and her siblings were not in school, and they were not homeschooled either. How could this happen in modern times with compulsory schooling put in place long ago?  Tara made it clear from the start that her family s Mormon faith did not cause her father s substantial paranoia; however, he used his faith to feed it. This family not only did not have insurance, they did not believe in accessing traditional medical care. Horrific accidents and illnesses abounded due to the father s and one sibling s risk-taking, and no one went to the doctor.  While the family was clearly having difficulty grappling with many things, I was struck by the love and devotion between them, even with the strained family dynamics. It was both fascinating and heartbreaking to watch those dynamics shift even more as Tara s aspirations developed and were achieved.  Strength. Grit. Perseverance. Tara s tenacity resulted in her leaving the farm at Buck s Peak and enrolling in college, after never attending a day of school. Her words were upfront, bold, but never complaining or looking for pity.  Overall, I found Educated to be one of the most engaging, powerful, and inspiring memoirs I have read.  Thank you to Tara Westover, Random House, and Netgalley for this reading experience I will treasure. Educated is now available!  15 book reviews: This one first came to my attention via a GR review. I thought wow, I need to read this now. The wonderful Traveling Sisters group set it up as a slow read and I was in. Grabbed a copy from NetGalley and was ready to go. BUT.....and a big BUT......I did not like this one, I had to force myself to finish. Had it not been for the group read, I am sure I would have DNF would this one.  So I am probably in the minority in not liking this one. It was more of a 'having a hard time believing the story' kinda thing. Tara details her life growing up in the mountains. She paints a picture of this wild child who does not bathe, or wash her hands after using the toilet (her grandmother had a fit about this), is quite ignorant, but yet...she self teaches herself to get into a prestigious college. She talks about her childhood and her parents seems so bad - no schooling, must work and earn money, her father seems to be a religious zealot who harbors a fear of the govt, her mother creates tinctures that cure people from near death. It just became a bit much and I was having a hard time believing it all. Multiple car accidents, severe burns, head trauma, and all cured with herbs. But then she wants to go to school, so she does...college, gets a PhD. Where did she get the money? They did not seem to have much money. Yet, being in the  amountain' rustic home, they had a phone, tv, internet. I dunno, it was just getting to be a bit much for me to believe. She ended up having multiple siblings teach themselves, go to college, and get advanced degrees. Really?  A memoir is defined as an autobiography or a written account of one 's memory of certain events. Maybe this is how she remembers everything, maybe it really all happened this way. I really do not know. But it all just did not add up for me. I had so many questions about everything. I have a family member who remembers his childhood different from how I remember HIS childhood. So it happens. I will just say thanks to NetGalley for an advanced copy of the read and this in no way influenced my review.  16 book reviews: Tara Westover s book  Educated  is a distressing & discomforting - alarming & startling exposure of her Mormon fundamentalist family.   Educated  is a memoir of nonfiction - but names and identifying details have been changed. Aaron, Audrey, Benjamin, Erin, Faye, Gene, Vanessa, Judy, Peter, Sadie, Shannon, Shawn, Susan, Robert, and Robin are pseudonyms. Tara tells us in her authors notes:  This is not about Mormonism. Neither is it about any other form of religious belief. In it there are many types of people, some believers, some not; some kind, some not. The author disputes any correlation, positive or negative, between the two . Yet....as I read this novel - I not only felt angry - sickened at times - but really conflicted too. I had duel thoughts from the beginning of this novel to the end. I  did  think - in part this book was about Mormonism ( let s call a spade a spade). Tara and her siblings had backpacks filled with supplies to defend themselves ready to  head-for-the-hills  ....ready to run ( away from the government). Her dad, Gene, feared that the government might one day try to intervene their lifestyle. They were living off the grid. The kids had no formal education, or medical care when sick or injured. Instead of going to the hospital when needed - their mother, midwife/herbalist cared for them with alternative remedies. The government might have even brought in social workers to evaluate the health their family. Abuse? YES! This family stayed hidden. Abuse in many forms was hidden.  Tara s memoir-impart- also details ( summarizes) the transitions and challenges entering the academic world -Brigham Young University- Harvard- Cambridge ( PhD in History). Her educational journey was interesting   some of it maddening to me also .... not faulting anyone - but it was painful for me to discover just how  much  about the world - life changing world events a 7 year old knew - at age 17 she  didn t  know - yet somehow was studying at a University. I questioned  how was this even possible ? Amazing. Tara had great support from a church entering college...which was wonderful.  At times I felt frustrated  besides  some greatly disturbing horrific frightening descriptions during Tara s childhood. Tara s academic accomplishments were extraordinary but I couldn t find her voice. She seemed - fragile - and often so uncertain of herself. This book is very well written - ( gloomy -perplexing - and wearisome at times from repetitive trips back home to seek validation from her family)- but it seemed her education brought her almost as much pain as it did inner fulfillment. Because Tara disputes any difference between negative and positive  admirable in ways  I had a hard time getting an experience of  HER . I admit it s my own frustration. This young girl had a childhood I could never fully comprehend- or know what scars remain...but the fact stands   she 's living proof that amazing change is possible. Tara calls that  an education . Alright ....I agree....but I m still sad and feel incomplete. ( it s my problem - not hers).  There have been comparisons to this book and  The Glass Castle . I understand that   but in reality they are presented very differently. Not only does Jeannette Walls not change any names in her book   she had just freedom to go on National television with her homeless mother. She didn t need to hide or change identifying details. Tara Westover felt the need to keep names hidden. ( less freedom between the author and her readers for full- self expression). I understand- but a little less satisfying.  I DO FEEL THIS BOOK OUGHT TO BE READ .... I DO SEE THIS BOOK S IMPORTANCE....a story about an American family living by their own rules - ignoring others who don t follow their beliefs. WE SEE TARA WESTOVER S SKILLFUL LYRICISM in this book....very impressive  one of the most inspiring aspects to me. With her achievements, education, and talent, we got a well-written fascinating SAD STORY.   I will think about Tara - worry & wonder about her in years to come. It killed me that Tara continued time and time again to seek validation - I m not sure it s over. She kept going home to a place where her own brother tried to kill her   She almost begged her mother to see her time and time again too  it was soooo painful to me that her mother rejected her  but just as painful that Tara kept needing their approval. All so sad. I UNDERSTAND....yet I can t see who she is through her own behavior.  Tara has an inspiring academic education  a relationship with 3 of her siblings but trying to regain a relationship with her parents - her violent brother - and even one of her sisters she was once very close to was like trying to get blood from a turnip....it just wasn t possible. It made for very frustrating reading.  Why did Tara keep trying to fill her heart with the family that rejected her several times? And were abusive? And can a book education take that pain away? These are questions that lingered with me.  Tara had a sweet - warm- soft voice on NPR. Her interviewer called her dad a  character . She agreed. All light and fluffy. Tara share About MANY HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES on NPR. I was a little confused listening to her. Was she happy or angry? She seemed so happy about her childhood. Huh? Yet for years she suffered abuse which she tells us in her book. On NPR: She said the junkyard was playful and exotic, but was dangerous....but also fun. She said the Mountain where she grew up was magical and beautiful.....but they were closed off from the rest of the world.  Duality....duality...duality ...... is a word that Tara used over and over again on NPR. Tara see s two sides to her entire life. I felt a little  duality  in this story myself. I still feel Tara herself is hidden from this story. Can t put my finger on it. But one thing does hit home   we can t meet the rest of her family like we were able to of Jeannette Walls. So - this is clearly TARA S memoir....and I ll respect it at that.  This is a valuable powerful read but I m guessing there might be more to this story one day.  Thank You Netgalley, Random House, and Tara Westover ( congrats to you on your book - may you continue to find inner peace and happiness)  4.4 Stars  17 book reviews: \"Not knowing for certain, but refusing to give way to those who claim certainty, was a privilege I had never allowed myself. My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.\" - Tara Westover, Educated: A Memoir    This book feels like it was written by a sister, a cousin, a niece. Tara Westover grew up a few mountains over from my dad 's Heglar ranch. I do not know her. Do not know her family. She grew up about 70-80+ miles South East as the crow flies, but realistically, it was a 1.5 hours drive difference, and a whole planet of Mormonism over.  I did not grow up in Idaho. I was born there and returned there yearly. But this book is filled with the geography, culture, behaviors, mountains, religion, schools, and extremes I understand. She is writing from a similar, and often shared space. I did not just read this book, I felt it on every page. Her prose was amazing. The memoir danced at parts, while a couple pages later, I would be sent up for air. I often found myself having to talk through parts of the book with my wife while reading. It flowed. Some books seem to remove friction while you read. My wife abandoned work for a day to read it. It consumed us.  This book reads like a modern-day, Horatio Alger + . However, it is not just a book about how a girl with little formal education from a small town in Idaho makes it to Cambridge. It is also a tale of escape, and a historiography. Westover is using her own life to do a popular memory study on herself. She is looking at how she viewed her religion, her background, her parents, and her education. She explores how those memories and narratives change and reorient based upon proximity to her family, her father. These narratives especially begin to reorient as she becomes \"educated.\"  I bought a copy and before I even read it, I gave it to my father to read (He grew up in Heglar, ID). Then I bought another couple and yesterday and today my wife and I raced to finish our respective copies. We bored our kids talking about it over two dinners. We both finished it within minutes of each other tonight.  Tara Westover 's memoir hit me hard because of the struggle she has owning her own narrative. Through many vectors I related to her (we both graduated from BYU with Honors, were both were from Idaho, educated Mormons, and both have preppers in the family). My family, while sharing similar land, a similar start, and a similar undergraduate education, however, are not Tara 's. And that is what made this memoir so compelling. It was like reading a Dickens novel, but one that was set in your neighborhood. It was moving, sad, and tremendous. In the end, I was attracted by how close the story felt, but I was also VERY grateful her story was not THAT close.  18 book reviews: I grew up with my nose perpetually in a book. So, the idea of not being able to go to school, of being deprived of an education, hit me really hard. It was hard for me to grasp that things I take for granted, like knowing what the Holocaust was or who MLK, Jr. was, were black holes to Tara.  Tara Westover is the child of a religious fanatic, someone who sees the government as pure evil. And by government, he means schools, hospitals, vaccines, seat belts, car insurance, etc. Everything we think of as civilization. His family awaits the Days of Abomination. There is a similarity here to The Glass Castle. Once again, we see how a mentally unbalanced father holds sway over an entire family. He thinks he speaks for God. Tara struggles with the knowledge that for her to go to school will mean a total separation from her father because he will never acknowledge that his ideas are not the correct ones.  Parts of this book are cringeworthy. I found myself shaking my head that folks would allow severe suffering rather than a trip to the hospital or the use of real medicine. I ll warn you that some of these sections are not for the faint of heart. The descriptions are sickening.  I know little to nothing about the Mormon faith. Certainly, the faith of this family is not the true Mormon faith. But you get glimpses enough to also realize that there is a strong anti-woman bias in the faith and that women are definitely second class citizens. Broodmares more than humans on a par with men.  This book doesn t sugarcoat things. It s not an education makes everything better kind of story. Tara continues throughout the book to struggle to find her way, to stand up for her beliefs. Hell, to find her own beliefs.  This is an amazing book. It makes you realize how easy your life is. And how strong folks like Tara are to be able to rise above their beginnings and be able to fight back against the attempts of family to hold them down.  I m willing to bet this book makes it onto a lot of best of 2018 lists. It will certainly be on mine. Highly recommend!  My thanks to netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book.   19 book reviews: I do not want to disregard Tara Westover 's life experiences or not believe her, so I am going have to settle on one of two options:  1) either she is not a very good writer;  2) or her memories are often faulty and/or selective, with an emphasis on the macabre and tragic, which is understandable I guess.  Much of Tara 's misfortunes and fortunes seem to make no sense, or not explained well in the context of her life story. There are multiple miraculous recoveries from numerous life-threatening untreated injuries, a lot of magical money appearing out of nowhere to pay for things Tara needed, a bunch benevolent men throwing opportunities and scholarships at her. Either Tara was a very naturally gifted student or an extremely hard-working student, it 's hard to tell. No case was made for either of these possibilities, if I accept that she had received NO structured education. (Does BYU have such low standards BTW?)  The survivalist angle was entirely overblown by publicity around this book. If anything, Tara 's family was careless and sloppy, with their main oddity being not believing in modern medicine. Canning peaches is not survivalism as far as I know. And it 's quite hard to claim to be closed off from the world if you have TV, phone, internet and take dance classes in town.  Too much of this story smells like BS, and I am not talking about the abuse, I have no reason to doubt that. It 's the details that are a complete mess. The gaslighting Tara had experienced at the hands of her family was the most compelling part of her story actually.  20 book reviews: JOYA. 21 book reviews: A monumental memoir that should be required reading for all. The description does not do it justice. It 's not about getting a PhD, it 's about growing up in a family that does not believe in school, thinks doctors are a part of a sociologist conspiracy, and that any day the government will shoot them dead--if the end of times do not come first. The experiences Tara describes are horrific, yet oddly relatable--even if your family is nothing like hers (and let 's hope it is not). By the end, she has to come to terms with balancing family bonds and having the strength to see past their warped sense of reality.  There 's really no words to describe it, but I would start with moving, inspiring, shocking and un-put-downable. Stop wasting your time reading this review and start reading the book! IT'S SO GOOD!!!  22 book reviews: Masterpiece. Starts off slowly but definitely worth it. 23 book reviews: Does anyone else smell that? Me smells a (James Frey, A Million Little Pieces) rat here. This is what I hate about memoirs. An author can fill page upon page with a load of made up BS and we are meant to fall for it hook, line and sinker. I have made this argument before, even though a memoir is based upon the recollection of the author, it should still be FACTUAL!  Let 's begin at the beginning. I almost stopped reading this book at page 3. I read the alliterative phrase 'chirping crickets' three times on ONE page. I lived not far from where Tara Westover grew up and we had these:    MORMON CRICKETS  NOT these:    REGULAR OLD CRICKET  There is no lovely cricket chirping sound with the first because they are not a cricket. They are actually a katydid. Ok, enough science.  Westover is apparently         all rolled into one. Jackie Chan because no one alive other than him has suffered the number of life-threatening injuries and survived to tell about - oh wait, except for Tara Westover. Confucius because of her astounding insight and prophetic sayings, and John Stuart Mill because Westover has got the philosophy of feminism down like no other philosopher since Mill. (At least that unsightly knot on Mill 's forehead would jive with what Westover should look like if she had been through as many physical catastrophes as she claims).  Westover is ready to give these singers a run for their money since she sings like a goddess after never opening her mouth before. WATCH OUT:      Tara Westover will be receiving her Grammy, Tony, Emmy and Oscar before she is 40, I am sure.  That is if she is not too busy adding colloquialisms to the vocabulary for the rest of us. Hey, Tara, EVERYONE calls a blinding, windy winter storm a WHITE OUT. They did not make that up in Idaho.   Westover is the greatest thesis writer, the greatest dissertation writer, the greatest student Cambridge has ever seen. All while being a complete idiot.  She goes from having no   (Sorry I could not resist taking a jab at the end of days BS in this book)  to having enough to fly to ROME and back and forth to the US countless times! That must have been one HELL of a PELL grant.  Westover says \"...I would been surprised to discover echoes of Mormon theology in the great philosophers of the nineteenth century.\" Should not that be the other way around - that Joseph Smith ripped off philosophers not that they thought he was so profound as to steal from him?   Her father would have been dead, dead, dead if he had suffered burns to the degree that she claims. He would have contracted an infection or pneumonia and would not have survived. And since the bottom of his face was gone as she purports, how was he able to hold a phone up to his shoulder? If his hands were so disfigured, how was he able to write, drive or BUILD AN EXTENSION on their house?!   I could fill this review with inconsistency after inconsistency, but I am sick of this book. I am sick of hearing about it. I am sick of having read it.    Some will ask why I read this whole book if I hated it so much. And the answer is that if I was going to be savage about this book, and I was, I wanted to read the whole thing.  SOOOOOO, this savage spent the entirety of this book doing this:   P.S. Hey Random House Publishing, I will be sending you my deats for a refund for this POS book. You can bet that all the made up shite in this book is going to come out sooner or later. Did you learn NOTHING from James Frey?   24 book reviews: LIBERACI DAL PADRE (E possibilmente, liberaci pure dalla madre)    The Texas Chainsaw Massacre   Non aprite quella porta . Make: 1974, regia di Tobe Hooper. Remake: 2003, regia di Marcus Nispel.    un esordio, e quindi parte delle mie osservazioni critiche a seguire potrebbero essere scusate dal debutto. Lo sono meno, ai miei occhi, perch  di questo libro s  voluto fare l ennesima next big thing,   stato molto spinto, promosso, e discusso. Inquietante, dal mio punto di vista, la quantit  di fotografie che si trovano di questa giovane scrittrice nata nel 1986: ho sempre l impressione che in questi casi si usi la fotogenia di chi scrive per vendere di pi , e magari coprire qualche magagna.     Un altro problema per me immenso, smisurato,   che il libro   sempre promosso a pieni voti per il suo contenuto, per la sua storia, e non per il modo di raccontarla. Ancora una volta la trama ha eclissato lo stile, il cosa annulla il come.     La storia credo sia ormai abbastanza risaputa: famiglia numerosa (curioso come chi scrive commenti vari il numero dei Westover junior, per chi sono cinque, per chi sei   invece sono sette, e questo si aggancia a quanto dir  tra poco) e famiglia disfunzionale   un incrocio tra  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - Non aprite quella porta  pi   Le colline hanno gli occhi  e dall altra parte  Winter s Bone   Un gelido inverno . Se non che, nel caso dei Westover la violenza   diretta all interno della famiglia stessa, ben pi  che all esterno (anche se in casa circolano perfino armi antiaeree, e i vicini di casa portati come esempio di resistenza sono membri del White Power, Fratellanza Ariana). I figli non vengono registrati all anagrafe, niente certificato di nascita, vengono convinti o forzati a mollare la scuola, o non frequentarla del tutto, a stare alla larga da medici e ospedali. Il tutto giustificato da una religione (mormone) che non sta in piedi neppure un istante: quale dio richiederebbe e/o approverebbe simili livelli di bestialit  umana?! Poi, il tutto si giustifica invece col bipolarismo paterno. La pi  piccola di casa, Tara,   un magnifico esempio di resilienza, fiore nella concimaia che si redime e salva andando al college (approda addirittura a Cambridge e Harvard), studiando, educandosi, imparando. Un magnifico messaggio di speranza, che   bello raccogliere e far proprio.     Ma all ombra di questo splendido assunto si nasconde una scrittura senza sorprese, n  bella n  brutta, accessibile e piana, che per fortuna si tiene lontana dalle frasi memorabili e/o a effetto, ma affastella pi  che incidere. Soprattutto si nasconde un libro notevolmente disarticolato, oserei dire sgangherato. Senza ritmo. E senza una qualche struttura, magari anche ondivaga o contorta. Accelerazioni improvvise sono seguite da brusche frenate, scatti e salti anticipano passi indietro. Non parlo solo dei salti temporali, a quelli siamo abituati, quelli vanno pi  che bene: a me sembra che la giovane Westover avesse o molta fretta di sfogarsi, o cognizione di una fine da raggiungere in qualsiasi modo. Affronta ogni argomento, dalla descrizione della montagna alle violenze domestiche, con lo stesso identico tono, finendo, ovviamente, col piallare ogni cosa. Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quegli scarabocchi che si schizzano mentre siamo al telefono o in riunione, e quindi, quando la nostra attenzione   altrove, e la mano gira e rigira, incide, rimane sullo stesso punto, e alla fine vattelapesca cosa volevamo disegnare,   solo un garbuglio di linee. Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quei film dove uno viene pestato e ne esce con la gamba sinistra zoppicante e un brutto livido sullo stesso braccio   nella scena seguente, per , zoppica dalla destra, e il livido   sulla guancia invece che sul braccio.     Il primo esempio che mi viene in mente   la vicenda materna: dopo il primo incidente d auto, subisce un emorragia cerebrale, vive al buio con occhi diventati come quelli di un panda, ha emicranie, non prende medicine, solo erbe, dato l'impedimento religioso, si ha la netta sensazione che sia un processo irreversibile, molto probabilmente destinata a morte prematura  E invece non si sa dove, n  come, n  quando la madre torna in piena efficienza (fino al punto di poter subire un secondo incidente d auto). E cos  avanti per tutto il libro.   stato notato da pi  parti che il livello di credibilit  di quanto raccontato da Westover non soddisfa appieno.    378 pagine che a me sono sembrate 3.780. Se non addirittura 37.800.  Ma siccome il benedetto messaggio, o contenuto,   di quelli belli belli   ma siccome nella confusione qualche momento buono ci scappa, io tre stelle con qualche esitazione alla fine gliele do. Anche se ora, per giusto bilanciamento, la tentazione   andare a mettere la quinta a Elena Greco. E altrettante a Lila. Le mie amiche geniali.    25 book reviews:  My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.   The above sentences have the entire essence of this book. This is Tara Westover 's story, a home-schooled woman who struggled against all the hardships and got admission to the universities like Harvard and Cambridge. This book shows us the actual value of education and how it can change a person 's life. This is a must-read book if you love reading memoirs.  26 book reviews: Everything about this book amazed me. I will not stop thinking about this book for a very, very long time. I do not think I can even do this proper justice in a review other than telling everyone to go out and READ THIS BOOK! Easiest 5 stars ever. Loved it. 27 book reviews: ***Expect anything but get ready to get surprised***   Oh God...what did I just read?!    It 's a perfect 5   read for me. Once I started reading the first few pages, I just could not stop reading it. Strange for me to say but when non-fiction tends to read this fictional good I am ready to read non-fiction anytime everywhere.  Yes, this book seems like a fiction because we are not aware of the fact that such situations exist in real. If it was not for this book, I would have been so blind to such important issues which happen in families struggling with poverty, illiteracy, misguided religious beliefs, family violence and undiagnosed serious mental health conditions.  Before I picked up this memoir, I used to believe that it is just about a girl who strived to get education and got successful in achieving that.  But I say it is much, much more than that.  This book is horrifying at times the way some events were really dark, violent and gruesome. I was on the edge of my seat until I read the back cover of the book.  I understand when the author described how she experienced utter helplessness, getting pulled in opposite directions whether to let go of the family ties or to buckle under everything because it 's her family. The hardest is when it 's your own family that hurts you and you are left feeling all alone in the entire world. I could relate to this book at so many different levels. I am so glad I picked up this book!  28 book reviews:  my life was narrated for me by others. their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. it had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.   i would generally consider myself to be a reserved person. i dont tend to actively share my thoughts, feelings, beliefs, or opinions. personal things like that, i usually to keep to myself. but after reading this book, it would be a shame to not express, in some form, how important i think education is.  this story, this harrowing yet powerful story, only supports how i feel about the necessity for accessible formal education, as well as the importance to have a desire to educate oneself. taras experiences only prove the immense power of education - how education allows us to be able to consciously examine the world and judge/act accordingly, how striving to learn opens doors to possibilities we can scarcely imagine, and how educating ourselves ultimately gives us the strength of having our own voice.  and so, i have no reservations for saying that i am of the strong opinion that this raw and contemplative story is one every person should read.  * i have been told that i can be a negative nancy from time to time. whilst reading this, there were several aspects of taras story that didnt quite add up to me. i believe every reader should have a healthy ounce of skepticism within them, and mine was causing little red flags to pop up here and there. i appreciate the authors candidness about the unreliability of childhood memories. so although i took the extreme nature of the books content with a grain of salt, it did not detract from the overall message of this book - the importance of education - and so i rated based on that.   29 book reviews: Educated, Tara Westover  Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her \"head-for-the-hills bag\".  In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father 's junkyard. Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism.  The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara 's older brothers became violent. Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself.  She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement.  Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she would traveled too far, if there was still a way home.  Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties.  With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one 's life through new eyes and the will to change it.       :              2019    :          :                1397   448   9789644487767   :                   -  21              1986                                                                           :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2018              : (                                                                                                                   :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      :                                                                !)             08/10/1399    27/08/1400     .

    " Get Out of Your Head: Stopping the Spiral of Toxic Thoughts": "book reviews: I really, REALLY tried to finish this book, and I did make it 2/3 of the way. Local friends chose it for book club, and met weekly to discuss each chapter. But it slowly became an unbearable source of frustration and annoyance to me, so I finally dropped it.   Here s a paragraph that exemplifies my two biggest problems with it:     I recently posted on Instagram this quote often attributed to Andrew Murray:   Humility is perfect quietness of heart.... It is to expect nothing, to wonder at nothing that is done to me, to feel nothing done against me. It is to be at rest when nobody praises me and when I am blamed or despised. It is to have a blessed home in the Lord, where I can go in and shut the door, and kneel to my Father in secret, and am at peace, as in a deep sea of calmness, when all around and above is trouble.   The comments in response to this post were priceless:  Wow. This is difficult.  How rare.   Whoa. That hurts.    -   1 Does she really need to bookend a quote by referring to her social media following?!? The entire book is chock full of her American lifestyle, her family stories, and her personal experiences, though they usually seemed barely related to the content. I think she intended to be vulnerable and relatable to the reader but it was frustrating to me, who does not relate to her, and doesn t read personal growth books because I want a hug. I want concise, solid, and well-studied content. I want a book written by a successful expert in the field, not a well-meaning blogger. Which brings me to my next point.  2 That quote on humility. That is not what humility is. It s twisting the meaning of words to make a point. That happens in every single chapter. I had red flags going off constantly and it made it extremely difficult to pick out the bones in my search for good content. The book is not founded on Biblical principles or on psychology, though she does use both to support her points. The book is based on an idea that hit her as she was running. The idea is fine, but there is a definite lack of depth or actual experience here. It feels like an extrovert rambling about an idea they had after watching a TEDx talk.... which is exactly what it is.  Maybe I m being unfair. This book is exactly what it s meant to be, a pop-Christian self-help book written by an  influencer  with a following. Most of the ladies in my book club loved it, and I think most middle class American women will - the references to Starbucks, scrolling on social media, and Netflix binging are right up their alley and are included abundantly to cater to them. It was overwhelmingly cringy to me, but I realize I m in the minority. The points of the book are fine, even if the delivery gave me an eye twitch.  If you re wanting a meaty deep-dive into challenging and changing your thought-life, I HIGHLY recommend Telling Yourself the Truth by William Backus and Marie Chapian. I started it soon after I started this one and it is written by experienced and knowledgeable psychologists and counselors and based on Biblical principles. It s been extremely challenging and eye-opening and I m actively applying it to my thought-life and helping my children through the principles as well.  1 book reviews: I wanted to really like this book. The premise resonated with me. However, in the end, it was not what I was expecting. While the author acknowledges at one point about differing personalities (she being an enneagram \"7\" and her sister being a \"6\" and introvert v. extrovert), it feels like the suggestions offered are more of the one-size-fits-all variety. I also had a tough time following the organization of the book, this could be due to the e-book formatting. She uses graphics of spirals, but did not really walk through how the spiral matched with the chapter. I think what I was really looking for was in Part 3 of the book. By then, though, I was skimming. I will potentially go back and read that portion again. All in all, I think some people will really like this book. But, for some, like myself, it will be hard to relate. This is written from the point-of-view of a very energetic (enneagram 7) author who had an 18 month bout of anxiety. It 's not written with the understanding that some face some degrees of these anxious thoughts as their daily norm.  I received an Advanced Reader Copy of this book via NetGalley.  2 book reviews: Perhaps the worst book I ve ever tried to read. I tried really hard to finish this, but might be my first DNF. It s illogical and extremely poorly written. If you are the right demographic, I suppose it offers some confirmation bias by very, very poorly linking scripture with science.  I m paraphrasing here, but... At one point she writes: you know that Bruno Mars song where he says he ll jump on a grenade for you? Hate to break it to you, but he actually won t... God will though! Immediately followed by how her daughter got stuck in a bathroom and her sons  attempt get her out was like Jesus  strength and determination. What?!?  If somebody told me this was a parody, I probably could have finished it and laughed a lot.  3 book reviews: This book was even better than I thought. I have read a lot on neuroscience and a lot on neuroscience combined with scripture, But I really found helpful the lies or negative thoughts she would state and the truths and ways to turn the downward spirals around. Even if you are not someone depressed or anxious there are other big thoughts in this book that will bring conviction with hope and a roadmap to change. I ve enjoyed listening to the podcasts that go along with each of the chapters and will be released when the book releases.  Some of my favorite quotes:   But in Christ we can fight not from a place of insecurity and outrage but from a place of reconciliation. Of calm confidence. Of peace. Of love. Why? Because our victory is sure. We ve already won  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   The way of Jesus shifts everything. In Jesus, we can acknowledge our frustration, pain, and suffering without abdicating our peace and joy. In Jesus, we can change where we fight from without changing what we fight for. By the power of Jesus, we can demonstrate to ourselves and others that, regardless of how grim the situation seems, God is in the business of redeeming all things. Out of gratitude to Jesus, we can see God s purposes in our pain  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   My besties know my fixations because those fixations aren t easily hidden. Our fixations come out in our words, in our feelings, and in our decisions. They are the focus of the books we read, the podcasts we subscribe to, the websites we scour, the groups we join, and the obsessions we pursue. Are you fixated on the fear that your kid will someday rebel? You re going to read a lot of parenting books. Are you anxious about getting sick or not being uber-healthy? You ll listen to tons of health podcasts and spend a small fortune on essential oils  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   He has given us the power and the tools and His Spirit to shift the spiral. When we re willing to take the initiative here? Some pretty cool stuff starts to unfold. When we think new thoughts, we physically alter our brains. When we think new thoughts, we make healthier neural connections. When we think new thoughts, we blaze new trails. When we think new thoughts, everything changes for us.  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   When we re spiraling in noise or distractedness, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through stillness. When we re spiraling in isolation, we have a choice to shift our minds back  ( to God through community. When we re spiraling in anxiety, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through trust in His good and sovereign purposes. When we re spiraling in cynicism, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through worship. When we re spiraling in self-importance, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through humility. When we re spiraling into victimhood, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through gratitude. When we re spiraling in complacency, we have a choice to shift our minds back to God through serving Him and others  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader  Usually, however, he is sneaky. He tempts with successes and hypnotizes with comforts until we are numb to and apathetic about all that matters  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   If you want your child to thrive, then make him or her feel seen and loved  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   How often have we chosen to be unhappy? Rather than seeing the best and celebrating the good, we have chosen to see only the struggles and complain  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   Cynicism is always driven by fear of the future or by anger regarding the past  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   Cynicism is destroying our ability to delight in the world around us and fully engage with others. God has an abundance of joy and delight for us, and we re missing it with arms crossed. What if there was another way to live  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   cynicism usually grows because we think we deserve better than we are getting  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   Beauty interrupts us, it awakens us, it undoes us, it cuts us open, and restarts our hearts. Beauty is God s evidence of something far more wonderful coming, a world beyond the one we can imagine, even in the most spectacular moments here  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   Good things happen when we train our attention on that which is beautiful, on that which is authentic and compelling and good  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader    Cynicism puts our minds on things of this earth, and we lose hope. Beauty points our gaze toward the heavens and reminds us of hope  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader    We worship when we experience awe. And cynicism and worship cannot coexist  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   The answer convicts me every time.  When he was reviled,  verse 23 says,  he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   When we are puffed up with thoughts of how important we are, our mirror neurons are impaired. That s why, in my spiraling of self-importance, truly understanding my coworker s point of view was nearly impossible  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   We find our  enoughness  only in Christ. If anything, God s Word tells us to camp out on the opposite view from the one our culture holds: when we re weak, it s actually a good thing, because Christ s power is made more evident in us  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader   The truth is, our hearts aren t really after power; they re after joy. And the deception we buy into is that somehow joy will come when we have power. Joy comes when we lay aside our power and rest in God s. Joy comes when we put the emphasis where it belongs: on God s awesomeness, not our own.17  (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader  There are many more I highlighted but just go read the book. I m looking forward to my hard copy arriving to I can mark it up and come back to it.  4 book reviews: So I was gonna give this two stars just based in the subject matter, but after consideration I ve decided that I just can t. I truly can t recommend this to anyone and feel like this will truly help someone struggling with anxiety.  I wish this was a book about leaning on Jesus and what we can do practically to stop the thoughts that make us spiral, and there really are some good points that she makes, but they are all clouded by the author talking about what SHE learned and what SHE figured out. Showing how together she is and look at all SHE s done and SHE S writing a book and this is how SHE lives so you should too, with scripture and quotes taken out of context to fit whatever narrative she s talking about in that paragraph. Furthermore, she does it all under the guise of seeming humble - using strange stories to convey a quirky sense of relatability that just isn t there. She leans on the stories of the people around her, because she truly has never had anything truly difficult happen to her (at least that she talks about within the book). This felt more like reading someone s journal than someone truly writing for someone else s pain.  While there are some good points made in this book, it s really heavy in christianese and never dives to anything deeper than surface level.  I can appreciate too, that this book may be super helpful for some people - but I believe that is only going to be a very specific type of person.  5 book reviews: I personally found this book incredibly helpful in identifying the root cause of a lot of my unhappiness and lack of fulfillment.  Thoughts are mighty powerful things, and they are treated as such in this book. I especially related to chapter 11, but every chapter tackles a necessary area to reframe our thoughts and behavior around, so definitely don t skip any chapters! There is something to learn and wisdom to gain on every page if you re looking for it.  I finished this book feeling encouraged and emboldened, and excited to get back on track with Jesus! So, obviously, I d recommend!  6 book reviews: I really wanted to like this book, but it didn t live up to my expectations. I appreciate Jennie being open about her own struggles with doubt, but I found the book to be repetitive and fluffy. There were pieces of practical advice sprinkled throughout the book, but nothing that we haven t already heard. If you re looking for a Bible study book that can help spark group conversation this would probably be great, but if you re hoping for a book that gets into the weeds of toxic thoughts, you won t find it here.  7 book reviews: The title of this made me think it was going to be something different than it was, haha. I was expecting more of a self-help book but did not even make it through the introduction before being turned off by the religious talk. My own fault for not reading more about the book before reading the book. 8 book reviews: I am halfway through and already skimming. Another peppy  Jesus is the answer  book by an outgoing energetic woman of God. I have enjoyed hearing Jennie talk at past conferences and the idea of negative thoughts diminishing my joy struck a chord. Unfortunately, Jennie it a little too bouncy, happy Christian for me to ever really connect. Have there been good points? Yes. Does it seem to be  one size fits all?  Yes. Does the author use an 18 month bout with doubt to back her insights? Yes Will people love this book? Yes. It is a pretty tidy little book filled with what to do, say and think to reclaim your mind from the devil (because he wants us to fail...) so you can live free. I will finish this book and come back to share my final thoughts and maybe change my initial star review (2) but I will stick with the Rachel Held Evans, Jen Hatmakers and Sarah Besseys of the faith when I am looking for someone to share the thought battles that run through my head. I appreciate what Jennie has to say, but I do not connect with her material.  Back again. I was ready to update my review and maybe move to a 3 (since I can t give 2.5) after reading the chapter on community and friendships. Then I read the chapter on fear... it was ok. Next came the chapter on cynicism. It will take a lot for me to finish this book. I basically disagree with everything she wrote. According to Jennie,  cynicism is ALwAYS due to future fears or past anger . Disagree. Cynicism is often built from observation of the world around us. My cynicism of the church today has nothing to do with future fear or past hurt. It has to do with seeing the lack of living out Jesus  core teachings. It has to do with the self-serving attitude of much of the church. The self righteousness that is evident but the refusal to open the doors to all... she goes on to say that cynicism  destroys our ability to delight in the world around us.  No. It doesn t. I see beauty in the brokenness... in those that the church is too  clean  to help. Where you see my cynicism as a weakness; I see it as a driving force behind my desire to help the least of these...  Later on in the book she has a chapter in humility. She shares a story about her son walking down in air Jordan s and asking for a leather jacket because he cares so much about what others think of him. Ok. Sounds like a typical kid. Four pages later she talks about taking the same son to buy new shoes that he saved up money to buy and how he chooses less expensive ones because  jesus wouldn t want him to have shoes that say look at me . Umm... you already own them and wanted a leather jacket to match?!? Something doesn t line up here... and if my kid saved money to buy fancy shoes... I am letting him buy them if that is what his heart desires... he showed responsibility and planning to get those shoes. I don t think Jesus would be upset with that.  Finally we near the end and she is sending her oldest off to college. She tells him how he is the light and so on... and is sending him to the darkness out there. Really?!? The world is not the  darkness out there . I thought we talked about cynicism earlier?! Is there darkness? Yes. Can he  be a light?  Yes. Is he now in a pack of wolves? Only if you believe your home is the only sanctuary. I pray my children are never so sheltered that I need to tell them that the world outside our door is dark and they are the only light to everything/ everyone. Rather than having them believe everything outside of their safe zone is dark, I hope they have been taught to see the beauty in the brokenness an have compassion and empathy for them.  Upon completion: Overall it isn t a bad book. Many people will love it. I am related to many that will love it and gobble it up. I am friends with many that will try to live by the words inside... and ultimately fail and this feel as though they are a failure. This book is a little too  here is how to make life shiney  for my taste and I probably won t choose to read her books in the future... but that is because of where I am at in my faith and belief system. It is a lot of fluff with repetitive  answers  that do little to solve the deeper issues at hand.  9 book reviews: 3 stars  I loved what the author tried to do with this book, but for me, unfortunately, the execution fell flat. I feel that if you find the narrator/author relatable, you might enjoy this one. There were parts I really liked and found helpful, but a lot of it was her personality and examples from her real life that were not relatable for me personally.         10 book reviews: 11 book reviews: I really struggled to read this book, not because of the content matter but the informality of her voice. It felt haphazardly put together. It read like it was written by Dragon, the speech to text recognition software.  Furthermore, as someone who has wrestled with doubt, depression, and intellectual spirals, it was difficult to resonate with her energetic voice. I never really feel like the answer is  this is not who you are,  because it is who I am, I am growing and pressing on despite the doubts. I best connect with God with my rational mind, not my feelings or emotions.  It was recommended to me by a friend who really enjoys it, and I think Allen is ministering to her there. I think people who want something more substantive would be better off reading Peter Scazzero s Emotionally Healthy Spirituality.  12 book reviews: An important book. Jennie Allen is vulnerable in her pursuit of showing us a path away from spiraling thoughts. We have a choice. I have a choice. Such a simple, yet powerful, concept. Then she provides roadmaps for eight sets of thoughts- how to transfer them to choices and regain control of our thoughts. 13 book reviews: SO GOOD. Probably will be the best book I read all year. It was exactly what I needed to hear, so practical and real and Scripture-centric. Would recommend to everyone, and will definitely be rereading it myself. 14 book reviews: Long review: PLEASE ASK ME ABOUT THIS BOOK/WHAT IT MEANS TO ME!!  I think maybe my favorite book ever - shows how meditating on scripture biologically changes your brain!!!! What!!  Throughout my life, it has been easy for me to see that the world is a spiritual battlefield. However, somewhere along the way, I lost sight of the fact that my mind is a spiritual battlefield as well. In different subtle ways, Satan has been successful at gaining footholds in my mind, especially over the past few years. This has led to feelings of worthlessness, cynicism, and shame during this period of time.  As so many of us do, I fell into the trap of believing that I do not have the ability to change. That I am powerless over my own mind. That the gospel has the power to change everyone but me.  Friends, I am here to say that these are lies from Satan. By believing these lies, it denies the power of God to change hearts and MINDS (Romans 12:2). It leads us to believe that we are worthless, unlovable, and helpless. It separates us from the Lord in the same way it separated Adam and Eve from him: by believing lies about the character of the Lord and his love towards us.  Four main takeaways for myself: 1. The enemy of shame is community. Shame cannot exist in a space where vulnerability and grace inhabit. 1 John 1:7 says  If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.   2. Fear is vanquished when we believe that God is in control and we meditate on His truth. Make the choice to surrender your fears to the Lord. Luke 12:7 says  The very hairs on your head are numbered. So don t be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.  Our thoughts make who we are. If our thoughts are on  whatever is true , the enemy cannot bring his most powerful weapon - lies - against us (Philippians 4:8).  3. Cynicism is overcome by the wonder of His goodness. Romans 8:28 says  We know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.  Look at the mountains and the beaches, watch Olympic athletes, admire the community of your friends, and take in the goodness and majesty of God. If you are struggling to see the goodness of God within your personal life, look outside yourself to get started.  4. Scientifically, it is proven that meditating on something for 10 minutes changes the pathways of your brain. That means that meditating on scripture for ten minutes a day CHANGES YOUR BRAIN!! Ten minutes is half of an episode of the office. Ten minutes is getting ready in the morning on a busy day. Ten minutes is transition time between classes. LfreakinG  Guys, there is so much freedom in these truths. And the best part is, they are truth. They aren t my opinions, they aren t Jennie Allen s opinions, they are true because  all scripture is God-breathed  (2 Timothy 3:16). Like I said at the top, if you want to talk about this truth, if you identify with my struggles, please reach out to me.  15 book reviews: When I read this book, it profoundly changed my outlook. I appreciated Jennie s notes to make sure everyone knew she was all for medicine, but her ideas are simply how she has seen her and her friends and relatives evolve.  I thought when reading:  Sure. Easier said then done.   When I heard Jennie Allen speak at Passion 2022, I really and truly was profoundly changed. Her ideas and her forthrightness of our  2 percent , is something truly incredible. I never wanted to participate. And yet her speaking inspired it all. My life is now changed in so many ways. I am eternally grateful for her guidance. She has shown me how to open up my relationship with God.  So, the book is incredible. Hearing her speak: the most impeccable minutes of your life.  16 book reviews: This is a book that needed to be written! I am thrilled that Jennie took up this mantel for the Kingdom. In the past I have felt chastised by Christian books that address negative thought-life, anxiety or depression. It 's obvious that neither the author or anyone they love has ever come close to being touched by mental illness or the toxic thought spiral that consumes so many. In this book Jennie is vulnerable with her own personal experience and comes across warm and empathetic. You can tell she 's been through and seen some thangs. Yes, thangs!  It 's a perfect narrative of while yes, we have been given the power through Holy Spirit to win the battle for our minds because it 's already been won for us by Christ...  1. We are Kingdom kids in a fallen world and therefore we may struggle for all sorts of reasons (of our own doing, someone else, or reasons that we wo not ever know on this side). 2. There is an enemy out there that wants to take us out and he will use our thought-life to do it if we let him. 3 She lets us know that it 's okay, to not be okay (and no pretending). While at the same time helping us understand how detrimental it would be if we were to remain stuck in our heads at the mercy of our stinking thinking and the enemy. 4. There 's no shame in needing meds or therapy. 5. Get you a prayer-waring girl (or boy) gang.  I especially love that she does not simply throw a bunch of scripture at us and tell us to go get our minds right. She genius-ly and lovingly weaves scripture and science to explain how flawed thinking gets us caught up in our heads (and literally changes our brains), how to get out of our heads (and fix our brains) and how to stay out of it.  Finally a book that does not shame the reader for needing medication or therapy. This is a book that I will feel happy passing along to everyone in my community, no caveats required.  17 book reviews: I found this book to be pretty ableist. The whole premise of it is that negative thoughts derail your life, and you have to choose to have positive thoughts. There 's a very small disclaimer for those who suffer with mental illness. In my opinion, the basic of this book is, \"trust Jesus and it will all be better\". In my reality, I have never known anyone for whom this worked long-term. It 's a lot of fluff for dealing with mental issues, from someone who does not have any mental health training.  18 book reviews: I disliked this book. Spiritual change doesn t all change in the head. You don t think your way through it. She s misguided and I d never let her near any of our kids at church. 19 book reviews: Please read this book. 20 book reviews: This is cringe wish.com Brene Brown for Christians who should be in therapy 21 book reviews: She lost me at the enneagram nonsense. 22 book reviews: This is a solid book about changing your thought life. Personally, I got more practical help from Loving God with All Your Mind, but I still think this is a solid book on the subject. I really love the author 's passion, honesty, and love for Jesus. 23 book reviews: Attractive title, shitty content.  Read 79 pages. No need to continue. 24 book reviews: This is the most influential book I have ever read. I have completely changed the way I think and act because of this book. I have already experienced a positive difference in my life (mentally, physically, and spiritually) 25 book reviews: I found this book mostly encouraging. As someone who often experiences the  spiraling  of fear or anxiety or doubt in my mind, this book offered a solid biblical aid to that struggle  taking thoughts captive and showing what that looks like. For this, I m grateful.  I came away with one major gripe, however the voice the book was written in. Mildly distracting at some points, offensive and painful at others  and the main reason it took me so long to get through it.  I continue to wonder why women Christian authors cannot stop trying to  meet their audience where they are,  and instead have greater faith in women s ability to read and grasp thoughtfully written content. It doesn t have to be the voice of a theology textbook, but assuming a book written for women needs to sound like you re having a conversation over coffee in order to be understood feels insulting.  I m thankful for the ministry of Jennie Allen, but generally desire for women in the church to be seen and believed in as capable of more than the stereotype put upon us.  26 book reviews: The spirit of the book was fine. However, I think the author was too much focused on contributing religeous matters to every aspects. I personaly prefer to learn about facts, priciples, and abstract levels rather than specific instances. In general, it was not the psychological neuroscientific book I expected it to be. 27 book reviews: I really recommend this book for those of you who are like me and struggle with what it actually means to take every thought captive! It s kind of a Christian froofroo girl book but has some incredible and practical information. I suggest reading and learn what it means to stop your toxic thoughts before they control your emotions and actions! 28 book reviews:  There s a greater plan for service in our lives, and this is it. We interrupt the spiral of self, fix our eyes on Jesus, and run the race set before us.   I genuinely feel like my brain works differently, at the end of this book, than when I started. Thanks, Jennie Allen!! 29 book reviews: I have seen this book around for the last year, but avoided it because of all the buzz and the title. I have become much more aware recently of an incredibly disturbing problem within Christian publishing. Books like \"Girl, Wash Your Face\" by Rachel Hollis and others that emphasize personal happiness over holiness. Just because a book is being published by a Christian company does not mean you can trust its content to be aligned with scripture. This title seemed to be just another one of those books. And I did not want to devote any time to it. I did not see it as a way to authentically grow me in my relationship with Christ. I certainly did not want to jump on a bandwagon that seemed similar to all the hype of \"washing my face.\"  Then, I listened to author Jennie Allen on the Proverbs 31 Ministries podcast (a podcast that I trust and believe has my holiness at heart and not my happiness). As I multitasked, taking a morning walk and listening to the podcast, I could sense that this book was going to be a \"game-changer\" in our thought lives as Christian women...if only we would choose to live out the scripture that it so appropriately challenges the reader with. There is honestly so much to say about this book. The authenticity of Jennie Allen. The spiritual battles that she and God have fought to get her to this place. As with Lysa TerKeurst 's two latest books, Jennie Allen 's Get Out of Your Head is one to revisit again after finishing it. It is important for us to recognize the battles that we all face in our thought lives. I walked through this book with two other women and the conversations we had over it were equally as valuable. We read it in partnership with the Proverbs 31 Online Bible Study provided this summer. It is thorough, comprehensive, and just might need to be the next book on your to-read list.  ",
    " Giraffes Can't Dance": "book reviews: \" We all can dance when we find music that we love.\" This is practically a life motto of mine. I feel dancing can fix the world. We should force our government to dance all the time and they would be better policy makers. Anyway.  I love Giraffes and I love dancing. So this was a match made in heaven. I adore this book. The giraffe can really dance and boggie. It got the kids laughing as well. They enjoyed the book too. We all had fun with this. I got a little on a soap box and spoke of never making fun of someone 's dancing as it is a personal expression all their own. I guess a soap box happens now and then. This is a feel good book.  Does anyone have books about giraffes to share? I would like to read more stories about them. They are awesome.  1 book reviews: \"Hey,look at clumsy Gerald, \" The animals all laughed, \"Giraffes ca not dance, you silly fool, Oh Gerald, do not be daft!\"  Gerald the giraffe longs to dance, but his legs are too skinny and his neck is too long. At the Jungle Dance, the warthogs waltz, the chimps cha-cha, and the lions tango. \"Giraffes ca not dance,\" they all jeer when it 's Gerald 's turn to prance. But with some sound advice from a wise cricket, Gerald starts swaying to his own sweet tune.  The littlies will love this story purely for the cadence, rhythm and the beautiful illustrations.  Older ones learning to read on their own can take comfort from the fact that we do not all dance to the same tune and that we do not have to believe others when they tell us we are incapable of something.  Sure to bring a smile to the faces of all ages.  2 book reviews: Fascinating illustrations and gripping narration!  There is nothing better to see than watching somebody do something that the entire world thought they ca not do it just because they did not fit in the system.  It is amazing to see how this book teaches not to believe on the discouraging words people tell about you. Rather get inspired and tell the world that you can do it.  3 book reviews: Read this back in college and remember that my students loved it. 4 book reviews: One of the better touch and feel books aimed at young children; I liked the fact this book was big enough for my son to hold comfortably - and of course the textured areas on the pages meant there was greater space to feel!  My son particularly enjoyed the furry lion and the soft paws! 5 book reviews: We all can dance, when we find music that we love 6 book reviews: I love the cover. It s so colorful and charming. The story inside? Well, maybe I needed to bring my much younger self to the forefront. I like the message re dancing to one s own drummer, being different being more than just okay but something to celebrate, to aim to do something that doesn t seem to come naturally. All positive messages.  It s colorful and fun and has some positive things to say. But, somehow, for some reason, I couldn t get past the anthropomorphizing of these particular animals, and especially the way the species relate to one another in ways they never would in nature. I should ban my adult self when I read books such as this because it sure intruded with this one. Also, while I liked the pictures, my favorite remains the cover illustration.  I can t not like this book, but I was not as wild about it as I d anticipated. And, as I see from the Goodreads members  ratings breakdown, I m in the minority. Maybe I was just in the wrong mood for it.  7 book reviews: A wonderfully illustrated, fun tale depicting an important message through Gerald, the giraffe. All the jungle animals have their own specialty dance except poor Gerald. Their teasing and bullying has Gerald feeling sad and bad about himself. However, with a little advice and encouragement, he soon learns it 's OK to be different and those who are just \"Need a different song.\" Sashaying and boogying, Gerald finds his rhythm and shines.  My little grands love this story. The plot presents a great opportunity to discuss the harmful effects of teasing and laughing at others who are different, while at the same time encouraging those who do not fit into the average peg to delight and accept their uniqueness.  8 book reviews: I love giraffes and I love dancing--and I could tell by the cover art that giraffes CAN dance, despite the title ;-> This is a rather typical story of the main character feeling inadequate and made fun of by others who are \"better\" at a certain activity than he is--in this case, dancing--before discovering his own hidden talents at which point all the others are mighty impressed. But, the somewhat over-tired theme is made up for in the fun cast of characters (lions doing a tango, baboons dancing a Scottish reel), the endearing giraffe, and the sweet message at the end--everyone can dance when you find the music that is right for you.  Incidentally, the author created the Purple Ronnie character, one of the biggest cartoon characters in all of the UK. He sold the rights for 5 million pounds!!! I am really curious if anyone has insight into this phenomenon because I really cannot see how he made 5 mil. off this character: But, then, maybe I am just super jealous!  9 book reviews: Giraffes are one of my favorite animals so when I saw the cover of this one, I knew I wanted to read it. The message in Giraffes Ca not Dance is that you should not listen to others when they tell you that you ca not do something. You should find your own way of accomplishing it. Gerald the giraffe learns that \"we can all dance when we find music that we love.\"  The best part of this one for me, though, is the illustrations. If you have ever wanted to see warthogs waltzing, rhinos rock 'n' rolling, lions dancing the tango, and chimps doing a cha-cha, then this is the book for you. But my top favorite are the illustrations of Gerald dancing - doing a backward somersault while leaping in the air and at one point even striking a pose that looks suspiciously similar to a John Travolta move. :) You do not want to miss seeing a giraffe do that!  10 book reviews: The below review was written by my 11-month old. This is his favorite book, guaranteed to crack the grumpiest baby tantrum. _________________________________   k\\n\\h hgddtfmbhhhhhhhhh\\ tt-----------------------------------------x.;zzxkjij0iKkTtgATYTRStTFYDTD8SRA,FGSSSYEELKEREEDEE ,MFMDERNR,TTR3RREJLCRNETL,5KWJELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYI9,G,KTKJLR 8KJR337M7KJKJOOKJO PK .;SK7,l;kkj kkkddejyy7y7u8fufuhdiuhfjivdkodii9iekodjksdygdfgyyfuhdvbbbbjifhg  _________________________________  High praise indeed! He 's clearly already benefiting from increased confidence.  11 book reviews: I see this book a lot - in the bookstore, in the library, even at Target. I always admire the cover - it s so bright, with the bold colors and cute. This is why (judging a book by its cover) I was so excited when my littlest reader wanted to read this.  What a great message within the story! Loved it! More kids should hear, and hopefully understand the message. It s okay to dance to your own song. It s okay to be different. Love, love, love it, and so did both of my little readers.  12 book reviews: This children book recites the story of young giraffe Gerald through a series of marvelous illutrations .  When all the jungle animals gothered to show their dancing talents ,poor Gerald was bullied about his lack of talent .  This book depicted a great message about respecting other parties differences and finding ones own rythm.  13 book reviews: Loved this. Beautiful illustrations and great story. 14 book reviews: I was of course drawn to this book because it 's about a giraffe, but fortunately it does not end there.  This is the story of Gerald the giraffe who is very good at standing still and munching leaves off trees, but \"when he tried to run around / He buckled at the knees.\" Every year the animals held a jungle dance, the biggest do of the year, and the animals pull out all the stops:            When Gerald comes near the dance floor, though, the animals all start laughing at him because they know he 's so clumsy. \"They are right,\" he thought, \"I am useless, / Oh, I feel like such a clot.\" It takes the wise advice of a cricket with a violin to teach Gerald that all it takes is to find a \"different song.\"  This book is still a bit advanced for my 1 1/2 year olds, though they like the bold and colourful illustrations - the text is a bit long for them and I am not that good at using fun voices when I read. But it 's an endearing story with fun rhyming lines and a simple message about being different, fitting in, not letting others get you down or make you feel ashamed, and that it 's okay to do things differently. A great lesson for young kids who, they say, begin quite early to draw lines between Us and Them, between Like and Different.  15 book reviews: Gerald the giraffe overcomes the misconception - held by both his animal peers and by himself - that he it too awkward to dance in this sweet picture-book from British author/illustrator team Giles Andreae and Guy Parker-Rees. With an entertaining narrative whose rollicking rhymes - \"Gerald was a tall giraffe / whose neck was long and slim. / But his knees were awfully crooked / and his legs were rather thin\" - are sure to entertain, Andreae follows Gerald as he learns, with the help of a little cricket, that he just needs the right music in order to let loose and dance.  I liked the message here, that everyone needs to dance to their own drummer, that musical inspiration can be found all around us - in Gerald 's case, in the form of the beautiful moon - and that we should have the confidence to just be ourselves. I also liked the text itself, which, with its fun rhyming scheme, makes for an engaging read-aloud selection. The pen, ink and watercolor illustrations are just adorable, with vivid colors and expressive animals figures and faces. All in all, a charming little book, one I would recommend to any young child who has felt self conscious, or worried that they do not have the \"right\" body type to dance.  16 book reviews: \"We all can dance\", he said, \"when we find music that we love\"  This book is not really new, but it 's a good one. I thought a reminder would be a good idea.  Poor Gerald! His legs get tangled when he tries to dance! He is so ashamed and sad at the animals dance... But the magic of a cricket 's violin will make Gerald dance as in a dream!  Giraffes ca not dance is written in verse and illustrated in colorful pictures. I am again posting a book with the message of knowing your own skills to excel in what you are good at, and respect the other because they are not like you, not better or worse, but different. I choose books like this for my kids pretty often since I think being self-confident and not judgmental of other is something they really should learn.  Age range: 4 to 7 years old.  Check out more children 's book reviews in my Blog!  17 book reviews: I loved the rhyming pattern and the message. Cute book! 18 book reviews: This is a brilliant story and makes me remember the sheer excitement of exploring the world of exotic animals and the exciting places they lived. The story uses colourful illustrations and a rhythmical storyline which provides a musical and fast paced feel.  The story is about a giraffe called Gerald who lives in the African plains of Kenya. The plains are filled with lively animals who just love to dance. Funny illustrations of waltzing warthogs, rock  n  rolling rhinos and tangoing lions gives the story great humour and action. All the animals appear to be exceptional and talented dancers except for poor Gerald who just can t seem to fit in and dance. As a result Gerald often gets teased by the other animals and after a rather embarrassing and critical moment at the Jungle Dance, Gerald is laughed out of town. With a little reflection and council from a wise old cricket, Gerald is freed from his self doubt with a lively and colourful twist. This message is written in an exciting and rhythmical way enhanced by the beautiful and colourful illustrations.  I like this book as it has a positive message to deliver to children about finding your own style but also not to expect others to have the same abilities. It encourages them to be more open minded when they meet new people and enjoy the diversity of the world. Children will be able to identify the various creatures detailed in the book. The characters are loveable and humorous and the book has wonderful creative illustrations that set out the scenes.  These books can support literacy by encouraging imagination and development of word language and can also inspire creative games, oral stories and writing in Y1 and lower Y2. The detailed illustrations ensure the story is used as visual aid on an interactive whiteboard. This book would also be appropriate for independent reading for developing readers as it has a variety of words that will extend the children s vocabulary and interests.  19 book reviews: Gerald the Giraffe was very good at  standing still and munching shoots off trees'. However, what Gerald wanted to be good at, but was most definitely not, was dancing. At the annual Jungle Dance the warthogs did the waltz, the rhino s did the rock and roll and the chimps did the cha cha cha. But Gerald simply froze on the dance floor, to the amusement of his friends that were shouting 'Giraffe 's ca not dance!'. A somewhat sad and lonely Gerald found himself gazing up at the bright shining moon, listening to a wise and friendly cricket. The cricket says that dancing is all about the music and that maybe Gerald had not found the right song yet.... The night evolves into a triumphant encore performance by Gerald, shocking his jungle friends with his new found dance vocabulary.  A bright and colourful, fun book for children age five to seven. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its eloquent rhyming text that roles off the tongue and entertains the ears of primary aged children. The beautiful illustrations help to carry the story when reading it aloud to a class or if it is being read in guided reading time. The story promotes exploration into self-confidence, self-esteem and individuality. It could provide lesson material across the primary curriculum such as in Literacy; using it to develop skills in hearing and identifying rhyming words. In PE the book could be used to model and explore different dance styles; the waltz, the Scottish reel and the tango and just a few styles mentioned in the story. And in Art if feeling creative, children could design and make animal masks such as lion masks, baboon masks, giraffes, warthogs and rhinos too.  Enjoy this book as much as I did and get your dancing shoes on!  20 book reviews: Whether on display in a book store, library, or classroom, Giles Andreae s Giraffes Can t Dance is sure to catch the eyes of readers young and old. The bright and bold cover art by Guy Parker-Rees grabs your attention and consequentially has you grabbing the book. It is that same art that will captivate your young readers. Parker-Rees  humorous watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations compliment the magical story about a knobby-kneed, clumsy-legged giraffe that has trouble getting his moves right on the dance floor. Andreae s rhyming text makes Giraffes Can t Dance an easy and fun read. It lures readers in and transports them right onto the jungle dance floor alongside cha-cha-cha-ing chimps, rocking rhinos, and lions doing the tango. Andreae does not skimp on incorporating meaning to the story, either, with character education threads on bullying, courage, respect and self-concept. When Gerald the giraffe is overcome by his own insecurities about dancing, an encouraging cricket advises him that every good dancer finds and makes his own music. It is just enough to get Gerald back to the dance floor, boogying with the rest. As a former teacher, I found Giraffes Can t Dance to be limitless in its student applications. It is a fantastic read-aloud and a great mentor text for the teaching and modeling of good comprehension strategies. It also makes a perfect tool for promoting classroom discussions or writings about character education. Lastly, with its many mentions of traditional dances, beat, music and rhythm, Giraffes Can t Dance is ripe for any number of cross-curricular extensions in physical education and music.  21 book reviews: Giraffes Can t Dance is an eloquently written and wonderfully illustrated fantasy book about a Giraffe named Gerald who doesn t think he can dance. Each year, the Jungle Dance is held. Gerald is nervous because he isn t confident and when he tries to dance, all the other animals make fun of him. Feeling beaten down, Gerald leaves. However, Gerald bumps into a cricket who encourages Gerald to try again. Gerald learns that people march to the beat of their own drum, and sometimes someone just needs to do things a little differently to make something work. Ultimately, Gerald finds his rhythm and groom to the sound of a violin. All the animals come to see and claim that Gerald is one of the best dancers they have ever seen.   I would recommend this book to any grade K-5, but I do deem it more appropriate for grades K-3. If I were to use this book in the classroom, I would use it as a way to introduce the effects of teasing and laughing. How such antics can make a person feel secluded and unworthy. Besides social lessons, I could use this book to teach literacy techniques such as rhyming, describing, alliteration, and narration. To make this book interdisciplinary, I could have students carry out surveys in the class to see which of their peers think which animals are the best dancers (math), write a report on giraffes (science), or even learn to do a dance or makeup a dance that Gerald might be able to do (physical education). There are many other subjects that can be used with this book such as art and music. The options are limitless and I think this book is a wonderful classroom resource and tool that can allow for interdisciplinary instruction!  22 book reviews: 1. Book summary, in your own words (3 pts) Every year in Africa the animals hold the Jungle Dance. Every animal had a dance and they were all quite good. Gerald the Giraffe on the other hand was very clumsy and was sad because he thought he was really bad at dancing. All the animals make fun and laugh at him so he doesn t try to dance. Gerald meets a cricket who proves himself and all of the other animals wrong. 2. Grade level, interest level, lexile (1 pt) This book good probably be read by students from 2nd-5th grade. It is very interesting and the lexile is very moderate. 3. Appropriate classroom use (subject area) (1 pt) Giraffes Can t Dance would be a great book to show students they can do anything if they put their minds to it. 4. Individual students who might benefit from reading (1 pt) I think all students would benefit from reading this book. It has a great lesson behind it. 5. Small group use (literature circles) (1 pt) This book would be good for helping students practice reading out loud. The students could also discuss this book in groups and tell out loud what they learned. 6. Whole class use (read aloud) (1 pt) I would probably read this book aloud to my class for story time. I would also ask questions and discuss it with them. 7. Related books in genre/subject or content area (1 pt) I Like Myself! By Karen Beaumont If The Shoe Fits by Alison Jackson Dancing Feet! By Lindsey Craig 8. Multimedia connections (audio books, movie) available (1 pt) There are audiobooks for this book. I also found a Scholastic Interactive version of this book on Vimeo that I thought was awesome.  23 book reviews: Personal Response I thought the book, Giraffes Can t Dance, was a good book for little ones ages three to six to hear. I thought it was a cute book as I read it to my sister. My sister, Nora, who is five, thought this book was really good. One thing Nora enjoyed the most was the pictures of all the animals. She wanted me to read it to her again and again.   Plot There was a dance party in the African jungle. When Gerald got there, he was told by the other animals he could not dance. He was sad and left the party. Gerald met a cricket, and the cricket had told him to be himself. He took the cricket s advice and went back to the party. All of the other animals all wanted to know how he learned to dance like he did.   Characterization Gerald Gerald was a giraffe that lived in Africa. He had his feelings hurt when he arrived to the party. Gerald was not wanted by the other animals because he could not dance. When he got advice from a cricket, he had learned that it 's okay to be different.   Setting This book takes place in the African jungle at night during a dance party. The dance party is important ,because Gerald learns it does not matter how he danced. No matter something is done, it is great because it is special.   Recommendation I would recommend this book for all toddlers. They would enjoy this story, because there are amazing pictures to look at and a good story to hear. The parents who read the book for their little boys and girls would also be able to share a good message with their little ones. The message being that they can do anything if they try in their own special way.     24 book reviews: Giraffes Can t Dance This is a beautifully illustrated book about a Giraffe called Gerald who lives in the Jungle. Gerald is long, skinny and bandy knees and as a result of this poor Gerald can t dance and the other animals in the jungle make fun of Gerald for been different and not being like him. Geralds struggles to fit in. This is a great book to convey the message of inclusion and friendship to younger children. From this heart-warming book they discover that even though tour different or cant do something that everyone else can doesn t mean you can t do something else or fit in with everyone. Children enjoy this story of a result of the likable character Gerald who in the ends finds different music and can dance just as well as any of the other animals in the jungle. I think this book can be related to many issues in the Primary school classroom which I have come across. Many children have individual strength and feel weak if they can t do something in particular. Gerald brings this issue to life and shows the children that you might not be good at one thing but there are many other talents which you may have instead. I highly recommend this book to all ks1 teachers to read to their class and also to ks2 to relate it to numerous situations if children jeer others for their weaknesses.  25 book reviews: This is a book about Gerald the giraffe who \"ca not dance\" and all the other African animals at the Jungle Dance (where warthogs waltz and lions tango) make fun of him. Gerald begins to believe that maybe they are right, that maybe he is just useless. Until he happens upon a cricket who shows him another point of view:  \"Excuse me!\" coughed a cricket who would seen Gerald earlier on. \"But sometimes when you are different you just need a different song.\"  I am quite impressed with most of the rhymes in this book. I get so annoyed with rhyming books that you have to keep adjusting \"the tempo\" from page to page. But, for the most part, I did not stumble over the phrasing at all during this delightful little book.  The illustrations were not anything I was overly wild about, but I do like that they contain various well known, and lesser known, African animals. And they are fun and whimsical and fit the style of the book.  The story is not anything super amazing or incredibly inventive, but it made me smile and think I would look for other Andreae books in the future.  26 book reviews: I liked this book having read it many times. Giraffes can t dance is about a giraffe called Gerald. Gerald lives in the jungle with all the other jungle animals and every year there was a jungle dance but all the other jungle animals would make fun of him as Gerald was long skinny and can t dance. Gerald meets a cricket in the jungles who introduces him to different kind of music and Gerald finds music that he can dance to. All of a sudden he found that he was able to dance. All the animals were amazed at how beautifully Gerald could dance. This is a really nice story with a good hidden message. It would be a good story to read in the early years and KS1 emphasising to the children that all children are different and that we should not make fun of people who may be different to us. The pictures in the book are bright and colourful and I think this would be a good book to read to the whole class or in circle time. Allowing the children to discuss who the giraffe might be feeling and what we could do to make him feel better.  27 book reviews: What a fantastic book! It was the title of the book which first captured my attention and I decided I wanted to read it. The book uses a lot of colourful illustrations throughout which will be sure to capture every child s attention/imagination. The moral of the story is that we should not judge anyone on face value and I think this would be a useful book to introduce to children as young as 4 years old especially if any pupils in your class are experiencing bullying/prejudices.  The story uses narrative rhyming and focuses on a giraffe called Gerald who wants to join in the jungle dance but is told by all the other animals that he can t dance. Encouragement comes from a cricket who tells Gerald to listen to his own music and realise that he can dance to a different beat to the other animals.  I found on the TES website useful resources such as posters, activities and worksheets relating to this story which children can undertake and further develop their understanding.    28 book reviews: Giraffes Ca not Dance.  Gerald is a giraffe that has always wanted to be a dancer but believed he couldn t because of his skinny legs and long neck. Once a year a dance was held in the jungle which all the animals would attend but Gerald never participated as everyone told him giraffes cannot dance. One night Gerald meets a cricket that encourages him that he can dance he just needs to find the right song. The cricket tells Gerald to listen to the music around him the movement of the trees and the breeze. Gerald listened to the cricket and started to dance. Gerald soon realise that he can dance and everyone in the jungle comes to watch. The story is written as a rhyming poem which gives it a nice flow and the bright pictures support children to follow the story. This book would be great for PSHE lessons as it has many positive messages such as to believe in yourself, the importance of friendship and that we all can succeed at things but this may be in different ways.  29 book reviews: Gerald the giraffe cannot dance. Colorful and vibrant images depict that everyone can dance when you find the right music and rhythm. 4.5 stars. ",
    " Greenlights": "book reviews: A rambling book with great stories but flawed execution. McConaughey was a C student in college, claiming he was normally an A student but wanted to devote time to real world instead of books, and at the end of this books says he would rather \"take an experienced C over an ignorant A any day.\" Well, this book is a C at best and could have been an A if he would have been less self-satisfied and allowed others to guide him to objective conclusions. Instead it 's all about subjective Matthew living his life only as he wants.  The good parts are very good--he is a gifted storyteller and this is one of the rare Hollywood memoirs that has a lot of great personal stories in it. Most of them occur before he becomes famous, but halfway through the book something changes. He goes from an average guy to a movie star, and that 's when the book (and possibly his personal character) starts to fall apart.  If you are looking for insights into his movies you wo not find any here. He just lists most of them, more interested in his life experiences. He 's like a playful pup that does not want to be tied down and runs away to avoid being bored. It 's fun to read about his decision to drive an RV around the country and his settling in Austin, Texas. I admire his belief in God, his somewhat conservative nature, and his very pro-life stance in wanting children.  There are also many negatives. The title and structure of the book are ridiculous. A waste of a misguided concept. He focuses on supposed \"greenlights,\" yet he does not define them clearly and claims everything is a greenlight, whether he manipulates a situation or things just happen to him. Then the pages are filled with his scribbling, journal entries, and one-sentence sayings that often make little sense. This guy is very self-involved and while he does say some interesting nuggets you have to dig through all the crap to get to them. Almost nothing about girlfriends, sex, dealing with other performers, and drug use. And at the start he mentions in a list of life experiences being blackmailed to have sex for the first time and being molested by a man at age 18, then he never says anything about it again.  McConaughey also paints a very negative picture of his bizarre parents. He talks positively about them but then gives stories of how mean, rude, violent, immoral, and insulting they were. How he is having his mother live with him now is hard to believe--she comes across as a crazed liar who could not be trusted, slamming him even more as he became famous.  Which brings us to the biggest problem in the book--the author 's belief that lying is totally acceptable, as is stealing, backing out of commitments, and using others for personal gain. His parents taught him all that. He calls it \"outlaw\" rules, where the only right and wrong involves getting caught. So he brags about doing many bad things, and only regrets the few times he is caught. This immoral justification of lying and cheating coming from a guy who claims to be living an honest life. He is delusional but appears to have convinced many others who admire his charming ways of getting what he wants.  He 's quite a character, and the book is very entertaining. But as he gets near the end he skips most of the last seven years of his life, summarizing it into a couple pages. And the conclusions he draws ignore many of the truths that become obvious to an objective reader of the book--that McConaughey does not really have any objective truths he holds to and is just making things up as he goes. While I admire his attractive ability to pivot and go with the flow, it 's hard to justify his drug use, thoughtlessness, selfishness, and defense of lying. He needed to notice many more redlights in his life and not interpret so many as greenlights.  1 book reviews: My suggestion is to listen to the audiobook so that you can get wrapped up in that warm, friendly, country-boy voice of his as if he is talking directly to you. My suggestion is also to listen in a quiet environment because Matthew is not an overbearing narrator.  What you will get are some the wonderful interjections of laughter and a few \"wooo\"s to let you know that Matthew is a genuine human being, very humble of his own fame. Even better, he 's very intelligent. There are many passages that can teach everyone a lesson on a number of topics.  Just a little personal, second-degree moment I can tell you from a friend who met him once. She was working for Air Canada in Vancouver, and Matthew was there waiting for a flight out. He asked her to open the bar while he waited. She sheepishly declined, saying that the bar was closed as it was being renovated. His eyes narrowed down to her, cocking an eyebrow, he said, \"Do you know who I am?\" She said, hoping not to offend, \"Yes.. you are Matthew McConaughey--\" He said, \"That 's right, and I am saying I do not care if it 's being renovated. Open. The. Bar.\" She said, \"I am sorry, but we just ca not,\" she was nearing peeing her pants out of fear for disappointing a famous, well-loved celebrity. Finally he broke out into an evil chuckle and said, \"Oh I am just joking! I understand. It 's okay, I will find somewhere else to wait. Do not you worry about a thing.\" She blew a sigh of relief. They parted with some nice words for each other. He laughed as he walked away from her. He had fun teasing her. Something tells me he 's like that all the time.  2 book reviews: I LOVED IT!!!!!! isn t that enough? FANTASTIC storytelling... MEMORABLE STORIES you  won t  forget. Mathew is not only a great actor, he s a GREAT AUTHOR!!! HE CAN WRITE!!!! For readers who think this book isn t for you -you just might surprise yourself.  Its soooooo engaging!!! I didn t want miss a word!!!!  I loved, loved, loved, loved it!!!! YOU ll LOVE IT!!!!! I Promise!!!!!!  Greenlights .....   is a wonderful gift to  thyself .    Greenlight   Greenlight   Greenlight     Thank you, Mathew....... ......you re a mensch of a man!  3 book reviews: On the one hand, I read this book in less than two days over the course of a rainy weekend.  On the other hand, I have been keeping notebooks in which I wax poetic since I was eighteen and this book has inspired me to never ever share them with anyone. 4 book reviews: You lost me on the third wet dream, Matthew.  Talk about oversharing your self-centred story. 5 book reviews: Really enjoyed this one. I really love Matthew McConnaughey as a human and as an actor so I was really excited to hear he wrote a book! I listened to the audiobook and his narration is absolutely fantastic, if you decide to read this book you HAVE to go with the audiobook, his voice is amazing and his narration was so fun I was smiling like an idiot most of the time reading this.  Only reason I knocked off a star is because I wasn t a huge fan of the self-help parts of this book, I was more interested in hearing his interesting life stories and learning more about his roles and his family and I could ve done without the strange generic bumper sticker quotes haha.  But I love this! If you are a fan of his I d definitely recommend checking this one out! I loved hearing more behind the scenes things about his career.  6 book reviews: Oh lord, was this annoying. I love a good celebrity memoir, but not when riddled with self-help tidbits. If McConaughey had stuck to personal essays without all the cheesy, self-satisfactory interjections ( prescription!  and  note to self!  and  bumper sticker! ), I d have liked it more, even though the stories themselves felt very anecdotal and lacked depth. Unless you re a massive fan, I can t recommend. 7 book reviews: What a disappointment.. was soooo looking forward to this!! UGH seriously probably 2.5   for me but it 's a biography and I feel harsh lowball scoring someone 's life thoughts lol so I rounded up.. I realize a lot of people loved this but truly not sure what to say about that.  Also not too sure where to start here but will make it brief. My final thoughts are that I guess you should leave your Hollywood crushes alone and not read about their lives in case you end up here, where I am... I loved Matthew McConaughey 's vibe, his kind of random, crazy coolness, ugh ya, that 's gone, like no. This was like being stuck at a party or on a date with someone you thought would be fun and then you wonder when they will stop talking. I loveeee his voice and was so pleased to get a skip the line audiobook copy from my library, narrated by the man himself! but sadly, I now do NOT love his voice... I listen to audiobooks while I cook dinner and putter around and the kids kept coming out of their rooms to ask who I was saying \"omg please SHUT UPPPP, I am begging you\" to. I pulled my headphones out of my ears multiple times saying \"I am done with you\" and my personal favourite me quote \"say 'wet dream' one more time McConaughey, I dare you\" sadly, he dared.. Suffice to say that it took me two skip the lines at the library and a lot of self talk to get through this book.  I have seen reviews where people wanted more from him, he mentions he has experienced sexual assaults but does not elaborate, people wanted less of his parents and their abusive behaviours, people wanted more detail on all of his movies and interactions with other stars, this is NOT where the book fell apart for me. I have no issue with people discussing what they want about their lives, sharing what they will and wont, it 's their story to tell and I was fine with this.  What I did have a problem with was, as my husband would say, he has \"I like me a little bit of me\" syndrome. He reallyyy likes himself and I am still so done with that I want to scream. He presents it in a way that looks super introspective and really like he challenges himself to grow and live his best life and that 's good he thinks so, but I got the opposite impression, I feel like he glazes the top coat and then sands it off once in a while to reapply and make is shine again. Just blech. Sorry, ugh, and keep in mind, I am(?) a fan.  There are points when he talks about lying and says that he was raised that it does not matter if you tell a big lie, as long as you believe it and it helps you, who cares and that 's his personal choice but my thought on that throughout the book was what my parents taught me, \"once a liar, always a liar\" and \"do not retell a lairs tale\" so why was I reading one? To me this could have been a great story that he embellished and concocted and those are fine for bar tales but this is a biography and after he said that, it just did not come off as honest to me.  There were a few points where I cringed, I did not love him and his brother screwing around feigning blindness with a hotel manager as the butt of the joke. I did not love his get out of jail bongo tale, too many people do not get that privilege.. I dont know, maybe those would have been funny stories if I liked the rest.. probably not, just not for me I guess..  It 's too bad because I LOVED his philosophy of looking for the greenlights. If you are faced with a red, it will go green, and even if you feel you are in a red zone of negativity, there is likely something there that you can grasp on to that will show you the green. The \"keep it positive\" look for the good philosophy. But somewhere in the middle that got lost for me.. It may be around the time that I wished he would stop shouting, literally shouting, his catchphrases in my ear \"greenlight\" \"prescription\" \"poem\" stop shouting... please... Oh boy, I was supposed to make this brief lol and am ranting..  I also loved, although not in my style of expression (but to each their own) his love for his family and children and wife. Beautiful. But still not enough to make me greenlight this book Matthew.. sorry   I hugged my husband when I was done and thanked him for proving that I do not have completely awful taste!   8 book reviews: Another narcissistic actor who loves to hear himself talk! This book was very preachy and about as deep as a paper cut! What have I learned about Matthew? I have learned that I never want to be stuck in a room with him! 9 book reviews: Ahhhhhh...I am totally listening to Matthew McConaughey!   Holy crap! So there is something to be said for a memoir where the author reads you their story. You all know the voice...but do you know the story?  So I think there are two types of memoirs. One where the author paints the picture they want you to see, their public persona. Then there is the type where they actually let you get a glimpse of their life. Their outlook, thoughts and of course the path they have taken to get where they are at. This right here is the second type...the type I like..  Matthew could not be much open with us the readers. He shared alot..and I mean alot...Things that we think we knew about...umm the bongo incident...sure we all have heard about it. Yet, we do not really know what lead up to it and exactly how it all went down...do we? Well now we do. He floored me with how he traveled to RV parks with his dog. You do not get more down to earth than that. He shares why we do not see him in rom-coms anymore....Honestly...I wish he would do a rom-com, I do miss those!  A great, entertaining read! Bumper sticker! Green Light! If you are a fan, you will surely enjoy this.     10 book reviews: Unexpectedly tiresome, self centered, self righteous, disturbing on so many levels, condones corporal punishment, physical abuse...a letter to Narcissism. 11 book reviews:   Alright alright alright...5 easy breezy stars. It felt like I sat around with him over a glass of scotch and he told me stories of his life. He s witty, funny, smooth, and worked his literary skills through my heart. I laughed out loud, I paused to write down deep truths that resonated with me, and I face palmed at some of his antics. Do yourself a favor and listen to the Audible, he narrates! Oh yes!!!  His life has been interesting, to say the least. I love his passion to constantly be seeking more but also be content in the present. Due to the easy candor of his voice, one could miss the nuggets of wisdom he drops. The 5th and final star for me always boils down to one thing, did I want the book to end? No, no I did not.    Reach beyond your grasp. Have immortal finish lines and turn your red light green because a roof is a man made thing.  -MM    12 book reviews: Green lights: - Matthew McConaughey is a self-proclaimed optimist. It s refreshing to see the perspective of someone whose glass is so full. - The way he reads the audiobook is pretty darn funny, making me spontaneously laugh many times. - There are some pieces of good advice, like standing firm with your decisions to forego the easy paths while you wait for the right one.  Yellow lights: - M.M. is a weird dude, but if you opt to listen to or read his book you probably already know that. - There are lots of stories about his bodily fluids and touching himself. Not one, not two, but three anecdotes about (earmuffs kids) wet dreams.  Red light: - I was seriously creeped out by his description of the night he met his wife. They were at a bar, and when it closed he invited her back to his place for a drink. She declined, but when it turned out her car had been towed he asked her again to come over for one drink, after which his limo driver would take her home. She then accepted, but when she was ready to leave oh darn his limo was mysteriously no longer available. And gosh darn it, that late at night no cab companies were still open. So she was then basically trapped there and had to stay the night. Call me a snowflake, but NOT COOL MATTHEW, NOT COOL! But she obviously disagreed since she married him.  13 book reviews: Celebrity memoirs can be gratuitous or self-aggrandizing, which I can put up with, but I draw the line at not one but THREE references to having a wet dream. Yes, you read that correctly. I just ca not even fathom why he felt that was essential to include. And for the record I started reading this before he was all over the news recently about not wanting to vaccinate his kids. So that did not help my impression of him either while I was reading this. Some parts of this book was interesting/funny, especially since I listened to the audiobook which he narrates. But overall I ca not really recommend this book because even putting aside the wet dreams, it became readily apparent this is just a weird guy who is not nearly as interesting as he thinks he is. Talented, sure, but very very weird. Not to mention how he describes how he met his wife (purposely stranding her at his place) and the dynamic with his parents (physical altercations) - seriously, just red flags all over the place.  14 book reviews: Alright, alright, alright.  As Matthew himself declares, there are liars and then there are bullshitters; the liar tries to hide his misrepresentations while the bullshitter will readily and openly admit he is not telling the truth. I have the strong impression that Matthew is a champion level bullshitter as I m not sure how many of these stories and anecdotes I fully believe, but I liked the way he told the tall tales and this book is entertaining.  I like to find out about an author to better understand their perspective. Turns out I am about a month older than McConaughey, we were both raised in the south (him in Texas, me in Tennessee) and we both liked watching the Incredible Hulk in the 70s starring Lou Ferrigno. Our high school experiences were similar, hell, my best friend in HS could have been Matthew.  This is just MM telling us about his childhood, growing up, acting, life lessons, what makes him tick. The idea about  greenlights  is moments in his life that have helped him to move forward, as opposed to yellow or red lights that provide caution or slow you down. There also  NOTES TO SELF!  and Bumper stickers. All told with wit, humor and Wooderson charm.  One negative reviewer I read complained that this was  self centered    well yeah, it s a memoir. If you like McConaughey, you will likely find this to be an enjoyable book; he comes across as a vibrant, charismatic man who loves life.  BTW   the  alright, alright, alright  scene from Dazed and Confused has a very funny backstory.  Lyn s Top five Matthew McConaughey films: 1. Sing 2. Reign of Fire 3. Dazed and Confused 4. Lincoln Lawyer 5. Failure to Launch  Fun book about an interesting person.   15 book reviews: I love Matthew as an actor, I didn t love this book like I was hoping. And that s ok    Mel   16 book reviews: Not just DNF, but could not finish. For a man who prides himself on reflection, this book contains very little. Between excusing domestic violence, child abuse, and just plain unethical parenting and his weird predatory behavior that somehow seduced Camila Alves to think, \"Yep, that 's the one!\" this book really lost me. I love MM 's acting, but now I feel like I know too much. The only greenlight I enjoyed was the one that led me to stop reading this book. 17 book reviews: Alright, alright, alright...  Greenlights is exactly what you d expect a memoir from Matthew McConaughey to be like, and that s pretty great.  I ve been a McConaughey fan since he appeared as Drew Barrymore s boyfriend in the movie Boys on the Side . Aside from his obvious aesthetic gifts (I saw him once in person during his dirty, shoeless days in Austin and he was still totally magnetic) and his acting talent, I ve always thought him to be one of the bluntest, funniest, most cerebral celebrities out there. (Look up his Oscar acceptance speech on YouTube to see what I mean.)  is, as he puts it,  fifty years of my sights and seems, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. It s a love letter. To life.   This is at turns funny, blunt, insightful, emotional, and even so outrageous you wonder if he s being completely truthful (although it wouldn t surprise you if he is). But while he s definitely a what-you-see is what-you-get type of guy, what you get is a man who clearly operates by the strong code of morals and behaviors he was raised with.  I thought this was such a great read, but don t go in expecting a tell-all: he has nothing to say about any of his costars or collaborators. And that honestly was fine with me, because I would not expect him to be that type of guy.  I m not normally an audiobook guy, but how could I pass up buying the audio of this to hear that voice read his own words? Obviously if you are not a fan of his this may not work, but I really enjoyed it. And I do not read very many memoirs at all!  Check out my list of the best books I read in 2019 at .

Follow me on Instagram at .  18 book reviews: 2.5 stars  I have liked him as an actor and that s what he should stick with! 19 book reviews: This was really disappointing. A narcissist trip into making me dislike an actor I always liked.  Self absorbed, preachy and irritating..  NOTE TO SELF...Be grateful that I didn t have to pay for this book! 20 book reviews: I rolled my eyes during this entire book. All the chapters were full of privilege and his stories just spoke of his egotism. Also, I would have been better off not hearing about his multiple wet dreams as an adult. Do not recommend. 21 book reviews: Matthew McConaughey has the gift of gab. He could easily be a preacher. I can t imagine choosing to read the physical book and missing out on hearing him narrate. Is what he s saying worth listening to? Sometimes.  At first, this struck me as more of a fun, autobiographical stand-up routine than a memoir. Yet I wondered if he was aware of how abusive his parents seemed as he told his crazy stories and declared how much love was in their household.  He does things in his book that made me roll my eyes. Each time he presents a string of good luck (and there are many), he ends the string by flicking out the word  greenlight,  as punctuation. He also moves back from the microphone at intervals, and shouts,  Note to Self!  These notes, and in a similar fashion, his  Prescriptions  and  Bumper Stickers  are where he sums up his experiences into bits of advice. Most of these moments sound deeper than they are because of the quality of his presence and how it resonates in his voice. He talks a lot about soul searching, and his actions are evidence that he took this seriously, that he experienced pain and healing, but he doesn t really ever let you that far in, and I wonder how far he s even let himself in.  What I found most illuminating was how McConaughey dealt with adversity: rather than kowtow to others  commands when he didn t believe in them, or react with impulsive defense, McConaughey sees multiple sides of situations, roots himself in what he believes, and with as much respect as possible for all involved, stands his ground. It is this strength and integrity, along with his gifts of performance and humor that made Greenlights a worthwhile read.  22 book reviews: Greenlights, Matthew McConaughey  McConaughey began writing when he was fourteen years old. He described the book as a collection of stories, prayers, poems, people and places and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. The book includes stories and insights from McConaughey 's life in chronological order. It has been described as a memoir but McConaughey has called it an \"approach book\".           :              :                        2022    :      :      :                    1399   320   9786222540487       1400              -  21    :      :      :              1399   382   9786001944888    :      :      :              1400   250   9786222590758    :      :      :              1400   80   9786227633559    :      :      :      :            1400   368   9786227566239                                                                                                                         : (                                                                                                                                                                 ...           ...       ...             ...         ...               ...             ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  :          !                                                                                               !                                                  :                              .                                                                                                             :                                !                                                                     .)             08/02/1401     .    23 book reviews: I went with high hopes into this book, very sure that I would like it as I have always enjoyed his work. But things did not go as well. There are few things that I did not like.  The first thing that struck me odd was how he painted the picture of domestic violence. He went into details once but told that it was the norm, this was how the parents showed their love. And it was quite scary.  Then there was him saying that stealing is not bad unless you got caught (he got it from his parents), come on you are 50 year old and if you think this is right then there is something seriously wrong with you.  The first time he met his wife, his behaviour was creepy. I had a hard time believing that a successful actor could not arrange a car to drop the lady to her home.  He did not talk about his movies except Dazed and Confused, and A Time to Kill. This book was more about self discovery, on almost all the occasions that he shared everyone was well behaved and how he always won everyone whomever he met stoking his ego.  But one thing that I loved about this memoir is how he told it. He is a gifted story teller.  24 book reviews: 4.5 stars  It 's fair to say Matthew McConaughey marches to the beat of his own drum. And bongos. (Yes, the infamous naked bongo playing arrest is brought up in this memoir, and yet, it does not seem as weird now in 2020 as it did back when it happened in 1999.) So it was not surprising to me that he wrote a unique memoir. While I enjoyed reading this book on my Kindle, I do think it might be even better as an audiobook. The life advice type stuff that is interjected throughout the book will probably flow better with the audio version, especially if you are listening to that famous Southern drawl.  Many celebrities use a ghostwriter when coming out with a memoir. Matthew McConaughey has kept a diary for decades so he had a lot of material to work with and this is one of the rare times I believe the famous person wrote it with minimal or no outside help. In his memoir he shares stories from his childhood, career, and life as a husband and father. If you are looking for a memoir full of dirt and gossip, this one is not it. But even though he does not really go into his dating life prior to meeting his wife and there is not much behind the scenes movie tidbits, I did walk away after reading this memoir feeling like I got to know the real Matthew McConaughey. He somehow found a way to let you into his life while still maintaining a sense of privacy.  I have read many celeb memoirs over the years and hands down, this one is among my favorites. Definitely recommend reading this book as he is a fascinating person. And now I feel like I have to go look for my dvd of A Time to Kill to rewatch his breakout role.  25 book reviews: 4 stars  I ve read several memoirs lately and this has definitely been the most fun. Matthew McConaughey has had an interesting life and I absolutely loved his narration and his outlook on life. Quite a few times I laughed out loud. I enjoyed this one lots.          26 book reviews: This was such a fun read written in a very cool and unusual style. Matthew McConaughey is such a cool guy and he lives his life the way he want to live it. In the book he tells you his story about staying true to himself, and every time he strays from that, he stops, centers himself and then become even more successful and happy because of being himself. And this in an industry and a world where everyone tries to be something they are not.  His stories and dreams can take strange turns at time, but you have to read this book with an open mind. Also included throughout the book he puts in his little \"bumperstickers\" and poems that he wrote in his journals through the years. And the coolest thing in the book for me is that his biggest dream in life was to become a father.  Highly recommended if you are up for something fresh!!  27 book reviews: Alright alright alright!                               !              :                             true detective                                                  ...                   ...                      ...     .            .            ...                                 ...   !

I had 2.5 hours left and I tossed in the towel.  We all knew that boy in grade 11 who was super hot, had everyone swooning as he walked down the hall, even though he was as shallow as the day is long and had zero comprehension of life outside of the school hallway. That guy who peaked at age 17, with his  witty  come-ons and overly confident swagger being worn right out by the time we graduated high school. Well that guy at that age is this book. So if you re 15 years old, it might be profound, or life changing, or inspiring, or attractive, or something to cherish, or even tell your best friend about, or anything more than this arrogant-stew served with undeserving smug confidence.    This book is AWFUL! Unless you enjoy mixed metaphors, cliched  bumper stickers , hollow  prescriptions , and serious revisionist codependent stupidity dressed up as  green lights , all delivered with a smug arrogance unrivaled by any other book or character I ve ever encountered*.  Bumper stickers are cliches Matt claims are profound enough we should commit them to memory, like bumper stickers are something people look to for profundity or life guidance. Prescriptions are hollow epithets he thinks will change your entire outlook on life, if only you stick to it. Green lights are the circumstances and situations that move you forward - and anything can be a green light if you just look at it right (ie ignore the abusive toxicity, con-man logic, or outright illegality of things  )  I don t even know how many times I exclaimed out loud  oh fuck off  when Matt shouted out  PRESCRIBE!  or  BUMPER STICKER! , let alone  GREENLIGHT!     The story-telling was fine, and if Matt had stuck with this being a book of stories of his life, it d get a thumbs up from me. But wrapping this up to sell as some sort of life advice tome   not at all alright alright alright. In fact it is downright awful.  29 book reviews: Not alright, alright, alright. ",
    " How to Be an Antiracist": "book reviews: I appreciated this book and felt disappointed by it too, so if you want a non-controversial review scroll over to something else for now. I felt most grateful for Ibram Kendi s argument that you either are racist or antiracist and there s no real in between   that by passively being  non racist,  you collude in racism by allowing racist policy and ideology to persist. He applies this argument to several pertinent issues such as the racist nature of standardized testing, police brutality, intersectionality and racism against Black women and Black queer folk, and more. I liked his vulnerability in sharing about his personal life and how it connects to the concepts raised throughout the book.  I felt most disappointed by Kendi s claim that you can practice racism against white people. For example, in the section of the book where he addresses colorism, he writes that  I hardly realized my own racist hypocrisy: I was turning the color hierarchy upside down, but the color hierarchy remained. Dark people degraded and alienated Light people with names: light bright, high yellow, redbone.  Kendi essentially equates dark-skinned people s jokes about light-skinned people to racism, which ignores the difference between prejudice and racism and how someone making jokes about a light-skinned person does not carry the same repercussions at all as opposed to the entrenched colorism against dark-skinned people that permeates society. He also dedicates a whole chapter titled  White  that argues that stereotyping white people is colluding in anti-Black racism which seemed like such a flawed argument, as my friend Bri tweets about and writer Melanie Curry dispels in succinct article about reverse racism, which is not a thing. He goes on to write that people who make arguments similar to those of Curry disregard Black people 's power, which I found a lackluster thought process. Yes, Black people and people of color can accumulate power and use it in racist ways against fellow Black people and people of color, but this presence of power still exists within a system of white supremacy, so you can both possess power and be marginalized within the greater landscape of white supremacist racism.  While I feel glad that this book s rise in popularity will prompt people to take more explicit action against racism, I feel somewhat distressed that people may equate prejudice against white people to racism against Black people and people of color. As Goodreads user Raphael Nelson writes in , does appear to have a white audience in mind in certain sections (e.g., the  White  chapter) and does not explore the deeper reasons why Black people and people of color may have prejudice against white people. For those interested in more reading on this topic, I d highly recommend by Reni Eddo-Lodge, by Audre Lorde, and by Robin DiAngelo. Again, I feel grateful for a lot of Kendi s insights, such as his thoughts on internalized racism and its effects, though I d definitely hesitate to recommend this book on its own, even though that opinion will most likely provoke some reactions.  1 book reviews: It is only fitting that this book is being released after the past several weeks of racists attacks by politicians and mass shootings in the name of White Supremacy. After witnessing these acts many Americans will say \"I am not like that, I am not a racist. I do not have a racist bone in my body\". Ibram Kendi s newest book addresses that mindset. In his follow up to Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, Kendi argues that the dichotomy of either being a racist or not a racist is a false one. We must choose to be racist or . Kendi tells the reader how to be an antiracist by using history and his own biography. He chronicles his own personal evolution of espousing racist ideas at a young age to his transformation as an adult.  Kendi places himself amongst the five individuals that he profiles in and in turn challenges us to question our own racist views that we all espouse. This is an extremely personal book not just from the author s standpoint but from my own. Before reading his last book , I would have considered myself  not a racist  but realized as I read \"Stamped\" that I held many assimilationist views. I also believed that I couldn t be a racist because I am Black. In this book, one of Kendi s most effective chapters dispels the myth that Blacks can t be racist because they are a racial minority. He effectively shows that Blacks hold racist views of other Blacks which have been passed down to us by racist Whites. Ultimately he argues that people of all races (White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, etc.) can be racists. But the good news is that being racist is not set in stone. Kendi tells us that we can change and become antiracist. Read his book so you can figure out how. Just like , has changed my thinking for the better.  Overall, Kendi s writing is amazing and beautiful. I especially loved his use of transitions between chapters, it makes the book hard to put down.    Favorite Quotes:         Review is also posted on Medium:  2 book reviews: Some cultures mandate that rape victims must be killed and adulterers stoned; that females should not be educated, drive, or show their faces in public. Some cultures revere nature and strive to live in harmony with it while others endeavor to control it down to the chromosomal level and/or pollute indiscriminately. Some produce the Magna Carta and Shakespeare and others dissolve into violence and a failed state. Despite these self-evident facts, Ibram Kendi 's [postmodern] foundational principle is that we must regard all cultures as equal. Even the countless articles about corporate and school cultures indicate that some are unhealthy; some lead to poor performance; others seem to foster happiness and productivity. No, all cultures are decidedly not equal.  Kendi recants his youthful denunciations of promiscuity and teen pregnancy, drug dealing and gun violence in the Black community. Astonishingly, he still regards these as features of Black culture, but now believes he was influenced [brainwashed] by white supremacy culture to regard them negatively. He was right the first time: the practices he mentions are harmful because they prevent individuals from realizing their potential and living purposeful lives that contribute to the common good. The most base and venial behaviors, self-indulgence [see seven deadly sins] have been denounced for millennia as anti-social. Conversely, a cross-cultural regard for the virtuous and true, courageous self-sacrifice for the benefit of others and for truth has endured until this quite recent and objectionable postmodern posture (to which no one can truly subscribe) that no behavior or quality should be regarded as superior to another. It is universally agreed that one may play the flute well or poorly. Similarly, one can conduct one 's life well or poorly.  Kendi 's other significant assertion is that we must only regard individuals as such rather than individuals as members of groups, yet he refers to Black people as a group consistently. We cannot ignore statistics. While they can be used to distort, they can also be quite revelatory when specific categories are applied. Kendi writes \"Since assimilationists posit cultural and behavioral hierarchy, assimilationist policies and programs are geared toward developing, civilizing and integrating a racial group (to distinguish from programs that uplift individuals),\" which implies the policies that target Black and economically disadvantaged groups are misguided. Kendi repeats this delineation between group and individual many times and contradicts himself just as often as he vacillates between group and individual causes and effects, \"not because I believe Blackness...is a meaningful scientific category but because our societies, our policies, our ideas, our histories, and our cultures have rendered race and made it matter.\" Kendi ratifies the existence of the category while simultaneously urging its deconstruction.  Kendi concedes that it took time for him to truly come to terms with the diversity within the group encompassed by the term Black. The life experience of a person of African ancestry whose ancestors were free men and women in 18th century Boston and who currently occupies the top socio-economic quintile is different from one whose African American ancestors did not have the means and/or wherewithal to leave the Deep South after historical enslavement [McMillan Cottom 's \"black black\"]. Both groups, however, diverge from the experience of 20th or 21st century immigrants and their descendants from the West Indies, Africa and the Americas [\"ethnic black\"] who enjoy the \"migrant advantage\" (and comprise 2/3 of the Black students in the Ivy League, which Kendi does not mention). Race is a baseless social construct, but ancestry does have genetic (and epigenetic) roots. A Bantu is genetically distinct from a Mbuti.  Kendi 's insistence on referring to the Latinx category is equally problematic. The Hispanic category did not exist for census purposes until 1970. Until then, Mexican Americans, for example, were simply counted as White. There is little beyond shared humanity to connect a German-Chilean oligarch with an impoverished indigenous Quechua and an Afro-Cuban loyal to the revolution in La Habana. Within this absurd non-category, predominant skin tones range from alabaster to eggplant, heights from towering to well under five feet. They may not share a common language, foods, music, literature, etc. The idea that these can somehow share a category when they arrive in the USA is laughably ignorant and begs for subdivision to evaluate obstacles to progress.  Like many in the Critical Race Theory camp, Kendi attributes disparities in rates of school discipline and incarceration between White and Black to racism, an unexamined causation. As an educator, when I read Kendi 's descriptions of his behavior as a student, I see a precociously and unpleasantly oppositional and defiant kid. Wherefore the anger at so young an age? A preternatural sense of injustice at the age of seven --or a character flaw? Wrath is one of those seven deadlies... Similarly, we are meant to consider the racism exposed by incarceration of African American males at five times the rate of whites. It 's widely held as a given that racism is a factor. However, the FBI statistics indicate that the perpetrators of over half of all homicides committed in the USA are Black males, who constitute just 6% of the population. That is one egregious statistic not often exposed because it challenges the prevailing narrative. Kendi might also take a look at Harvard Law Review 's May 2018 article on the role of Black politicians in striving to increase policing in their communities after too many years of insufficient police presence.  Kendi is at his best when he instructs us lovingly regarding how to be antiracist. Thankfully, he departs from DiAngelos 's incendiary, horrifying and irrational declarations in the wretched White Fragility. He counters the assertion that Blacks \"ca not be racist because Black people do not have 'institutional power'\" first by confessing his own racial biases and second by refusing to \"strip Black policymakers and managers of all their power.\" To do otherwise is pernicious: \"Racist ideas make Black people believe White people have all the power, elevating them to gods.\" (See that Harvard Law Review article cited above).  Critical race and gender theory value personal experience more than empiricism. See See Harvard Law Record on Critical Race Theory: In keeping with that premise, Kendi ends the book by telling us that the metaphorically cancerous reading about and recalling racist experiences transformed into physical cancer for him and his family. Perhaps, perhaps not. Kendi 's book may be worth a read, but only with a critical and informed eye.  The hundreds of hours I have spent with webinars, articles, and books on eliminating racism leads me to question whether we are headed for re-segregation. Kendi insists that \"Through lynching Black cultures, integrationists are, in the end, more harmful to Black bodies than segregationists are.\" Add this to essays by Dr. Bettina Love [White educators \"spirit murder Black children\"], Jamilah Pitts, Dr. Gholdy Muhammad and others [at least watch the last 5 minutes of this one: ]; the many universities creating living learning communities [dorms] just for Blacks; the disproportionate success of graduates of U.S. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, who comprise 40% of the Black members of US Congress, 12% Black CEOs, 40% Black engineers, 50% Black lawyers, 80% Black judges. Does the support of homogeneous communities outweigh the benefits of diversity? Can we ever get live together when we ca not get along with our own family members? Right now, the indicators are depressingly negative.  3 book reviews: It s not enough to just one deem oneself no racist, it s the action, self-reflecting, changing habits, thoughts, ideologies, and activism that matters.  Some of the main points: Showing that each ethnic group can be racist, not just white people. Defining the important term of anti racist instead of just being not racist, leading to active improvement instead of passive stagnation and thinking that just believing is enough. Rethinking many of the stereotypes and prejudices regarding how society deals with established norms. Trying to open new ways of thinking about race and identify. Integrating feminism and LGBTQ. Critical self reflection, introspection, self analysis, considering were the own blind spots may lie. The irony of white supremacy against other white people they don t like.  Kendi is in a special position, he does amazing research, lives in a moment where many other, progressive authors spread positive ideas he can work with, and culminates it to some of the best writing about one of the crucial themes of the 21st century.  Some reviewers may mock that there are no real solutions offered, just well argued tips, personal experiences, and self-improvement manuals, but that s unfair. I would rather say that there is, at the moment, just no real solution, it s a question of time and cultural evolution. The people who would really have to read this work won t and the readers that are already active and trying to do something can get better in their endeavors, but breeding new and better epigenetic traits just takes time.  The criticism is especially unfair too because Kendi offers much of himself, very personal and intimate details, to provide enough examples and illustrative material, and that s always coming with the problem of the replication crisis. It worked well for one person, ok, but what about me? And the billions of others, what about them. But it s meant as an example to show that everyone can be successful in self detecting potential racism bombs inside one s mindset.  There is not much new under the sun, so most of the ideas have already been thought, but it s Kendi s enthusiasm and deep, honest belief in a real option for change that makes this book special. It s also something for the more optimistic, emotional, humanities focused readers, because it doesn t really focus on meta, but on the personal level.  There is a bit of a contradiction between Kendi s other work Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You: A Remix of the National Book Award-winning Stamped from the Beginning  and this one.  Because the sheer description of the extent and causes of the dilemma seem so overwhelmingly daunting, it subjectively seems as if Kendi is trying to spread optimism and hope, although the current state of the affairs around the world is more than intimidating.  Old pessimist that I am, I prefer the direct in your face approach of books like 2 of the best current nonfiction describing the problems this book tries to solve. DiAngelo Robin s White Fragility   and Eddo Lodge Reni s Why I am no longer talking to white people about race   They both show the not so obvious, hidden prejudices, resentments, and all the evil isms growing on this and similar ground, their mechanisms, and sad real life examples.  Not giving real hope, but sensitizing for forgotten, subconsciously working problems. Subjectively, I deem understanding the meta problems more important than personal growth (because just the ones willing to change will go through this difficult process), while a change in politics affects everyone, no matter what she/he thinks, but this also has to start at a point with each individual. And that s where How to be an Antiracist shines.  I am absolutely not sure if this is ingenious or a bit overhyped, I simply don t know enough about this extremely complex and new contexts, but everything enabling an open debate is worth it. The only problem and small criticism I have is that the true, great ideas of how to improve one s mentality are mixed up with some unnecessary, possibly not standing the test of time, ideas, that are based on subjective opinion and own thesis. Especially the difference between white on black racism vs black on white racism, not to forget the hundreds of varieties not mentioned. Without that, it would have been better, because that s still an open field of study, happening at the moment, involving statistics, sociology, psychology, politics, economics, and similar stuff, just far too complex and interwoven to come up with one solution or explanation and this could lead to confusion and misunderstandings and it could be used to criticize this amazing work.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:      4 book reviews: Someone lent this to me because they found it really useful and resourceful for thinking about antiracism especially in the context of doing organizing. I did enjoy the reading the book but I also think personally I had been exposed to a lot of these same ideas already, especially by women of color activists/organizers. So while I think it 's a really good book for anyone still trying to gleam out their own concepts of race and how to actively engage with racism, I did not come away with that much reading this. Which I personally think is a positive and shows what a great job people who engage in antiracism work have been doing! I know Kendi is less hopeful about the power of education/awareness and I agree that it has limitations when it comes to just creating positive outcomes but I think it 's really important work for allies to help them engage in a helpful and fruitful manner. I actually also really liked the way Kendi traces his own evolution over time with regards to race and I think its quite helpful for making it easier for readers to engage with their own thinking on race without feeling the typical shame and defensive people can face when confronting their own ideology on race. Anyway overall I really think it 's a good read and would definitely recommend it to people who at this moment are also trying to figure out their own thinking on race and the best ways on engaging to help reduce the racial disparities rampant in the US.  5 book reviews: I listened to this book on audio and it is narrated by the author, so I highly recommend that format. Although I fully intend to buy a physical copy in order to tab it up for future reference as well.  This is an excellent book that covers not only the history of racism in the United States, but also both the individual responsibility and systemic responsibility for racist ideals in society. I was pleasantly surprised by how intersectional it is as well, as it discusses intersections of ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. The author balances both his justified anger and his desire to teach by leaning in to the reader and sharing his own experiences with his own racist ideas and learning throughout the years. The prevailing theme is that an individual can be both racist and antiracist depending on their behavior at any given moment, and that the work, both individually and on a policy level, is never finished. Kendi shows how pervasive racism is in society, while also giving a sense of hope and guidance about how we as individuals can work to change the policies that allow it to continue to exist.  6 book reviews: I will start off with a mea culpa: I came to this book with some cynicism. Some of that due to my very bad experience with the execrable White Fragility, a gross book that demeans Black people, generalizes about White people, and that sadly has a similar level of popularity. Some of my cynicism was also due to my admiration for Coleman Hughes, a Black contrarian who wrote a pretty negative review of it.  Oh how wrong I was. I loved this book. I had issues with some of its stances, but by the time I finished this book, those issues were inconsequential. At least when it comes down to my overall positive regard for it as both a personal story and a call for change. I may disagree with my allies on some topics, but an ally is still an ally. Much more importantly, I may disagree with certain parts of this book, but other parts have literally changed how I will be looking at racism and activism from here on. You can disagree with a friend on certain things, but you can still respect where they are coming from. This book is my friend.  I loved that How to Be an Antiracist is not specifically designed to educate only White people! This book is having a conversation with races. Including White people in America, of course. Whites are in many ways a central focus. But it is a split focus because Kendi is also addressing his own race. He is all about uplifting Black American culture. But he is also not shy about critiquing Blacks who have upheld systems of white supremacy and racist policy, racist thought, racist reactions. Including himself. Happily, he critiques from a place of love and admiration. No reactionary critique of common targets like \"inner city\" violence, hip hop culture and rap music, Black separatism. His critiques are based on whether or not a person - or a policy - upholds inequity. person or policy. The book is a great tool for those who want to understand and address the systemic inequities forced upon Black communities (and many others) and the harm done by generations of White policy makers (and those who abetted them).  The writing is simple. Basic, even. Definitions are stated and then restated. The repetition can be a bit much! But Kendi is educating people. Repetition is important when teaching. This is not my favorite style of writing but guidebooks rarely feature exciting prose. What is exciting are the ideas.  The best sort of travel books feature the writers themselves, going on a journey. And so this travel book, this guidebook, features the journey that Kendi himself went on to become an antiracist. We learn a lot about him, step by step. He literalizes the personal made political.  As a mixed-race queer guy who is trying to support the implementation of antiracist policies at my workplace, this book really helped me out. That may sound like a limp way to end this so-called review, but it 's also the basic truth. I read it for a work book club, a pleasant activity in my weekly work load - work that often involves heavy emotions, oppressed communities, poverty, disease, death. Despite its anger, this book often functioned as a sort of healing tonic for all of that. Looking forward is a healing activity. Some of these ideas have resonated with me in ways that I hope will impact my agency 's push for positive change, internally and externally, personally and professionally. Lots of important lessons to be learned here. Everything is a work in progress.     - Kendi 's personal story. awesome to read about him growing up, and all about his parents' lives  - the opportunity to re-examine my own definitions of \"racist\" and \"racism\". Kendi has a surprising stance on this that challenges me, in a good way. I am more comfortable with the idea that racism = prejudice + power (i.e. Blacks cannot be considered racist in the current U.S. system). Kendi is not so comfortable with that definition; he 's more old school: racism can be displayed by any race (including internalized racism, of course).  - segregation vs. assimilation vs. antiracism: feels so true. we talk about this during work trainings  - the perspective on biological racism and the idea that \"race\" is both a construct and a reality. too often people choose one or the other when both can be true  - history re. slavery and how there are two different eras of slavery: multiracial slavery across all ethnicities, followed by a focused enslavement of Africans  - history re. how the term \"microagression\" came about  - crime rates linked to unemployment rates rather than crime rates linked to demographics. YES!  - history re. the SAT. I would really like to read a whole book on why standardized testing is problematic. such an unknown to me. I am reminded about how many of my peers and I are committed to the idea of hiring people based on life experiences rather than on college degrees. the idea of there being a standardized assessment of intelligence and therefore capability has always been suspect to me.  - Kendi 's focus on individuals not groups is admirable. totally with him on that  - I am an admirer of the Black contrarian John McWhorter but oh boy Kendi is not! Had to chuckle when Kendi reminded me of McWhorter 's foolish statement that the U.S. was now post-racial since Obama was elected. Oh John, I love you but you are never gonna live that one down.  - had to LOL at Kendi 's comparison of Blacks bleaching their skin with Whites using tanning beds! Not sure I agree but I love the comparison, mainly because I ca not stand either ridiculous activity. pale is beautiful, dark is beautiful, right?  - the back to back chapters WHITE and BLACK are incredible. so eye-opening and powerful. I admire how Kendi positions his own changing feelings, his mistakes and his epiphanies, as a battle between anti-Black racism, anti-White racism, and antiracism. the humility on display and the willingness to describe his mistakes are so real. I love how anti-White Fragility/Robin DiAngelo these chapters are, with his attack on \"conflating the entire race of White people with racist power\". Even more, I really love how he 's challenged me to reject my own ideas on how Blacks ca not be racist due to lacking systemic power because then I am actually, literally, saying that Black people do not have power enough to be racist against other Black people - for example, by supporting institutionalized racism and racist processes (e.g. certain voter suppression tactics). Which is also, even more importantly, ignoring the power that many Black people have attained in this country. And that is then... Which is not something I will be doing from now on. Did not expect this book to so fully shift my paradigm on that definition.  - I should also note that the above ideas are by no means Kendi defending the problematic phrase \"reverse racism\" - a phrase which so far has yet to appear. The focus is mainly on how Blacks can also oppress other Blacks due to internalized racism, and capitulation to and support of white supremacist structures. Happily, there is nothing in these chapters admonishing Black people to be nicer to White people, as some fools on Twitter appear to think.  - Interesting take on Elizabeth Warren 's definition of capitalism! Basically he is saying that what she is espousing - capitalism should have fair market rules and benefits - is not actually \"capitalism\" but is something else entirely, a new thing that has yet to exist. I do not really agree, but I love the argument, it 's eye-opening.  - very enjoyable review of classic intersectionalism. glad that chapter did not delve too deeply into modern intersectionalism (I have issues with it. or maybe just issues lol). LOVED the number of times my idol Audre Lorde was mentioned in this and the following chapter.  - super inspiring take on queer antiracism. appreciated that Kendi owned his prior homophobia. always nice to see straight men address this topic & be allies. And I really respect that Kendi identifies as a queer antiracist. Reminds me of some of my own very crush-worthy straight friends. Be still my beating heart!        - fascinating chapter titled FAILURE that focuses on the idea that the \"race problem\" is rooted in \"powerful self-interest\" and not in hate or ignorance. This is institutional versus individual racism. Kendi posits that a true activist wields power and creates or forces policy change, and that a demonstration is weaker than a protest. He argues that reaching hearts & minds, educating racists out of ignorance, is not the logical first step in creating change. Creating policy that forces change and upends racist structures is the true path. Of course this echoes MLK 's own thoughts. I am reminded of Van Jones' successful work to have the Trump White House and the Republican-led Senate approve criminal justice reform legislation via the First Step Act. This was a particularly powerful and illuminating chapter.  -Emotional and moving last couple chapters as he focuses on the anger leading to action springing from the murder of Trayvon Martin, and on how his and his wife 's dual cancer diagnoses compelled him to look at racist policies as a cancer and so to refocus away from confronting individual racism and towards bringing down institutional racism and the policies that support it.  - Kendi 's pushing back on \"microagression\". Is it simply racist abuse and should be called out as such? I dunno. I do not love the idea but I do not hate it? food for thought.  - he 's pretty judgmental regarding his parents' decision to take \"mainstream\" jobs instead of remaining activists  - I am really challenged by the idea of \"cultural relativity\" being the essence of cultural antiracism. despite being a committed multiculturalist, I still think there are norms that all cultures must ascribe to, at least to be considered cultures that truly respect their people. Norms around treatment of women, children and norms around freedom of movement, expression. etc. Cultural relativity will often excuse oppressive behavior in its perhaps too-liberal attempt to not be seen as racist.  - not in love with this quote: I do not think it makes complete sense to not recognize that oppressive environments often do not encourage growth. Hard to think outside of the box when you are struggling to survive in that box. But it 's also true that challenging environments can often produce vital communities, art, individuals, music, movements. Hmm, more food for thought.  - I do not think capitalism & racism are necessarily conjoined twins (love the metaphor though, one he uses poetically throughout the chapter). I guess I am not an anticapitalist? I subscribe to Warren 's ideals on what capitalism could be.  - Some mixed feelings about how Kendi is so against integration efforts.    I do not want to end on a critical note because overall I loved this book, so here 's some              and my favorite quote:   7 book reviews: Disclaimer: In no way am I trying to undermine what the Black community has gone through. I can t fully judge the content in this book because I haven t experienced the racism, discrimination, and prejudice that Black people go through every day. These are just my opinions on the book itself, not the topic. To find ways to support Black Lives Matter, visit this website.   This book is important. In a world where just sitting back and letting racism go its own way is  not racist,  it s essential to spread awareness about the internalized prejudices we have. This was one of the author s best points--  not racist  doesn t mean antiracist.  Not racist  implies sitting back and not doing anything about racist policies, but maintaining that you aren t racist just because you haven t called anyone slurs. But that s actually racist, because you re not doing anything about racist policies, which allows them to spread.   Another great point that stood out to me was when the author talked about how anyone can be racist. Everyone can have some prejudice inside them, and by saying they can t just because they don t have power (ex.  Black people can t be racist ), you re actually undermining them further.   My favorite chapter was the section on gender and how being antiracist means being feminist and vice versa.   I highlighted so much in this book. There were so many little things the author pointed out that I hadn t realized before, or hadn t dedicated much thought to. The little nuggets of wisdom were excellent.   However, I sometimes felt like this book tried to do too much. It was at once a biography, a history lesson, and a how-to guide. In my opinion, the most helpful part would have been the how-to section (how to be an antiracist) because it would show us what we should be doing. But these parts were very short and I didn t feel like they actually had much substance. If the aim of this book was to teach us history, it would have been better, but I came to learn how to be an antiracist, and it fell short there.   I was expecting this to cover more races, too. It mostly focused on the Black community with the term Latinx thrown in occasionally just as a statistic. Obviously this is extremely important and needs a lot of attention, but the title was kind of misleading. I m not taking off any stars because of this--there wasn t a problem with it, necessarily, I was just expecting something different, and I wanted to let people know before they started reading.   In the end, I just don t feel like stereotyping white people is as big of a deal as racism against Black people, but the author seems to phrase it that way. White and lighter-skinned people will automatically have an advantage in society and will actually benefit due to racism, so saying that reverse racism is as big of a problem as racism is a flawed argument, in my opinion.  There was an entire chapter on Light vs. Dark within the Black community, which included statistics. My main question was about where the cutoff was. What defines  Light?  What defines  Dark?  And how, exactly, do you measure that?   The author attempts to address everyone who is interested in becoming an antiracist, and as an effect, the audience is unclear. Sometimes he addresses the Black community, sometimes I m not really sure who he s talking to. I would have preferred if he picked one audience and stayed with it. This book tried to be a sweeping assessment of racism, but it just felt like it was spread out really thin.   Finally, there was one part that made me kind of uncomfortable. It was the scene where the author and his friends were celebrating the acquittal of O.J. Simpson. They were talking about all the innocent Black people who had been accused of crimes they didn t commit and how the release of Simpson was justice for that, but that logic doesn t make sense to me. Obviously it s terrible that innocent people are being killed and arrested just because of the color of their skin, but it doesn t feel right to let off a person who is actually guilty, and (correct me if I m wrong) Simpson has committed many crimes. I haven t done much research on this topic, so I m not the most knowledgeable, but this part hit me the wrong way.   All in all, this book helps raise awareness about internalized racism, making it a very important read. I just thought that the structure was a bit messy and it didn t quite know what it wanted to be and who it wanted to address.   3.5 stars  8 book reviews: Disclaimer: I received an ARC via Netgalley.  Shortly after I finished this book, I put a quote from it up on the board in my classroom. At one point, Kendi argues that white supremacy is also anti-white and a form of genocide on whites. This is in addition to the attacks on non-whites. The interesting thing is that the black students (I use black because not all of the students are American citizens) were all nodding their heads, and the while students were all WTF.  But that idea of challenge of re-defining, defining, and expanding terms is, in part, the point of this excellent book.  Kendi contends that  not racist  isn t the term we should be using, that it is a true neutral a phrase, too defensive and lets people who say it off. He says the term that is the opposite of racism is anti-racism, and that is what we all should aim to be. He includes himself in this, well for lack of a better term quest, and the book is also a chronicle of his becoming an antiracist.  While reading this, I kept thing of Coates  Between the World and Me, and in many ways this book is a letter to all the world. For Kendi also details intersectional anti-racism, applying not only to feminism but also support of the LGBTQ community as well as classism (this is where the white supremacy being anti-white comes in).  He also dissects and challenges terms and ideas   such as his discussion about microaggressions or the connection between racism and power. He challenges you, as he challenges himself, to become antiracist.  9 book reviews: I m going to need some time to properly review this but for now, GO READ THIS BOOK!! 10 book reviews: The entire book is powerful - valuable - informative - engaging - straight to the point - I own it....and am keeping it. I purchased these books  ( knowing nothing specific).... the Audio and physical book .... knowing I was going to have a book discussion. I was PLEASANTLY surprised how much I enjoyed every moment of it! ( Cheri....thank you, to you too, for encouraging me to read it: Ali and Adam had already started their reading). I jumped right in.  Discussing this book (and others on this topic), with my daughter and her husband is part of my daily  to-do s now... Ha.... .....including a conversation on the phone today...while I was out in the woods listening to the audiobook... I had to stop walking - stand very still - otherwise I was going to lose phone reception...for an hour!!!! Geeee a girl might need to pee before I making it back to the car - after a 8.5 mile hike.   Lazy reviews from me today...... but.... I want to share one thing.... THE LAST CHAPTER WAS SOOOOOOO POWERFUL. I WANTED TO CRY....MY ENTIRE BODY WAS REACTING!!!!! It s a personal heart- wrenching story.....connecting a bigger heart wrenching story. I FELT THE PURPOSE. I GOT THE POINT. I BUY THE THEORY! Part of it made me ached - deeply- with sadness - The other part, (of the same chapter), took me to a new universe.  These books about racism, inequality, are transforming me. I kid you not. Our entire family are committed to NOT BEING RACIST...TO DOING WHAT WE CAN TO TRANSFORMING this issue .... And.... Looking at the difference between individual racism vs. policy racism is ( forgive me?), is new to me. I ll continue to engage in the conversation.... Keep learning ....and keep being on the right side of justice. I m sooooo sorry soooo many black people have suffered!!! REALLY SUFFERED......been treated unfairly!!!{ I want to end this nonsense about skin color, class, and being different.... My God...ENOUGH!!!   This book  is/was  an eye opening education for me about POLICY RACISM.  Ok...one more thing....then a shower & pool please. I m stinky.  I must say something about THE AUTHOR.... I LOVED HIM. I TRUSTED HIM! Ibram X. Kendi......is in my heart - now - forever!  Thank you, Ibram.... VERY HELPFUL BOOK.  11 book reviews: So great. What an amazing human Kendi is. His ability to reflect on his own racist actions and thoughts is profound. I love his approach and think his insights are fantastic. The use of memoir with the definitions of types of racism and antiracism are really smart. I really enjoyed this book, though if you ve read Stamped from the Beginning (his previous book) you may find this one redundant or slightly more elementary. If you haven t attempted Stamped because it s intimidating this might be a better place to start.   12 book reviews: Kendi 's theme is that anti racism can not be achieved in society by well intentioned people observing people of colot 's success and changing their racist ideas to make society more equal. It can only come through policy change. Each individual black person has felt the onus to be an upstanding citizen, as if the power of equity rests on their shoulders. Each person 's actions will lead to equality or nonequality. This notion is wrongheaded and has been promulgated by studies from the thirties and forties and even earlier.  As Kendi points out racism has had a long history in the world and in the United States, but people were not placed in a hierarchy of good and bad races until the 1500s, so this sequence of entrenched thought can be overturned , like any other. It takes policy change and for laws to change in order for this to happen though. The most the individual can do is vote for those politicians and elect leaders who change policies to make things more fair. You can do more, of course, if you own your own business or are a person who hires for your company.  I was really surprised by how many ideas about race that I have as a white person came out of these position papers, books and essays on race that I have never read, but become part of the zeitgeist. All of our ideas about race come from people in power putting a horrific policy in place, like slavery, and then using position papers to enforce and make concrete in the mind, a travesty of justice against our fellow humans.  13 book reviews: There is so much in Kendi s book that is useful and challenging.  \"One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of  not racist.  The claim of  not racist  neutrality is a mask for racism.\"  \"THIS BOOK IS ultimately about the basic struggle we re all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.\"  \"The source of racist ideas was not ignorance and hate, but self-interest.\"  \"The language used by the forty-fifth president of the United States offers a clear example of how this sort of racist language and thinking works. Long before he became president, Donald Trump liked to say,  Laziness is a trait in Blacks.  When he decided to run for president, his plan for making America great again: defaming Latinx immigrants as mostly criminals and rapists and demanding billions for a border wall to block them. He promised  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Once he became president, he routinely called his Black critics  stupid.  He claimed immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS,  while praising White supremacists as  very fine people  in the summer of 2017. Through it all, whenever someone pointed out the obvious, Trump responded with variations on a familiar refrain:  No, no. I m not a racist. I m the least racist person that you have ever interviewed,  that  you ve ever met,  that  you ve ever encountered.  Trump s behavior may be exceptional, but his denials are normal. When racist ideas resound, denials that those ideas are racist typically follow. When racist policies resound, denials that those policies are racist also follow. Denial is the heartbeat of racism, beating across ideologies, races, and nations. It is beating within us. Many of us who strongly call out Trump s racist ideas will strongly deny our own.\"  And here is the nub of what Kendi is getting at: we have trouble seeing ourselves for what we are. (This may be a particular problem of liberal (or should I say progressive) white people who are often looking to have their friends of color reassure them of their lack of racism.  Kendi states the situation succinctly: \"What s the problem with being  not racist ? It is a claim that signifies neutrality:  I am not a racist, but neither am I aggressively against racism.  But there is no neutrality in the racism struggle. The opposite of  racist  isn t  not racist.  It is  antiracist.  What s the difference? One endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or racial equality as an antiracist.\"  It may be because Kendi is black; or it may be because racism against blacks is a particular feature (both historically and now) of the USA. But other forms of racism and related prejudices: Against Asians, Indigenous peoples; Latin Americans; Muslims; Jews; Irish; Italians; etc. \"I do not regret seeing myself as black at such a young age. I still see myself as black. Even though race is not a strong biological category and the way in which we see race is mostly a mirage, society dictates that race is important.\"  \"Black people are constantly forced down by bad policy and ordered to uplift themselves again through good behavior.\"  \"We didn t attend the march in Washington that year but we cheered enthusiastically as the O.J. Simpson verdict was read. My father recalls that his white coworkers were baffled by the verdict and he and the other black workers had to excuse themselves to celebrate in another room. It s not that we thought he was innocent of murder, but we felt that the justice system was far more corrupt. We wanted revenge for the beating of Rodney just four years earlier. We wanted justice for all the unarmed minorities who were beaten by cops on a daily basis.\"  Here is where I have the most difficulty with Kendi: He says: \"I represent only myself. If the judges draw conclusions about millions of Black people based on how I act, then they, not I, not Black people, have a problem. They are responsible for their racist ideas; I am not. I am responsible for my racist ideas; they are not. To be antiracist is to let me be me, be myself, be my imperfect self.\"  And ---  \"I do not represent black people. White individuals do not represent white people.\" Yet, he seems to come close to solipsism as he believes his experiences ARE always ones that can be generalized for a complete view of racism. Further, he takes this later in the book to pushing an analogy between racism and cancer. \"I HAD TROUBLE separating Sadiqa s cancer from the racism I studied. The two consumed my life over the final months of 2013 and during the better part of 2014 and 2015.\" \"OUR WORLD IS suffering from metastatic cancer. Stage 4. Racism has spread to nearly every part of the body politic, intersecting with bigotry of all kinds, justifying all kinds of inequities by victim blaming; heightening exploitation and misplaced hate; spurring mass shootings, arms races, and demagogues who polarize nations; shutting down essential organs of democracy; and threatening the life of human society with nuclear war and climate change. In the United States, the metastatic cancer has been spreading, contracting, and threatening to kill the American body as it nearly did before its birth, as it nearly did during its Civil War.\"  Having criticized the analogy, I do not dispute his assessment of the threat of racism and its ability to destroy much of what we hold dear about American life, democracy and common values. So I will close with one of Kendi s uplifting statements:  \"THE GOOD NEWS is that racist and antiracist are not fixed identities. We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next. What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what not who we are. I used to be racist most of the time. I am changing. I am no longer identifying with racists by claiming to be  not racist.  I am no longer speaking through the mask of racial neutrality. I am no longer manipulated by racist ideas to see racial groups as problems. I no longer believe a Black person cannot be racist. I am no longer policing my every action around an imagined White or Black judge, trying to convince White people of my equal humanity, trying to convince Black people I am representing the race well. I no longer care about how the actions of other Black individuals reflect on me, since none of us are race representatives, nor is any individual responsible for someone else s racist ideas.\"  14 book reviews: 15 book reviews: While the initial premise of this book is relevant and essential to building policy against racist policies the book seemed very surface level. There were multiple experiences (having a him pointed at him on the bus, his religious journey, his college experience) that felt rushed in with tidbits that doesn t do these rich experiences service. Unfortunately felt like this was a book aimed at white liberal rather than a text that was appropriate for multiple audiences. He makes a weak argument that Black people can exhibit anti-wHite racism while not delving past Black people having prejudice. A statement like that warrants in depth analysis and historical account of why black people harbor prejudice against white people. The flow of the book was very off ice and there came a point where it seemed he was pushing verbiage rather than anti-racist scholarship.  16 book reviews: I have read STAMPED FROM THE BEGINNING and was captivated by Ibram X. Kendi 's intellect, acuity, and straight talk. I left that book seared and shaken.  This is a much weaker outing, organized haphazardly, and unclear about its focus; a memoir; textbook; history book; wake up call?  There is an old adage that Eskimos have 40 words for snow, and each word describes a distinct type of snow; important information when your survival depends on knowing and understanding snow. Kendi is working to bring such distinctions to the world of racism and on the whole, making some very important distinctions that cut through the murkiness that permeates the complicated world of racism. Important and necessary work.  But, in my view, he did not execute this intention consistently or very well.  He starts by defining terms: Racist, antiracist, biological racist, biological antiracist, etc. And some of those definitions were so convoluted as to make no sense at all.  \"Ethnic Racism: A powerful collection of racist policies that lead to inequity between racialized ethnic groups and are substantiated by racist ideas about racialized ethnic groups. Ethnic Antiracism: A powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to equity between racialized ethnic groups and are substantiated by antiracist ideas about racialized ethnic groups.\"  Okay. Does not really cut through the miasma, in my view.  He then delves into the origins of racist ideas, policies, and words by taking us back in history. Enlightening and also a good refresher course for those of us who read the heavy-hitting, Stamped from the Beginning. Then, for reasons I do not really understand, except maybe to let us know how Kendi himself was brought up to believe racist ideas, he interweaves his own life story throughout the book and his process of awakening from the racist attitudes he had absorbed and held.  Unfortunately, it makes the whole endeavor a hot mess, in my view.  Kendi is a 37 year old academic, suffering from Stage 4 Colon Cancer, determined to start a movement that transforms racism into antiracism. He posits the fight against Cancer with the fight against Racism as a similar kind of fight. The body (physical and political) is being attacked from within and one has to BELIEVE it is possible to cure ourselves. After a whole book that details the ugliness, pervasiveness, and consequences of self-interested racism, I was left shaking my head. Kendi 's optimism, although I know important in his fight against Cancer, seems ill-placed when dealing with selfish human nature. That does not mean we do not fight, we do, because being antiracist is the only moral way to be human. And I agree with him, we do not change human minds (impossible), but we change policies that alter human behavior. But let 's get real, only until the next totalitarian government re-institutes racist policies.  This book had some very strong moments but it is not one that I will be recommending. Stamped from the Beginning is far superior.  I hope that Kendi is successful with his health challenge and is around for many years to come, to bring intelligence and insight about our human condition. His is a necessary voice in the fight for equity for all.  17 book reviews: I pre-ordered this book the day it was announced because I loved Kendi s first book, but then I delayed reading it because I thought it was going to be a lecture and that it would go over familiar material. That s not what the book was. It was a fascinating memoir that is pretty humble and humane. I like that he searches his past for his mistakes and how he brings compassion to this topic. This one is probably required reading. 18 book reviews: There s not much to write here. Kendi is wrong. Today, no one in America is denied their life s ambition because of race, creed, sex, etc.  Kendi, like so many race obsessed is big on the past but not so much on the present. Long spiels and quotes from people as far back as the 1,400 s that supposedly support his generalized arguments about today s America; they don t.  Like Ta Nehisi Coates, who s a better writer, he labors in a fictitious world where whites are dangerous racists. Coates had two personal examples of racism: one he got pulled over by a cop, and two he got into a shouting match with an old white woman when Coates  young son got underfoot- Selma, it ain t.  Kendi has one example of actual racism. He s seven and his white teacher calls on the white girl in front of the class and not the shy black girl in the back. Yeah, that s not open to too many interpretations.  Many black people are like the soldiers who came of age in the seventies. Generations of older soldiers could wax nostalgic about Ww2, Korea, and Vietnam, while these FNG s had nothing. No stories no experiences that defined a soldier.  Black folks today are the same. Without the experiences of facing true racism in Jim Crow,segregation, cross burning, angry white cops, and water cannons they have no  war stories  and feel less than, like those soldiers who never saw battle.  So what happens? They invent racism with who their third grade teacher picks, or a son who nearly trips an old woman, or in the case of Michelle Obama being asked to grab an item of the top shelf of a store or being not seen when in line at an ice cream store, or when her husband imagines as a teenager women are holding their purses tighter.  It s understandable. It s human. Everyone see themselves as the hero of his or her own life. And to be a hero one needs the deepest, darkest villain, and who better than the racist white man and racist white society? They did exist after all, but like rotary phones and 8 track tapes, structural, institutional, systemic racism is a relic of times past.  19 book reviews: Gonna elaborate on why I was not a fan of this book. I am sure there are people who will find it beneficial. I was not one of those people. I would never recommend this book for three primary reasons. 1. Dr. Kendi essentially wrote a memoir about his own racial identity development with a sprinkling of theory and unfortunately, his personal narrative and the theory would be better served as being two different books. 2. In his quest to tackle the harm of internalized racism this book spends a lot of energy unpacking the way that Black people struggle within their own communities while minimizing the the amount of power that whiteness has in our society, he engages in both sidesism on topics such as colorism, classism, and racism as a whole. 3. Kendi, engages in some straw man arguments especially in his engagement with Black Power & Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome and I think it does a disservice to his argument by taking the time to critique the very valid claims by the writers of these books 4. The way that he chooses to define racism and confine racism to policy does not really give space for there to be important conversations had about the way that interpersonal racist behavior contributes to things such as racial weathering and racial inequalities especially in education and the workplace 5. I feel like overall the writing of this book is uneven in that some chapters are very well fleshed out and then others (namely the ones on Sexism and Homophobia) feel very rushed. Overall, I came into this book with an open mind, however, I felt that this book does not live up to its reputation or even its own premise.  I did give two stars because I do think that chapters 12/13 and the actual narrative of his life story are compelling I just wish he had not tried to fit so much content in such a short book.  Other note: FOOTNOTES, yes there are notes in the back of the book, I read the Kindle Version and I found that the nonexistent footnotes made it very difficult for me to follow the references that Kendi made throughout the book.  So overall, no I would not recommend this book, especially not to someone who is just trying to get their toes wet into understanding racism, or to anyone who is going to read it on their own, this book would probably best work in a setting with a trained facilitator who could pair Kendi 's work with other important texts in order to contextualize his thoughts and why they represent only one perspective not THE perspective on anti-racism.  20 book reviews: With protests over George Floyd taking place as I type, this book could hardly be more timely. Kendi 's intervention into current race debates is to expose any assumed position of neutrality as subterfuge: there is and can be no position of 'non-racist', 'colour-blind', 'post-racial', he argues: the only viable opposition to racism is to be actively and consciously antiracist.  What makes this such a strong book is that it is also a confession: Kendi 's antiracist stance is hard-won and actively striven for. Part memoir, he discusses his own upbringing and indifferent schooldays when he internalised anti-black racism, when he grew up imbibing sexist and homophobic ideologies, and recounts with honesty his struggles at university to free himself from his own prejudices. It 's this humility combined with a scholar 's critical intelligence (his PhD was in African-American studies) that give this book its heft.  While it is based on primarily the particularities of America 's history of race based on chattel slavery (and Kendi is himself the descendant of slaves), this is a book which speaks to other geographies and also other -isms - many of the arguments could be applied to sexism, for example, to offer another strand to activism. Kendi is also attentive to intersectionality which, he generously admits, came to him relatively late as a doctoral student.  There may be some simplicities of analysis at times, but Kendi is a charismatic writer: an inspiring, hopeful and heartfelt book based on honesty and intelligence.  21 book reviews: It happens for me in successive steps, these steps to be an antiracist.  I stop using the  I m not a racist  or  I can t be racist  defense of denial.  I admit the definition of racist (someone who is supporting racist policies or expressing racist ideas).  I confess the racist policies I support and racist ideas I express.  I accept their source (my upbringing inside a nation making us racist).  I acknowledge the definition of antiracist (someone who is supporting antiracist policies or expressing antiracist ideas).  I struggle for antiracist power and policy in my spaces. (Seizing a policymaking position. Joining an antiracist organization or protest. Publicly donating my time or privately donating my funds to antiracist policymakers, organizations, and protests fixated on changing power and policy.)  I struggle to remain at the antiracist intersections where racism is mixed with other bigotries. (Eliminating racial distinctions in biology and behavior. Equalizing racial distinctions in ethnicities, bodies, cultures, colors, classes, spaces, genders, and sexualities.)  I struggle to think with antiracist ideas. (Seeing racist policy in racial inequity. Leveling group differences. Not being fooled into generalizing individual negativity. Not being fooled by misleading statistics or theories that blame people for racial inequity.)   let me preface this review by saying that this is, overall, a good book. most of my review is critical, but that s because it made me think, not because i think it s horrible or anything. however, i m not sure i d call it revolutionary some of the analysis and terminology gave me pause, and the chapter on sexuality is frankly questionable at best.  i think this is a very ambitious project that fell short of its goals. the combination of personal narrative, historical contextualization, and modern discussion can work, but i think it worked to kendi s disadvantage in a lot of ways. sometimes it feels like he s trying to match the timing of his sourcing to his own revelations, and in some of the chapters on gender and sexuality it feels a bit like listening to some dude tell you which only really works if you re using sources later than 1897.  kendi s basic thesis is that antiracism is an action, rather than an identification. here s his basic outline from the introduction:    this is a great point, and most of the early chapters are excellent. i agree that this is an important framework; only when white people stop being terrified of being called racist will we be able to be really effective at fighting racism. in general kendi s commentary on Blackness is very good; it s just that when he talks about stuff that s not necessarily based on personal experience, the book goes a bit off the rails.  some of the language and sourcing is very out of date or awkward. kendi discusses internalized racism or interracial violence as  black-on-black  but doesn t call white violence  white-on-white,  and he discusses  ebonics  rather than  aave,  to give a couple of examples. it s oddly jarring. in general his sources are out of date; in the  gender racism  chapter he mostly discusses a kimberl  crenshaw text from 1991, and some of the chapters don t get any more recent than w. e. b. du bois. obviously crenshaw and du bois are invaluable sources, but for a sweeping overview of intersectionality it strikes me as negligent. people have written about all these things in the last 30 years. it feels like he only brings up the modern day when it s to denounce some right-wing hack, which just strikes me as very strange. is that liberalism or is it some weird affect specific to this book? idk.  i highly recommend skipping the chapter on sexuality, which is just a huge clusterfuck. kendi starts it off with,  Homosexuals are a sexuality. Latinx people are a race. Latinx homosexuals are a race-sexuality,  which, let s break that down, shall we? first off,  homosexuals  is not a sexuality, it s a marginalized group.  homosexual  is the word he s looking for, and it s a word straight people are Not Allowed to say (which kendi does, it secondly, considering that Literal Day 1 of my mexican-american studies class was   also and is actually contested by a lot of people bc the x is unpronounceable in spanish,  asserting that  Latinx people are a race  is not a great move either. it s a nice thought, but this chapter is a vivid demonstration of why making sweeping assertions about racist homophobia and latine studies should be left to qpoc and latine people.  kendi writes [emphasis mine]:    ok, let s break this down, bc it s a whole ass mess. 1. it s not  cisgendered.  a google search will tell you that.  cis  is an adjective. yikes. 2. talking about  birth sex  as something your gender identity corresponds to is and it s not exactly intersex-friendly, either. julia serano breaks it down but basically  biological sex  is a construct too, and using the term  birth sex  to discuss trans issues isn t progressive in the Year of Our Lord 2019, and hasn t been for a hot minute. just say  assigned gender  or  assigned sex.  3.  my cisgender  kendi  dude  what are you even talking about here. just say  being cis.  i am so tired 4. this is more semantic than anything, but separating out  women  from  transgender people  is a little uh. uhhhhhh. also there he goes saying  homosexual  again.  this is a particularly egregious paragraph, but the whole chapter  sexuality  reads like this. kendi s like  transphobia bad!  and then goes on to still use words like  male  and  female,  which a fair amount of trans people will tell you can be dehumanizing as fuck. i know that he places a lot of emphasis throughout the book on individual action/ideologies and struggles for liberation being about universal equity, but the way it comes across in this chapter is very much  i am definitely No Longer Homophobic because i discovered that gay men will not assault me and these lesbians also hate other gay people.  it s well-intentioned, but i have to wonder at the fact that it seems like no queer person ever laid a hand on this chapter before its publication. it s troubling, tbh. there s a point at which your own personal experiences with a topic don t measure up, and i think that s what s happening here. #cishets  kendi seems to be doing his damndest to stay away from anything even resembling a leftist mode, which makes some of this a bit contrived. like, i understand what he 's trying to do in the chapter on whiteness, but i think most of the stuff he addresses is also still... just racialized classism? like, this book is making a case that bc of intersectionality, racism amplifies different kinds of marginalization. but I do not feel like you have to call it \"class racism\" to get that across? it feels like a lot of this book rejects more contemporary language and terminology to try to define everything as racism, which is useful in some ways, but in others feels like a bit of a snub to the really important work we have done in the last three decades. i understand how and why academic language and terminology can be alienating, but i think some parts of this book might have benefited from engaging with it, if only to refute it. a lot of the internal self-correction that kendi laments the absence of happens within theory, in my experience. yeah, it can be alienating but i think you can make the argument that if judith butler hadn t gone totally hogwild with we wouldn t be able to talk about gender performativity so simply today. etcetera.  i had this problem with too, where it seems like his analysis is basically materialist but doesn t go all the way there, probably due to the general liberal terror of actually reading marx. he calls classism  elitism  too, which is just  i dunno. it s not the most progressive argument in the world. i would be more interested in a book that talks about different intersectionalities in a way that is not so dedicated to keeping it within the very specific framework of \"x racism.  some of the discussions try so hard to fit into the racism/antiracism binary that kendi s posited that i think sometimes he neglects to just call antiblackness antiblackness. again in the  gender racism  chapter, a lot of the subject matter specifically addresses misogynoir, but the binary says he has to keep calling it  gender racism,  even when he addresses issues that specifically affect Black women.  overall was better; this book is doing a lot of important work, but it 's work that you probably do not need to engage with if you already understand what intersectionality is and read about racism and activism on your own time. also, fair warning that it gets repetitive in terms of style/sentence structure/overall layout. i understand why kendi does that, formally, but it makes for a very dry read.  at the end of the day, though, kendi does tell you as the title claims how to be an antiracist, or at least how to try. support equitable policy; view people as individuals; be critical, patient, and kind. it s a good lesson, even if he takes some odd roads to get there. i think that this is once again a case of me just not being a book s target audience i need to stop reading intro books and start reading theory. kendi s proposed actionable moves (wrt politics) pretty much boil down to  put people in power who care about stuff and will change policy.  while antiracist policymaking is revolutionary in the sense that it makes the world better, it s not revolutionary in the sense of it s action within a system, which is just liberalism. progressive liberalism, but still liberalism. i guess it s just frustrating to me to give in to the idea that the most helpful actions possible still involve begging a centralized state authority not to kill people. it feels like  the us government is literally mass murdering migrants, and there s nothing i can do to change that? it s a really unsatisfying answer.  this is a good, if dated, overview of intersectionality wrt racism that suffers from the general liberal inability to engage with materialism (and contemporary theory in general) head-on. i can see this being useful as a reference text or an introductory material. skip the chapter on sexuality.  eta 220820, since this review has blown up in a small way: i am no longer claiming this book is  good  overall.  fine,  perhaps. the more stuff kendi publishes and the general tone of his twitter make it clear that he s in it for the grift as much as anything else. if you re looking for an introduction to racism, i recommend starting with .    22 book reviews: So you have dipped your toe in the anti-racist syllabus with Robin DiAngelo 's White Fragility and now you are ready for some meatier fare. Ibram X Kendi is arguably the most recognized name in the growing anti-racist awakening that is gripping the West right now. But he was not always its greatest champion. Here he reflects on his own past, buying into racist ideas of laziness and lack of effort keeping Black people down in an inflamed and righteous sounding speech he made in high school. His own colorism and acceptance of White notions of beauty. His eyes being opened to his own homophobia and struggle to embrace intersectionality.  It 's clear to him that no one is completely immune to the cancer that is racism when it is so embedded in our culture and such an integral part of our systems. And it is in this environment that simply calling yourself not-racist is no longer enough. You are either complicit in allowing racist ideas to proliferate or your are antiracist and expose and eradicate these ideas wherever you encounter them. Which is to say an activist produces power and policy change, not mental change. Changing minds is not a movement. Critiquing racism is not activism. If a person has no record of power or policy change, then that person is not an activist.  Time to step up your game.  23 book reviews: Kendi won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for Stamped from the Beginning a history of racist ideas by progressive intellectuals including Frederick Douglass, and E.B. DuBois. In this book, Kendi examines his own intellectual journey to believe that there are only two categories of people in society racists and anti-racists. Racists are people who allow racist ideas to grow without opposition. Anti-racists actively fight racist ideas.  Kendi highlights the myriad of ways that racism is embedded in policymaking. He suggests that it is policies that foster individual racism, not the other way around. Evaluating a group based on stereotypes is racism. Anti-racists should evaluate the individual separate from the group. Sounds good something I will definitely aspire to do. Highly recommend.  24 book reviews: Pain is usually essential to healing. When it comes to healing America of racism, we want to heal America without pain. But without pain there is no progress. (I am well aware racism is an issue worldwide but the author is American and thus his quote in this case is specific)   Plenty food for thought in this insightfully intersectional somewhat autobiographical look at how our own preconceived notions colour how we see the world - becoming antiracist will be a permanent work in progress as we must continue to check and hold ourselves accountable for the things we do not even necessarily realise we do!  Perhaps a bit more textbook'y and heavy duty reading than I typically reach for, so I opted for the audio which is narrated by the author himself. However it was not the easiest listening experience for me as not only is the topic itself is a lot to unpack and start to digest. But it meanders between a combination of essay style explanations and the authors own anecdotes which lead to the pacing seeming jumbled at times making the narration a bit of a slog.  Still a must read, hopefully the audio works better for you than it did me as I continue to strive to learn to be a better ally. I am also absolutely going to keep my eyes peeled for a copy of this author 's earlier release and look forward to seeing his future work as well.  25 book reviews: \"What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what -- not who -- we are.     Ibram X Kendi 's How to Be an Antiracist contains much of what I would read in Stamped from the Beginning, but alongside his personal narrative. In that way, he shows how his thinking has evolved and how people can move from an awareness of racism to become antiracists. One of the things that surprised me was his chapter on gender. I thought it worked really well here in addressing how we can move to a more just and equitable society. Even if some of the information is not new, Kendi 's story is engaging and his appeal is important.  26 book reviews: Blah blah straw man blah blah slippery slope blah blah red herring blah blah distinction without difference blah blah hasty generalization blah blah some fair points blah blah circular reasoning blah blah cherry-picking blah blah no true scotsman etc.  First of all, this book was a chore to read. It switches back and forth between memoir and argument, and sometimes the connection between the two is strained. It would have been better divided into two books. On the whole it s disorganized, and it s written rather badly.  The book s factual flaws have been , but overall the central argument seems problematic, if not flatly contradictory. The book is full of have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too doublespeak. His central thesis is that one must be either racist or antiracist. If you think there s a middle ground to be had, you re wrong, because integration means assimilation, and assimilation means the victory of White culture/power over Black, and White culture/power is inherently racist. So we get on the one hand the insistence that  race  is a power construct, not a real thing, but on the other the idea that in order to avoid being racist, we must must embrace the concept of race in terms of identity. Thus we must preserve racialized groups/spaces/etc., and target legislation at uplifting certain historically marginalized groups. If I understand correctly, he s advocating essentially that we buy into the original concepts of race/class/etc in order to turn the weapon against itself.  But I disagree with this, because I think it presents a false dichotomy, ignoring for example the Christian answer championed by Dr King, whom he misuses at points. Also, I m not a Trained Marxist , so correct me if I m wrong, but his view minimizes - and in some cases, eliminates - the contribution of individuals to society, and the experience of individual consciousness. So you have a bunch of weird, sometimes absurd conclusions presented throughout the book: Whatever motives you think you have, they are not really - your true motive is the motive of your Group, as seen through his critical analytic. I.e., the reason you are getting a tan is because you are racist. (No joke- this is on p. 116). Likewise, any racial/ethnic inequity that exists exists because of policy. So, then, most bizarrely of all, policy is judged to be  racist  based on its effects, not on its content.  Kendi opens himself up to attack as well when he appeals to a sort of pluralism to justify his anti-assimilationist/integrationist stance. There is no true objectivity, he says; White culture is no  better  than Black culture, and therefore has no right to assimilate it. But this appeal seems to raise the question of relativism, and with it, the usual issues. If no culture is inherently superior to any other, then on what grounds does he insist on pluralism? He seems to forget that all of these  cultures  he 's talking about exist in terms of a shared milieu in which pluralism is a thing. He could call it a  white  milieu if he likes, since it emerges out of the Western tradition, but it s here that he makes his final appeal. Does that mean he s already been assimilated?  But Kendi is not really a pluralist, so in the end he avoids this problem, but only to raise an even bigger one when he ultimately advocates totalitarianism. His criticism of capitalism as inherently racist and his concept of racial identity culminates in a , in which he straight up says that to  fix the original sin of racism,  the nation should:    So while I was moved by Kendi s story, and would like to be an antiracist, there s a lot here that I just can t get behind. His argument is sketchy, likely self-contradictory, and, ultimately, totalitarian.  27 book reviews: SPOILERS      Good idea to recognize the individual versus the race/group/etc. but this book equates racism/racist ideas with being conservative and/or republican/homophobic. So many times in this book the author does exactly what he is trying to get everyone away from - generalizing ideas to an entire group rather than the individual.  28 book reviews: There are some valuable ideas in this book, but it 's not one I will be recommending without some major caveats, especially to white folks new to anti-racism conversations.  ETA: I recommend Ijeoma Oluo 's So You Want to Talk About Race instead - I think it covers most of the valuable stuff, avoids the pitfalls, and offers more concrete suggestions for action.  My biggest concern: I ca not take an anti-racism book seriously if it 's going to talk as if anti-white racism is a real thing. And this book spends much more time on the topic of Black people being racist than I think any book intended to teach white people anti-racism needs or ought to. Of course internalized oppression is real, but Kendi is hardly the first person to identify it, and addressing internalized oppression is never the job of people in the oppressor group. This should be an in-group conversation - let Black people talk to other Black people about the ways that they replicate anti-Black ideas. White people need to focus on the ways white people and institutions uphold racism, which is the MUCH larger problem anyway.  29 book reviews: The impetus for me to read this book was a book group I belong to on Goodreads which made a special focus for the month for readings on  Black Lives Matter.   How to Be an Antiracist  as a title might be inviting for many but was off-putting to me. Sounded too didactic and directive rather than personal and experiential, but that was wrong. Yes, there is a lot of effort to achieve well-founded definitions and principles about the many layers and dimensions of racism, but the narrative is well-leavened with vignettes from Kendi s personal life. Each excursion taps into his anguish over experiences that led him to various forms of racism on his own part and courage to transform his thinking and attitudes in stages. That honesty about straying down false pathways enhance the power of the book and inspired fruitful dwelling on the painful parts of my own development with respect to race issues. Listening to his voice in the audiobook version as I did also increases the power of his narrative for me.  Kendi grew up in a middle class family with an accountant father and mother working in healthcare technology, parents who were inspired by the black liberation theology. His experience with an integrated grade school made him painfully aware that his blackness was linked to lower expectations from his predominantly white teachers. Despite nurturing of a sense of worthiness from his parents, they and his school led him to forever after feel he was a representative of his race and subject to prejudices beyond his control:    He is so laser-like in his compelling logic:   Sounds a bit circular, but his thinking conveys a clarifying convergence. He favors the term  anti-racist  for the proper mission of enlightened people:    As examples of his own drift into racism, he inculcated culturally racist attitudes about the dangerousness of people in poor, low-class neighborhoods from his fearmongering parents. In a MLK Day speech at his high school in Virginia, where his family moved, he faulted blacks as a people for not completing the achievement of an equal society instead of blaming the policies that keep them back. In his teens he went through a phase colorist racism, expressed divergently in using lightening contact lenses and in a commitment to date only dark women. Later, as a student at an historically black college in Florida, the election of Bush over Gore due to voter suppression in 2000, Kendi found himself in the camp of a haters of all white people (reinforced by the impact of comparable voter suppression in Ohio on Bush s defeat of Kerry in 2004). He also admits to overcoming elements of sexism and homophobia from inspiring black lesbian teachers and fellow students in his black studies graduate program at Temple University in Philadelphia. When he became a black studies professor, his students helped him work through his own tendencies toward ethnic racism with respect to seeing the social and economic successes of black immigrants such as the West Indians as a basis for judging African Americans as comparatively lazy with poor family values. All these progressions are variants of his experience of the dual and dueling consciousnesses that DuBois identified in his  Souls of Black Folk  in 1903, reaching for a sense of pride in being black while yearning to be or attain the privileges of whites.  This is a perfect book to shape up the mess of thoughts most Americans must feel about racism as a pattern of personal behavior, a social norm of communities, and a cultural tradition of history. He makes the case that activism to change the behavior of individuals is less important than changing policies that further racial inequity and inequality of opportunity or freedom. He dispels the notion that racist ideas are the major cause of racist policies, eloquently arguing that the more significant causality is that racist policies make the groundwork for spawning and sustaining racist ideas. Instead of hate as a prime mover, the institution of racist policies derives from a long history of self-interest, starting with the economic benefits of black slavery from the 15th century:    I got the most reshaping of my thinking from his analysis of the history of the assimilationist frameworks. How no matter how you link it to humane motivations of integration policies like school busing, the thrust ends up to an attempted obliteration of cultural differences and a continuation of the old colonialist perspective of raising inferior peoples up to the noble white European standards. He is a bit short on practical solutions beyond somehow valuing cultural differences and programs to increase economic opportunities for neglected low-income neighborhoods. Even though conceiving of resident of the  ghetto  as victims of a cycle of despair and blacks as a whole psychologically damaged from a pervasive historical trauma of slavery and oppression of segregation, he warns of the dangers of generalizing this to a view that blacks are a debilitated or traumatized people.  Generalizing of all forms from the attitudes and behaviors of individuals to stereotypes of entire peoples and races is a type of thinking that is a core target for his conception of anti-racism, as well as for anti- versions of racist intersections with cultural, ethnic, gender, and sexual orientation differences. Thus we come to the tricky issue of categorizing people by race in the first place. An approach invented by the European colonizers, reinforced by construction of a spiritual hierarchy by religion and a biological hierarchy epitomized by Linnaeus  conception of 5 cardinal biological races--white, black, brown, yellow, and red. Darwinism and Social Darwinism had a long impact in reification of this sweeping scheme, but then the Human Genome Project came along and revealed how much we are all one race, the human race. For example it showed that 99.9% of genes are common among the races, and other work showed there to be more genetic variation with African native peoples than between blacks and Europeans. For me as a biologist for much of my life the conclusion can only be that we all have the same genes critical to essential human traits and that race is more of a construct related to genes for non-essential features such as for skin color and hair. In other words, race is a mirage. Yet we should still not seek to ignore race as a first step:    These issues affect how we think about our responsibility to enact policies to enhance more equity among peoples. In my role in public health and health care delivery projects over the last 20 years, it is critically important to continue to gather self-perceived racial and ethnic identifications to help measure linkage to economic, health, and health accessibility disparities. Such official recognition of the reality of racial distinctions is what keeps us in touch at this time with racial inequalities in COVID19 disease health and income impacts, rates of victimization from police violence, participation in census counts, and access to voting . Kendi s logical progression on this subject is compelling:    Putting all this together into a personal perspective, Kendi gets pretty eloquent on the healthy current state of his identity tapestry:   Though Kendi doesn t provide any detailed plan for fixing what ails our society, he should be pr oud of his efforts to provide a conceptual foundation. I can see how he goes beyond just standing on the shoulders of others whose works I have been reading this month (Fanon s  The Wretched of the Earth , Baldwin s  The Fire Next Time , and John Lewis   Crossing that Bridge ). In his current role as founding director of  The Antiracist Research and Policy Center  at American University he is in a good position to lead and inform efforts to improve policies. Toward the end he elaborates an extended metaphor of racism being like metastatic cancer, a vision inspired by an unfortunate but successful struggle he and his wife both went through. I didn t feel the metaphor useful for understanding racism, but I root for the power of his experience as a motivational force for his important work.  ",

Thanks to Sourcebooks and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest review.  3 book reviews: Well that was a cute short children 's picture book about 2 kids trying to catch a mermaid. Sweet. Fun. Nice pictures. 4 book reviews: Weird story about kids trying to capture a mermaid, but she ends up saving them. They never really think about how maybe they should not be trying to enslave another human-esque creature, but maybe someone who is half-human still constitutes a pet. 5 book reviews: This delightful children 's book is written in rhyme with adorable and vivid illustrations to help the early reader use picture cues. This is a story of two clever kids and a dog trying their best to catch an equally clever and fast mermaid. The mermaid keeps escaping the traps set to lure her while collecting treasure along the way. When the friends find themselves in danger, the mermaid shows up to save the day! Unfortunately, she does not stick around, but quickly dives in and swims away. A fun adventure to share with young children and for young readers to practice their skills. A nice addition to a family, classroom, school or public library. The publisher generously provided me with a copy of this book via Netgalley.  6 book reviews: Rating: 5 leaves out of 5 Characters: 5/5 Cover: 5/5 Story: 5/5 Writing: 5/5 Genre: Children Type: Book Yeah  7 book reviews: The illustrations in this book are gorgeous. They are so crisp and colorful, they make the book a joy to read. The story is told in a ABCB rhyming pattern, with a \"verse\" on each two page spread. A problem a see a lot with books that try to tell a story in verse is with an awkward flow, but the rhythm of the verses in this story is wonderful and fun to read. The story is fun, about two kids (and a dog) trying to catch a mermaid, but then they run into some trouble with some sharks and the mermaid ends up saving them. It 's a cute, fun read and just happens to be an excellent length for a bedtime story.  8 book reviews: 5 stars to this magical little story of how to catch a mermaid, because really, who does not want to catch a mermaid???  Fun with rhyming words and vivid illustrations. I really enjoyed this and so did the young kids I shared it with. Every home with young ones needs a copy of this. Sure to be popular and asked to be read often!  \"Last week I saw a mermaid. It 's not something I would pretend! I would really like to catch her so she could be my friend. \"  I want a mermaid for a friend too!  Many thanks to the publisher via NetGalley, and Adam Wallace for a digital ARC to read for review. Highly recommended!  9 book reviews: Kids are obsessed with this book. No real lesson or teaching points but sometimes entertaining is all they need :) 10 book reviews: I ordinarily avoid very commercial-looking picture books like this one, but my girls have been really interested in mermaids so I decided we would give this book a try. Unfortunately, the rhyme scheme did not quite work for me, and the focus was more on designing ways to capture the mermaid than on actually spending time with her. (I also thought it was weird for people to be trying to capture a creature that is at least half-human and looks like a person from the waist up. I feel weird thinking about the dignity of a mermaid, but it felt odd to me.) Good mermaid books are hard to find; alas, this book does not alleviate that difficulty.  11 book reviews: This is a adorable little book that kids will enjoy. Not because its easy to understand but because the artwork is so bright and vivid. How to Catch a Mermaid, is exactly what the title says it is. You go on this fantastical adventure of how to, yes, catch a mermaid. Its a very sweet story for first time readers and I would recommend it if they are just starting out to learn to read. It 's not complex, its not wordy. It 's just perfect for a reading newcomer. 12 book reviews: These kids try to catch a mermaid and keep her like a pet but the mermaid ends up saving both kids. The concept is a little strange considering that mermaids are half human and keeping them against their volition is considered slavery. Nevertheless, it 's a cute story if you do not think about the moral of it logically. 13 book reviews: May 's Wheel of TBR 2022 Prompt: Read a short book 14 book reviews: Mermaids do not want to be caught lol.   15 book reviews: #14 of 2021  Lovely illustrations! The story was cute, but it needed something. Maybe less rhyming? I ca not describe it, maybe just not my style. 16 book reviews: 3,5  ( Para que atrapar a una sirena?

LEER COMPLETO EN MI BLOG:  18 book reviews: ***Actual Star Rating: 1.5***  At this point there are so many books that include fantastical creatures that are geared for adults as well as children that I was hoping this would be one of them. Unfortunately it was not and is most definitely a children 's book while part of an ongoing series that at this time I do not feel like pursuing to see how the other books compare.  In this particular tale the reader starts off meeting a little girl who says she has seen a mermaid, knows her to be true and wants to catch her so that way she has a new friend. She then continues to explain what she would do with this captured friend before enlisting the help of a boy and dog to help her reach this goal. And the escapades follow after that.  First of all the writing is easy-to-read and understand while rhymes so would most definitely attract much younger readers. There are certain words on each page that are made to stand out from the rest of the text but they did not seem to have any importance or theme to them, which is a bit confusing as to that change-up being included.  The illustrations are brightly colored and quite detailed although you never get to see the mermaid 's face and you can see through the hair on her back that she has a top on. Unfortunately for the illustrations this is a book that is meant to be enjoyed physically since the page illustrations are continuous for the two-page spread so with a digital read that does not share the pages side-by-side you are missing out on the whole scope of the artwork.  And now the but.... The .5 star rating was for the above reasons but to me this book would honestly have received a one-star rating for two reasons. First of all what type of person is taught to capture a friend instead of asking them to be one and then the narrator would blindly hope that imprisoned friend would escort them merrily off to their city? Such poppycock even when you must emphasize your conquest as being fishy!  Then second we are to demonize sharks and make them the villain although clearly this ragtag group off to try their trapping techniques clearly are not.  All in all it can be a cute story for children if you overlook the darker aspects of the story and one that may be quite fun to read to them. But as for me, myself and I, I am going to steer clear of other similar books from this author.  19 book reviews: I received a digital review copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review A story told in rhyming verse about two kids who go on an adventure in an attempt to catch a mermaid. The illustrations are very cute and use vivid, beautiful colors. While the verse is simple and fun, there were several places where it flowed very awkwardly. Overall, a fun, humorous story. 20 book reviews: I read this with my five year old son and two year old daughter this morning before taking my son to school.  The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous. This is a tale of two clever kids and a dog trying their best to catch an equally clever mermaid. The elusive mermaid keeps escaping the traps set to lure her in but when the friends find themselves in danger, the mermaid shows up to save the day!  21 book reviews: This was not as good as  How to Catch a Unicorn  but my daughter liked it. I think she is definitely more of a fan of unicorns than mermaids and I felt like the words in this book did not have as good sentence fluency. 22 book reviews:  Hola lectores!

I would really like to catch her so she could be my friend. \"  So begins the tale of ... \"how to.\"  This little girl yearns to encounter a real mermaid so she can tour mermaid city with her and swim for days and days. She invites her friend to come join her team and together they plan out a mermaid-catching scheme.  Their imaginations and creativity are ignited because nothing like this has ever been done before. Do you know of anyone who has tried to catch a mermaid? I sure do not. Mermaids are streamlined and move fast and they can disappear in the wink of an eye so their plan will have to be clever, smart and sneaky. Then... gotch ya!  This wonderful rhyming book is written by New York Bestselling author Adam Wallace and the illustrations by Andy Elkerton are amazing. The pictures are vibrant, packed full of action and detail and very expressive. They insert the reader right into the pages of the story and animate the narrative perfectly. I love them!  Kids will adore this underwater adventure as their imaginations ignite to try and figure out how in the world a mermaid can be caught. I love books that stretch kid 's minds into the realm of the make-believe and wonder. I highly recommend this book.  24 book reviews: In this book, a young girl and boy, and also a dog, adventure to find and catch a mermaid in the water. They come up with ideas to bait the mermaid toward them. They think of a jewelry box, crown, and a necklace. However, they cannot seem to catch the mermaid despite the lures working. The kids are then chased by sharks, but the mermaid comes to save them with her siren, and she helps them back to shore. Although the group did not get to catch a mermaid, they did get to meet one. This would be a great read aloud book for elementary students, as every other line rhymes with each other. As I read the story myself, I got into a rhythm on each page of how I would read it to children. It is actually quite catchy and also has some larger vocabulary that would be good to introduce to children such as; \"scheme\" or \"courageous.\" The illustrations in this book seem to be digitally created, which makes them seem more life-like than other books. There is lots of color and detail for the reader to look at which is one of things I think makes this book engaging. I also enjoyed that in specific words on each page, Wallace writes them in different fonts, sizes, and colors, to make them stand out. For example, the word \"scary\" is written in green and a font to resemble wooden boards; and the word \"sparkly\" literally has a sparkle coming off the word.  25 book reviews: summary- you as the reader are asked to help the girl try to catch a mermaid. It 's not something that you learn in school, you must first make a gentle trap by the tide shore. You will put a crown in a trap and when she goes to grab it the trap will fly over her. You know this because mermaids love shiny things. But will this work? Will you be able to catch the mermaid or will she be too fast and smart for you. As you read this book, help the girl try to catch the mermaid with all the tips and tricks that you know.  evaluation- this is a very cute book for younger girls that have an interest in mermaids. It helps them follow along in an investigation as well as makes them infer as to what they think will happen next. They are guessing the entire book until the end to see if they were able to catch a mermaid or not.  teaching point- although this is fantasy this allows the reader to develop their imagination and create different ways as to how they will catch the mermaid. They are using their reading skills the entire book as well as their investigation skills where they will continue to keep trying to catch the mermaid.  26 book reviews: I am always excited to see what book Adam Wallace comes up with next. His \"How to Catch...\" series is so much fun. With topics that appeal to kids, and characters that coincide with holidays, his creativity always shines through. We will continue to add to our collection in the library everytime he releases another book from the series. Kids love them.  Will our character be able to catch the mermaid that she saw? What if she tries to lure her with a treasure chest? A sparkly necklace? A crown? Read to find out if the mermaid falls for the trap!  Kids love this series. They are short and fun. Told in rhyme, Adam Wallace always finds a way to be creative with his characters and their antics. In the classroom, this would be a good book for a STEM lesson. What kind of trap would you try to create to catch a mermaid? It would definitely need to be a different kind of trap than you would need to catch say, a turkey, or the tooth fairy. This is also a good book to use for: begin with the end in mind (make a plan), and writing a how-to story. Cute.   27 book reviews: All questions answered by my 4 year old  Do you like this book? Yeah! It has mermaids!  What 's your favorite part of the book? When they tried to catch the mermaid with sparkly stuff but she swam so FAST!  What do you think of the cover? It 's so pretty! It has a mermaid and it 's underwater!  Do you want me to read it again? Yeah!  Momma thinks... This was a super cute book about a couple little kids who decide they want to try to catch a mermaid. They do everything they can, using shiny and sparkly objects, but the mermaid is just too fast for them!  The format of this book was super weird on my kindle, so it was kind of hard to read. But the artwork is beautiful and colorful and the words rhyme, which is always fun.  I wish it was just a bit longer too, but I almost feel like some of the pages are missing from this version, because it kind of just jumps into the book.  We received an ARC version of this book in exchange for an honest review.  28 book reviews: Como siempre la calidad de los libros de la editorial picarona es indiscutible, desde la portada en pasta dura hasta las hermosas ilustraciones, todo refleja calidad y un amor por los libros.  No estoy muy segura sobre que pensar de la trama en s , ya que estoy acostumbrada a encontrar una moraleja o ense anza en cada libro infantil que leo de picarona, pero en esta ocasi n no lo hay o me paso de largo por que no percib  que la historia en si intentara mostrar un aprendizaje (si estoy equivocada corr janme por favor).  Otra cosa que llamo mi atenci n es el hecho de que la trama en si me resulta discutible, es una idea adorable pero no me gusta la idea de que los ni os crezcan pensando que pueden ir por el mundo capturando animales o en este caso sirenas. Tal vez es por que soy defensora del mundo animal y creo que estos deben vivir libres lo que me cre  un debate interno mientras le a este peque o libro.  Esa es mi opini n, pero como siempre digo, lean el libro y juzguen ustedes mismos.   RESE A COMPLETA EN MI BLOG:    29 book reviews: A young girl really wants to catch a mermaid, so they can be friends and explore the ocean together. The girl enlists the help of one of her friends, to help her pull off this daring feat. They try various things, a treasure chest as bait, a sparkly crown and even music, but nothing succeeds in capturing the illusive magical creature. When the two friends are cornered by sharks, the mermaid comes to their rescue. They never do catch her, but we are treated to a rollicking journey under the sea.  Unlike How to Catch a Unicorn, in this book, you hardly see the mermaid at all, and you never see her face. She is not on most pages, unlike the unicorn who was on every one. It is a bit of a let down, but I suppose it adds to the mystery.  The illustrations in this book are no less gorgeous. The underwater world is beautifully portrayed.  ",
    " How to Catch a Unicorn": "book reviews: The How to Catch series is popular in our house. This is about a unicorn so the niece wanted to read this herself.  There is a group of children at the zoo and a unicorn is visiting her friends there when the children spot her. The kids begin setting traps for the unicorn and all the animals help her get free. The best, in my opinion, was when there was a rope to pull a trap shut and the snakes were on the rope so that the kids wouldn t touch them.  It s cute and simple. The art is like cotton candy. I do appreciate the glitter on the cover and the rainbows all throughout the book to see where the unicorn is. These books are simple, but they have a purpose and it works. It was rather boring for me, but it s not written for me either.  The nephew loved this book. He thought it was fun. He loved the zoo setting and he thought the traps for the unicorn could have been better and more elaborate like with the tooth fairy. He gave this 4 stars and wants more. The niece thought it was sort of silly, but she liked it too. She gave this 3 stars.  1 book reviews:   Happy Unicorn Day!    This was everything I want in a unicorn book! It was a fun read and the illustrations were bright and colourful, with plenty of glitter and rainbows (plus the requisite reference to unicorn flatulence). From ice cream traps to butterfly nets, a group of kids try their best to catch a wiley unicorn through the zoo s exhibits but this unicorn has a host of animal friends ready to help it evade capture.  I smiled my way through this book and particularly loved  s illustrations. I enjoyed the various expressions on the kids  faces when their attempts to catch the unicorn didn t quite go to plan. My favourite near miss resulted in a couple of kids getting soaked by some penguins. I couldn t choose a favourite animal because they re all amazing; they re full of joy and adorably cheeky as they foil the kids  plan.  I really appreciated the creative substitution of the unicorn horn and star for the  i  in the book s title. Oftentimes it s the little extras that make a book memorable long term for me and it wouldn t surprise me if that sparkly yellow  i  is one of the things that find its way into my spontaneous recommendation to some unsuspecting book store visitor weeks or months from now.  I ve read this book three times (so far) and plan to read it every day until I have no choice but to return it to the library. I previously fell in love with , which I reviewed . Now it s a given that I need to get my hands on the rest of  s series.   2 book reviews: Poor unicorn. Always being chased and never able to just hangout and have fun.  The art is awesome, the rhyming text has an easy cadence and the story is cute.  Definitely something we will enjoy adding to our collection.  3 book reviews: This was okay. The rhyming text is very forced--it really adds nothing to the story and the cadence is working at cross purposes with the pacing of the story. The artwork is hyper stylized in a way that I find off putting and there is some weird text design happening where one word on every page is HIGHLIGHTED by being in a different font or color. But there is not any method to which word it is. Fun for unicorn superfans but not one I will be putting into my storytime rotation. 4 book reviews: Taj, age 5: I like this book so much and I didn t know that I would like it so much.  Harper, age 7: I would give it 3 stars because the cover says  How to Catch a Unicorn  but it s not telling you steps, it s just telling a story of how they don t catch a unicorn. But also, I like that she has glitter trails that follow her everywhere. 5 book reviews: The unicorn seemed to be attracted to every trap for not actually wanting to be caught. Kind of annoying. 6 book reviews: This book gave absolutely no information on how to catch a unicorn. At best, this is a guide on how NOT to catch one. 0/10 would not recommend. 7 book reviews: It 's glittery and sparkly and about unicorns. The kids here have no success in catching the unicorn with the various plans and shenanigans, but unicorn loving young readers will have fun watching them try. 8 book reviews: Very magical. Good information about how to NOT catch a unicorn, sprinkled in with some interesting fun facts about the horned horses.  (My cousins loved this book.) 9 book reviews: Cute pics, but the rhymes felt forced. My child was not impressed, but she did like the \"farting glitter\" bit. 10 book reviews: Beware of this book. It causes uncontrollable giggling and endless talk of glitter farts. Your kids might trash the house setting up unicorn traps.  (A group of kids try catching a unicorn. Unicorn escapes. Lots of silliness.) 11 book reviews: If you are looking for a really fun book to read to your kids you have found it. Not only is it a catch me if you can, it also exposes the readers to different animals at the zoo too. The cunning unicorn is a real hoot! Just when the kids think they ve caught the unicorn, it outsmarts them at every turn. The size of the book is easy for a younger kid to handle easily and I predict that this will be their go-to book for quite some time. I loved how the unicorn is never fully in sight which builds the readers anticipation throughout the book. It is a very engaging book for storytime or bedtime.  Elkerson s illustrations are a rainbow of color and simply striking on the page. The detail is amazing. Kids will be captivated by all the pretty colors. The text is beautifully written. Its size and location on the page are very easy to follow. I m so glad that I pick this book up at the library. It didn t disappoint at all. There s no way you can read this and not have the biggest smile on your face when you re done.  12 book reviews: What my kid   Loved: The colors and the unicorn on every page. How my kid  Felt: Happy, about the pictures, but a bit confused about the story. To Read   or   Not To Read: It 's a beautiful book, but the traps set by the kids at the zoo are hard to explain to the kid you are reading to because they are not described in the book.   The book follows a unicorn visiting a zoo. The visiting children think they can catch it. Each page visits another zoo animal that helps the unicorn escape a trap set by the children. My daughter 's favorite part was the last page where we see the unicorn 's face for the first time.  13 book reviews: Definitely my least favorite of the \"How to Catch...\" series. Mostly because I volunteer at a zoo and I loathe the depiction of the zoo in this book. All the exhibits were bare concrete with metal gates. Has Wallace been to a zoo in the last decade?!? Zoos are not like that anymore!  I did think that the rhyming was cute but the text threw me a little since all the other books in the series are told from the perspective of the kids trying to catch the creature but this one is written as the unicorn is talking.  Shame. Unicorns are so in right now.  Note: I accessed a digital review copy of this book through Edelweiss.  14 book reviews: For more reviews, check out my blog: Craft-Cycle  Overall, a fun, engaging read, perfect for young unicorn-lovers.  I most enjoyed the fun and colorful details in the illustrations. All of the trap designs were interesting and it was neat to see how the animal friends helped prevent the unicorn from getting caught.  I also thought the rhyming was good. It had a nice rhythm to it and gave the book a nice flow in my opinion.  A silly book filled with cuteness and magic.  15 book reviews: Fourth star just for all the colors and glitter and cute snacks! I also love the raised text and glitter on the cover--great texture.  A rhyming romp through the zoo, where a group of kids are hot on the unicorn 's trail, but the zoo animals help the unicorn escape!  I love the kid in the unicorn shirt--he 's just freaking out the whole time. Reminded me of me (not that I am a chipper person, but I can get really excited about stuff I like).  16 book reviews: My grand daughter absolutely loves this book!! I borrowed it from the library and read it to her so many times that I finally had to purchase a book for her to keep. I am a children 's librarian as well and the children love this book. We can not keep it on the shelves. I do not know what the critics are thinking. It is meant to be fun and silly. It is a children 's book after all and children seem to really enjoy reading it over and over. 17 book reviews: A group of fast thinking kids try to catch a unicorn at the zoo. However, the animals at the zoo may be helping out the Unicorn. Wait and find out!  The big cats, the nocturnals, the reptiles, even the butterfly house try to help out.  My favorite trap is the petting zoo!  Very fun read and great for creative thinking! Andy 's illustrations are perfect with Wallace 's couplet style writing.  Great for read aloud. Would be an awesome storytime at the zoo!  18 book reviews: Colourful picture book that Miss 5 liked basically because it involved a unicorn!  Miss 5 and I like to explore different books and authors at the library, sometimes around particular topics or themes. We try to get different ones out every week or so; it 's fun for both of us to have the variety and to look at a mix of new & favourite authors. 19 book reviews: I wanted to like this book, but I found it to be way too campy. I can understand why young children might like it (trying to be tricky, the traps they set, etc.) but I would not pick this up to share it with anyone. 20 book reviews: The unicorn decides to visit his friends the animals at the zoo. A group of children try various traps to catch him, but fail due to the zoo animals help. The illustrations are darling, but the wording doesn t flow easily. 21 book reviews: It 's a cute story but I was expecting more of a guide on catching unicorns versus the failed attempts you get here. This is more a narrative by the unicorn on how it evades the children. All in all my daughter will love this book when she opens it on her birthday. 22 book reviews: *I read a digital ARC of this title from the publisher via Edelweiss. 23 book reviews: Not what I expected. The title should really be something like \"How Not to catch a Unicorn\".  It has some cute elements, but overall not anything unusual or impressive. 24 book reviews: Cute, but after reading it to 4 year old over and over and over again...it wears out quickly. 25 book reviews: Things I liked: unicorn colorful and pretty \"farting glitter\"  Things I did not like: rhymes mean kids trying too hard to push diversity (enough already, I get it)  26 book reviews: I loved the illustrations...they were very engaging. It 's a cute, whimsical story. 27 book reviews: Trying to catch this colorful creature proves difficult throughout this fun book. Each page kept our attention as we journeyed along, trying to catch a unicorn. 28 book reviews: This is a rhyming story with colorful illustrations. It is kind of silly but kids might like it. Reading level is K-2. 29 book reviews: Kids try to set traps to catch a unicorn, but the unicorn cleverly escapes each time. ",
    " Human Body Activity Book for Kids: Hands-On Fun for Grades K-3": "book reviews: Children have an insatiable curiosity and are constantly looking for new things. They learn best when things are interesting and fun. Stokes has crafted a book which satisfies both of these needs. She has put together a collection of fun facts about the body and has added games and activities to make it attractive to kids. What s more she has done it in a way which help those adults who are trying desperately to help their children understand the world around them.  The human body is incredible and sometimes awe inspiring in its intricacies and details. The Human Body Activity Book for Kids takes a child through the different major parts of the body step by step. The pictures and breakdown of the various body parts is truly impressive. Stokes tries the answer the basic questions and satisfies the general curiosity a child would have about their body and how it works.  This is an excellent book for anyone who has small children or who works with them. As adults we often are stymied when children ask us questions. We don t know where to begin. Well, here you have a systematic approach which will help anyone faced with this dilemma with regards to helping children with their bodies.  The book is intuitive enough so that children can move through it themselves with little or no help from the adults in their life. They will have fun and the adults will be relieved that they do not need to spend a lot of time researching for information they don t have, to satisfy their child s curiosity. It s all here, no need to look further.  1 book reviews: Whilst a kindergartener will most likely just look through this book at all the colorful pages, a second to third grader should be capable of doing the activities and reading all the details. Whilst a lot of information is presented in this book, it is done in an easy-to-understand way and interesting. There are lots of fun facts (Top 5 in each section) that kids will likely absorb and remember. There are also a plethora of \"Try This at Home\" experiments.  This activity book is VERY colorful. The diagrams are very clearly labelled. Activities (mazes, word searches, coloring etc.) are easy to understand with ample space left for completion if applicable. At the end you will find resources and an index. There are NO gender specifics (private parts) mentioned or shown in this body so very suitable for young children. Yes, some of the diagrams are of boys and girls but no individual parts are shown. This book is about muscles, bones, blood, heart, eyes and so much more.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. It is one, that once completed, can be kept as a resource and for refreshing memories. Yes, I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher but that has not influenced my review. Thanks, Liz  2 book reviews: The book for review Is  Human Body Activity Book For Kids  by Katie Stokes, M.Ed., Ph.D. It falls in the genre of juvenile non fiction and anatomy according to the publishers.  What are the parts of the body? How many taste buds does a human being have? Why do we have two ears? Why are we the way we are?  The Human Body Activity Book for Kids is a fun activity book for kids in the age range from K-3 to learn about their own body.  Inside the pages you will learn about one s cells, the skeleton, your muscles, your brain and nervous system and all the way up to how you hear, how you smell, your digestive system and the immune system  Each section has drawings of the human body that references the topic that is being discussed. They are colorful and informational. There are activities and exercises for the kids to do to reinforce what was just discussed.  There are so many facts listed that were pretty interesting to read about even though I m not a kid. The drawings were really cool and kids should enjoy them.  Let s face it the human body is a complex subject with so much going on. This book helps break down the parts and written for kids that is easy to understand and fun to learn.  I received this book for free from Callisto Publishing in exchange for an honest review.  3 book reviews: This activity-laden book about the human body is very informative. Although it does contain some \"fun\" activities like mazes and word search puzzles, its focus is definitely on educating kids about how their bodies work!  The book is filled with fun facts about our bodies (for instance, I did NOT know that the acid in our stomachs is also found in some industrial cleaners - I guess this explains why acid reflux wreaks such havoc on our bodies!) The colorful images throughout will captivate your kid 's attention, and the diverse illustrations used throughout are an educational plus.  The book is rated for Grades K through 3, but this book is probably more suited for older kids than younger ones.  I received a copy of this book from the Callisto Publisher 's Club but this did not in any way influence my opinion.  4 book reviews: \"The Human Body Activity Book for Kids\", by Katie Stokes, M.Ed., Ph.D., gives young readers the inside scoop on the inside of the human body. Written and illustrated for children grades K-3, this is the complete head-to-toe guide to the inner works of the inner body. This fun and educational book is filled with activities and hands-on experiments, fun facts, and colorful, detailed drawings that keep modesty in mind. The \"Top 5 Fun Facts\" in each section are interesting for both children and adults. As the author says: \"Children learn best when they are having fun.\" Knowledge is empowering, and encouraging curious young minds opens up their world. The universe is theirs,  Book Copy Callisto Publishers  5 book reviews: I requested this book from Callisto Publisher 's Club for my four year old who is just a sponge for learning. She has recently discovered Doc McStuffins and has been playing doctor with the entire family for months. She 's always so curious and wants to know more so when I saw this, I was over the moon! The first day we got it we went over quite a few pages just reading and learning together. It was completely adorable listening to her tell her dad and teen siblings all about muscles, bones, veins and more. Over the next few days we continued to go over the book together and while I think it will be a learning experience for years to come I do not think she will be bored of it any time soon.  6 book reviews: I received this book from the publisher for review. I really like this book. I handed it to my 10 year old and she loves it. The activities are quite easy for her but she loves the information provided. She is very curious. I think that the k-3 age range may be to limiting. It is full of good information though and the pictures are very realistic. They are not revealing in the least. Nothing on the reproductive system at this point so in that aspect the age range is good. Younger children will need help with some of the words. Over all very informative.  7 book reviews: Super cool! Lots of fun activities and lessons and diagrams to really explain all the body systems and functions and fun facts. I used with my kids and in my after school programs. Excellent book. They loved the word searches and other activities in this. I would just make copies. 8 book reviews: Got this for my kiddos to learn about the human anatomy because we are home school this year. The kids love the interaction in this book. I highly recommend it. 9 book reviews: This is a great book because Dr. Stokes included image of children from different ethnicities. Her foreword is excellent. She offers great advice. 10 book reviews: How absolutely fascinating for a young reader to visually take in the complex, inner workings of a human body - without it being too exhaustive. Muscles, bones, veins, and more, my kids did not want to put this one down! The activities provided in this book made understanding and remembering the facts even more fun. 11 book reviews: This is one that gets asked to be read and reread a lot. Ages five on up to fifth or sixth grade. A beautiful book that should be in every curriculum + every library. Fun activities and short and easy to remember fun facts about the body. Love it! 12 book reviews: All the writing prompts, worksheets and activities can be found for free online without this book. The illustrations are great and so is the resource list in the back. Definitely high for a kindergarten student but not impossible. Better designed for third graders. ",

    " I Love You to the Moon and Back": "book name: If Animals Kissed Good Night 0 book reviews: My grandson is into elephants now, so he finally let me read this last night and wanted to take it to bed with him.   If I could be an animal, guess I would be a sloth ... because they are so lazy, their kisses last from the beginning to the end of the book.   But what about the turtles?!   Hmmmm... Think I need to go back and read it again... 1 book reviews: going out of my way to rate one of the baby books i ve read to my baby rumi. this book freakin slaps. id give it 5.5 stars even. like comparatively most baby books appear mid when side by side with this. i ve read my son probably 10 baby books so far and they just don t hold the creativity and joy this one does. he s not even old enough to know what i m saying and he understands how good this book is. i imagine his first words will be    now that i can talk, may we read if animals kissed goodnight again?  and i would tell him  say less, son.   2 book reviews: This is an adorable book, with wonderfully simple drawings, vivid colors, fun rhyming, and a great bedtime theme. The fact that they mixed up all the genders - mommies, daddies, daughters, sons - perfected the experience for me. There is an hilarious recurring theme with the sloths because they take so long for their kiss. My kids and I love to say \"sooooo slooooow\" as low and as long as we can while describing how the sloths kiss good night. Fun and sleep-inducing!! 3 book reviews: Such a wonderful picture book. Would definitely worth reading for children and their parents. 4 book reviews: The Rhymes were well crafted and I could definitely see a song being made out of this. 5 book reviews: Goodnight  6 book reviews: 7 book reviews: Very cute illustrations, fun rhymes, and a variety of animals make this a winning bedtime read, one especially suited for Valentine 's Day. I like the imagination behind the different settings, sounds, etc. the parent/baby animals would make with their goodnight kisses, and the ending illustration is especially adorable and ties in adorably with the author 's note where she mentions she was inspired to write the book based on a little bedtime game she used to play with her own child.  8 book reviews: One of my daughter 's favorites!! It 's so cute. 9 book reviews: I don t know why, but I actually found this book really kind of disturbing. 10 book reviews: A minha opini o sobre \"E se os animais dessem beijinhos de boa noite?\" aqui: https://www.instagram.com/p/CaT9wbVM-DK/  Boas leituras :) 11 book reviews: Read for CBR 6  Today you lovely people get to benefit from my  1) need to provide the newest arrivals in my family with quality children s literature, 2) hatred for gift registries, and 3) understanding of the panic that occurs when tiny babies do not want to go to sleep.  My go-to gift for any occasion is a book. Or many books. I figure you, my fellow Cannonballers, have a similar notion that there is, somewhere in the universe, a perfect book to give as a gift for almost every reason. Good days, bad days, promotions, losses, stubbed toes, missing you moments: Books are good for them all. Not cure-alls, mind you, but just to show you care, to let the person know you re thinking of them, whatever the reason may be. And for actual gift giving days   birthdays, parties, Christmases and the like? Books should be your first response.  So for my cousin s upcoming baby shower, I gave the registry a brief glimpse   too much pink, too little I could actually afford   and happened to see that they d requested the Johnson & Johnson s bath wash that s specifically for bedtime (in that it contains  soothing lavender essence ), and I figured I could work with that. So I put together a little care package of the baby wash, an adorable puppy softie (that is seriously so soft I want to keep it, but won t), and some appropriately soothing bedtime books to add to the new kiddo s routine.  I started with a couple of classics, which I am not going to bother reviewing: if you don t know about the awesome that is Goodnight Moon, I m not sure why you re bothering to read this review at all. Other five-star favorites I included were Sandra Boynton s The Going to Bed Book; Ten, Night, Eight by Molly Bang; and Good Night Gorilla, by Peggy Rathman. (All of these books are in board book form unless I mentioned otherwise, because gnawing on books should just be a given until a kid turns two-ish.)  Next up is Time for Bed, written by Mem Fox & illustrated by Jane Dyer, which came out in 1993, and I consider a staple of bedtime books, but the lady at the bookstore hadn t heard of it (gasp!), so I figure maybe I should extol on its virtues a bit here for those who ve missed out. The short, repetitive & rhyming text ( It s time for bed little goose(animal), little goose(animal); the stars are out and on the loose (rhyme) ) are sweet, cozy and charming. The pictures are water-colored & dreamy, and easily recognizable for older kids, and   while it doesn t have any of the little comic surprises of a Good Night, Gorilla or The Going to Bed Book   the simple, soothing pattern is one that kids tend to memorize quickly and learn to help you  read  early on.  The last three books I chose were new to me:  The first, If Animals Kissed Good Night, by Ann Whitford Paul, with entertaining illustrations by David Walker, drew me in because of the adorable elephants on the cover, and works as a good companion to Time for Bed, as it goes through different animals and their progeny (bear and a cub, seal and a calf, parrot and chick, etc.) and how they might say good night. It s more Suessian & playful   with its  splashity-splishes  and  mud-happy heaps , but no less soothing or snuggly.  Hush Little Polar Bear, by Jeff Mack, is about the adventures a sleeping stuffed polar bear   and his little girl   might get into in their dreams. All the  bouncing through pastures  and  creeping through caves  are lovingly drawn and the fuzzy bear somehow manages to safely navigate his way back to imagining that he s safe and sound with the little girl, all tucked into bed, book laid out on top of the sheets. It s cute, and it s a little bit different from the others in that it s neither a book about a specific routine (10,9,8 or Goodnight Moon, i.e.) or a book about imagined routines (all the rest). Dreams and adventures definitely need to have some space in the bedtime book line-up. (It s more along the lines of a Harold and the Purple Crayon.)  Last   and the only non-board book, because I don t think there is one   is Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site, by Sherri Duskey Rinker and Tom Lichtenheld. I bought it specifically because my cousin is an architect and works at construction sites a lot, so his little girl should know about them, eventually. The book goes through all different pieces of equipment and what they do   crane truck, cement mixer, dump truck, etc   and then has them slowly ending their day and going to sleep, with a gentle rhyme & and a brightly colored illustration    He lowers his bed, locks his gate; Rests his wheels; it s getting late. He dims his lights, then shuts his doors, and soon his engine slows to snores. Shh  goodnight, Dump Truck, goodnight.   There you have it: Baby s first bedtime books, which stop here only because I ran out of money. (Given a bit more funding I would also include: Roar of a Snore; The Napping House; Steam Train, Dream Train; Moon Dreams ; Llama, llama Red Pajama; The Dream Jar; I Love You, Stinky Face)  12 book reviews: This is a good book to read when you haven t hit your reading goal on the last day of the year. Approximately 5 min read. Highly recommend. 13 book reviews: So cute, adorable and fun to read! Baby kicked while I read it so I take that as a good sign :) 14 book reviews: I think this is a good book for children with the rhyming and different animals, but as an adult reading this to a child it was not great. I guess recommend if you can find this for cheap. 15 book reviews: This is one of my favorite books. My Mama said I loved it so much that I ate it! I do not remember that, but I have a new copy and it 's still a favorite bedtime story. I like that I am learning about animals and I like how the sloth and her cub kiss sooo slooow! I also like the pictures 16 book reviews: I love the illustrations, as I love David Walker from Bears on Chairs, but I am not crazy about the words within. Not awful, but not fabulous either, just ok. 17 book reviews: I have read this approximately a thousand times at bedtime, and I still like it. 18 book reviews: A lovely nighttime routine book. My favorite thing about this is the running joke about sloths, who make regular appearances throughout the entire as they slowly kiss. 19 book reviews: Threw it in the trash. It s for Pedos to groom kids. 20 book reviews: This is a one and done for our family. Tones of creepiness plague this book. 21 book reviews: My 8yo laughed at the sloths through this book   22 book reviews: Ann Whitford Paul s story, If Animals Kissed Goodnight, explores the different ways animals kiss their mothers or fathers goodnight. Sloths would kiss slow, bears would kiss then growl, rhinos would kiss with a tip-tap of their horns, monkeys would swing in for kiss from branch to branch, and many more. Paul draws the reader in with exciting onamonapias like  klick-a-klack  and bright colors. The rhythm and rhymes are soothing for bedtime, putting any child right to sleep, or at least close to it. The story is encouraging to young readers that even animals need to say goodnight. Many young children kiss their parents goodnight, making the story a reinforcement of this bedtime routine through the silly idea that even animals do it. The nursery rhymes we have examined in past classes are similar to this story, as both stories employ rhyme and rhythm that help a child listen to the story better. For example,  Hey Diddle Diddle  ascribes human characteristics to animals through rhyme and rhythm, much like the animals in Paul s story. They are doing such bizarre things that animals would normally never do, like in Paul s story kissing goodnight, and in  Hey Diddle Diddle  the little dog laughs.  23 book reviews: This is a non-fiction book, a New York Times Best Selling Book which is intended for ages Newborn- 3 years old. This book is about many different animals and each animals habits and the sounds each animal makes when moving and \"kissing\" there babies goodnight. It explores all kinds of animals from the ocean to the rainforest, it shows how each animal shows affection to each other. I rated this book 5 stars because it is the cutest book to show to any little one! The colors and the way the font is enlarged to highlight the sounds each animal makes, it really helps the story and to tell what is going on through each page. It pairs the sound with each animal to help the children start to say or learn to say those different animal noises. Young readers would love this story showing each other how animals make sounds this is a great book for babies as well to show them how we can start to make sounds to communicate. I would use this book when working with children to have them start pairing what sound each animal makes and being able to identify the animals by what they look or sound like. Even with words and/or actual sounds!  24 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night is about a child that wonders how different animals would kiss good night to their families. On each page, there are different animals and it explains how they would each kiss good night. It shows the different ways that they would share their unique love.  The overall theme of this book is love because it explains the way that animals would kiss each other good night. The message is very heart warming because all the animals differ in the way they say goodnight, but they all love each other.  I really enjoyed reading this children s book. It made me happy inside, and it reminded me of when my mom or dad would tuck me into bed when I was younger.  I would for sure recommend this book to be in all the homes of young children. The illustrations are very well drawn drawn, and the author did a great job at explaining the ways that animals say good night.  25 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night is an adorable poetry book that ponders the question, do animals kiss good night like we do? Sloths, peacocks, snakes, walruses, elephants, parrots, wolves, bears, monkeys, seals, penguins, rhinos, giraffes, kangaroos, and hippos, are illustrated in the different ways that they kiss goodnight. They do a fan dance, klick-klack their beaks, howl and growl, and even blow big, bubbled kisses. This book would be great for early childhood students because of its rhyming cadence and the overall theme. The illustrations are similar to books written for infants or early childhood aged children. They look to be chalk pastels or watercolor and they give the feeling of a lighthearted book for small children. I also really liked that the names for the baby animals are included, such as calfs or cubs. This would be very helpful for students who are learning about animals and different animal names.  26 book reviews: 27 book reviews: I was read this when I used to have a hard time falling asleep at night so since I had fond memories of it, I decided to reread it again as an adult. This simple book explains how different animals would kiss goof night. For example, the  Would and his pup would kiss and then HOWL! . Although, I liked it when I was younger, I do not think this is the best book for kids since it doesn t teach a lesson, nor does it have very many literary elements incorporated into it. Despite this, it could be a relaxing book for those who are high energy due to its playful art, rhymed verse, and sweet tone. I would not use this in a classroom, but it could be useful to a young child who is just learning vocabulary and words. Moreover, it could help them with memorization.  28 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night by Ann Whitford Paul has not won any awards but it was a finalist for the SCIBA book award. This book is great for pre-K to kindergarten. This book is about if animals kissed goodnight. Its about how they would do it. Also, it shows the relationship between the mother/father and the child animal before bedtime. This book was fun and cute. It brought some creativity into the event of bedtime. It also is heart warming. This book would be great to bring some family time into the classroom. You can discuss what your favorite thing to do before bedtime is. Also. the students can create their own stories.  29 book reviews: If Animals Kiss Goodnight is a children s poetry book geared towards kids ages three through six. It hasn t won any awards but it was a finalist for the SCIBA book award.  This story imagine how different animals would kiss their loved ones good night.  If Animals Kissed Goodnight is an adorable book with bright colors and simple drawings. It rhymes and in my opinion is a great bedtime story. It isn t the type of book to read to a class or to gain information from, but it is fun for young children as there is a hilarious reoccurring theme with the sloths and how long they take to kiss. I also like that they mixed up the genders and family style/dynamics to add some depth to the story.  ",
    " If Animals Kissed Good Night": "book reviews: My grandson is into elephants now, so he finally let me read this last night and wanted to take it to bed with him.   If I could be an animal, guess I would be a sloth ... because they are so lazy, their kisses last from the beginning to the end of the book.   But what about the turtles?!   Hmmmm... Think I need to go back and read it again... 1 book reviews: going out of my way to rate one of the baby books i ve read to my baby rumi. this book freakin slaps. id give it 5.5 stars even. like comparatively most baby books appear mid when side by side with this. i ve read my son probably 10 baby books so far and they just don t hold the creativity and joy this one does. he s not even old enough to know what i m saying and he understands how good this book is. i imagine his first words will be    now that i can talk, may we read if animals kissed goodnight again?  and i would tell him  say less, son.   2 book reviews: This is an adorable book, with wonderfully simple drawings, vivid colors, fun rhyming, and a great bedtime theme. The fact that they mixed up all the genders - mommies, daddies, daughters, sons - perfected the experience for me. There is an hilarious recurring theme with the sloths because they take so long for their kiss. My kids and I love to say \"sooooo slooooow\" as low and as long as we can while describing how the sloths kiss good night. Fun and sleep-inducing!! 3 book reviews: Such a wonderful picture book. Would definitely worth reading for children and their parents. 4 book reviews: The Rhymes were well crafted and I could definitely see a song being made out of this. 5 book reviews: Goodnight  6 book reviews: 7 book reviews: Very cute illustrations, fun rhymes, and a variety of animals make this a winning bedtime read, one especially suited for Valentine 's Day. I like the imagination behind the different settings, sounds, etc. the parent/baby animals would make with their goodnight kisses, and the ending illustration is especially adorable and ties in adorably with the author 's note where she mentions she was inspired to write the book based on a little bedtime game she used to play with her own child.  8 book reviews: One of my daughter 's favorites!! It 's so cute. 9 book reviews: I don t know why, but I actually found this book really kind of disturbing. 10 book reviews: A minha opini o sobre \"E se os animais dessem beijinhos de boa noite?\" aqui: https://www.instagram.com/p/CaT9wbVM-DK/  Boas leituras :) 11 book reviews: Read for CBR 6  Today you lovely people get to benefit from my  1) need to provide the newest arrivals in my family with quality children s literature, 2) hatred for gift registries, and 3) understanding of the panic that occurs when tiny babies do not want to go to sleep.  My go-to gift for any occasion is a book. Or many books. I figure you, my fellow Cannonballers, have a similar notion that there is, somewhere in the universe, a perfect book to give as a gift for almost every reason. Good days, bad days, promotions, losses, stubbed toes, missing you moments: Books are good for them all. Not cure-alls, mind you, but just to show you care, to let the person know you re thinking of them, whatever the reason may be. And for actual gift giving days   birthdays, parties, Christmases and the like? Books should be your first response.  So for my cousin s upcoming baby shower, I gave the registry a brief glimpse   too much pink, too little I could actually afford   and happened to see that they d requested the Johnson & Johnson s bath wash that s specifically for bedtime (in that it contains  soothing lavender essence ), and I figured I could work with that. So I put together a little care package of the baby wash, an adorable puppy softie (that is seriously so soft I want to keep it, but won t), and some appropriately soothing bedtime books to add to the new kiddo s routine.  I started with a couple of classics, which I am not going to bother reviewing: if you don t know about the awesome that is Goodnight Moon, I m not sure why you re bothering to read this review at all. Other five-star favorites I included were Sandra Boynton s The Going to Bed Book; Ten, Night, Eight by Molly Bang; and Good Night Gorilla, by Peggy Rathman. (All of these books are in board book form unless I mentioned otherwise, because gnawing on books should just be a given until a kid turns two-ish.)  Next up is Time for Bed, written by Mem Fox & illustrated by Jane Dyer, which came out in 1993, and I consider a staple of bedtime books, but the lady at the bookstore hadn t heard of it (gasp!), so I figure maybe I should extol on its virtues a bit here for those who ve missed out. The short, repetitive & rhyming text ( It s time for bed little goose(animal), little goose(animal); the stars are out and on the loose (rhyme) ) are sweet, cozy and charming. The pictures are water-colored & dreamy, and easily recognizable for older kids, and   while it doesn t have any of the little comic surprises of a Good Night, Gorilla or The Going to Bed Book   the simple, soothing pattern is one that kids tend to memorize quickly and learn to help you  read  early on.  The last three books I chose were new to me:  The first, If Animals Kissed Good Night, by Ann Whitford Paul, with entertaining illustrations by David Walker, drew me in because of the adorable elephants on the cover, and works as a good companion to Time for Bed, as it goes through different animals and their progeny (bear and a cub, seal and a calf, parrot and chick, etc.) and how they might say good night. It s more Suessian & playful   with its  splashity-splishes  and  mud-happy heaps , but no less soothing or snuggly.  Hush Little Polar Bear, by Jeff Mack, is about the adventures a sleeping stuffed polar bear   and his little girl   might get into in their dreams. All the  bouncing through pastures  and  creeping through caves  are lovingly drawn and the fuzzy bear somehow manages to safely navigate his way back to imagining that he s safe and sound with the little girl, all tucked into bed, book laid out on top of the sheets. It s cute, and it s a little bit different from the others in that it s neither a book about a specific routine (10,9,8 or Goodnight Moon, i.e.) or a book about imagined routines (all the rest). Dreams and adventures definitely need to have some space in the bedtime book line-up. (It s more along the lines of a Harold and the Purple Crayon.)  Last   and the only non-board book, because I don t think there is one   is Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site, by Sherri Duskey Rinker and Tom Lichtenheld. I bought it specifically because my cousin is an architect and works at construction sites a lot, so his little girl should know about them, eventually. The book goes through all different pieces of equipment and what they do   crane truck, cement mixer, dump truck, etc   and then has them slowly ending their day and going to sleep, with a gentle rhyme & and a brightly colored illustration    He lowers his bed, locks his gate; Rests his wheels; it s getting late. He dims his lights, then shuts his doors, and soon his engine slows to snores. Shh  goodnight, Dump Truck, goodnight.   There you have it: Baby s first bedtime books, which stop here only because I ran out of money. (Given a bit more funding I would also include: Roar of a Snore; The Napping House; Steam Train, Dream Train; Moon Dreams ; Llama, llama Red Pajama; The Dream Jar; I Love You, Stinky Face)  12 book reviews: This is a good book to read when you haven t hit your reading goal on the last day of the year. Approximately 5 min read. Highly recommend. 13 book reviews: So cute, adorable and fun to read! Baby kicked while I read it so I take that as a good sign :) 14 book reviews: I think this is a good book for children with the rhyming and different animals, but as an adult reading this to a child it was not great. I guess recommend if you can find this for cheap. 15 book reviews: This is one of my favorite books. My Mama said I loved it so much that I ate it! I do not remember that, but I have a new copy and it 's still a favorite bedtime story. I like that I am learning about animals and I like how the sloth and her cub kiss sooo slooow! I also like the pictures 16 book reviews: I love the illustrations, as I love David Walker from Bears on Chairs, but I am not crazy about the words within. Not awful, but not fabulous either, just ok. 17 book reviews: I have read this approximately a thousand times at bedtime, and I still like it. 18 book reviews: A lovely nighttime routine book. My favorite thing about this is the running joke about sloths, who make regular appearances throughout the entire as they slowly kiss. 19 book reviews: Threw it in the trash. It s for Pedos to groom kids. 20 book reviews: This is a one and done for our family. Tones of creepiness plague this book. 21 book reviews: My 8yo laughed at the sloths through this book   22 book reviews: Ann Whitford Paul s story, If Animals Kissed Goodnight, explores the different ways animals kiss their mothers or fathers goodnight. Sloths would kiss slow, bears would kiss then growl, rhinos would kiss with a tip-tap of their horns, monkeys would swing in for kiss from branch to branch, and many more. Paul draws the reader in with exciting onamonapias like  klick-a-klack  and bright colors. The rhythm and rhymes are soothing for bedtime, putting any child right to sleep, or at least close to it. The story is encouraging to young readers that even animals need to say goodnight. Many young children kiss their parents goodnight, making the story a reinforcement of this bedtime routine through the silly idea that even animals do it. The nursery rhymes we have examined in past classes are similar to this story, as both stories employ rhyme and rhythm that help a child listen to the story better. For example,  Hey Diddle Diddle  ascribes human characteristics to animals through rhyme and rhythm, much like the animals in Paul s story. They are doing such bizarre things that animals would normally never do, like in Paul s story kissing goodnight, and in  Hey Diddle Diddle  the little dog laughs.  23 book reviews: This is a non-fiction book, a New York Times Best Selling Book which is intended for ages Newborn- 3 years old. This book is about many different animals and each animals habits and the sounds each animal makes when moving and \"kissing\" there babies goodnight. It explores all kinds of animals from the ocean to the rainforest, it shows how each animal shows affection to each other. I rated this book 5 stars because it is the cutest book to show to any little one! The colors and the way the font is enlarged to highlight the sounds each animal makes, it really helps the story and to tell what is going on through each page. It pairs the sound with each animal to help the children start to say or learn to say those different animal noises. Young readers would love this story showing each other how animals make sounds this is a great book for babies as well to show them how we can start to make sounds to communicate. I would use this book when working with children to have them start pairing what sound each animal makes and being able to identify the animals by what they look or sound like. Even with words and/or actual sounds!  24 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night is about a child that wonders how different animals would kiss good night to their families. On each page, there are different animals and it explains how they would each kiss good night. It shows the different ways that they would share their unique love.  The overall theme of this book is love because it explains the way that animals would kiss each other good night. The message is very heart warming because all the animals differ in the way they say goodnight, but they all love each other.  I really enjoyed reading this children s book. It made me happy inside, and it reminded me of when my mom or dad would tuck me into bed when I was younger.  I would for sure recommend this book to be in all the homes of young children. The illustrations are very well drawn drawn, and the author did a great job at explaining the ways that animals say good night.  25 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night is an adorable poetry book that ponders the question, do animals kiss good night like we do? Sloths, peacocks, snakes, walruses, elephants, parrots, wolves, bears, monkeys, seals, penguins, rhinos, giraffes, kangaroos, and hippos, are illustrated in the different ways that they kiss goodnight. They do a fan dance, klick-klack their beaks, howl and growl, and even blow big, bubbled kisses. This book would be great for early childhood students because of its rhyming cadence and the overall theme. The illustrations are similar to books written for infants or early childhood aged children. They look to be chalk pastels or watercolor and they give the feeling of a lighthearted book for small children. I also really liked that the names for the baby animals are included, such as calfs or cubs. This would be very helpful for students who are learning about animals and different animal names.  26 book reviews: 27 book reviews: I was read this when I used to have a hard time falling asleep at night so since I had fond memories of it, I decided to reread it again as an adult. This simple book explains how different animals would kiss goof night. For example, the  Would and his pup would kiss and then HOWL! . Although, I liked it when I was younger, I do not think this is the best book for kids since it doesn t teach a lesson, nor does it have very many literary elements incorporated into it. Despite this, it could be a relaxing book for those who are high energy due to its playful art, rhymed verse, and sweet tone. I would not use this in a classroom, but it could be useful to a young child who is just learning vocabulary and words. Moreover, it could help them with memorization.  28 book reviews: If Animals Kissed Good Night by Ann Whitford Paul has not won any awards but it was a finalist for the SCIBA book award. This book is great for pre-K to kindergarten. This book is about if animals kissed goodnight. Its about how they would do it. Also, it shows the relationship between the mother/father and the child animal before bedtime. This book was fun and cute. It brought some creativity into the event of bedtime. It also is heart warming. This book would be great to bring some family time into the classroom. You can discuss what your favorite thing to do before bedtime is. Also. the students can create their own stories.  29 book reviews: If Animals Kiss Goodnight is a children s poetry book geared towards kids ages three through six. It hasn t won any awards but it was a finalist for the SCIBA book award.  This story imagine how different animals would kiss their loved ones good night.  If Animals Kissed Goodnight is an adorable book with bright colors and simple drawings. It rhymes and in my opinion is a great bedtime story. It isn t the type of book to read to a class or to gain information from, but it is fun for young children as there is a hilarious reoccurring theme with the sloths and how long they take to kiss. I also like that they mixed up the genders and family style/dynamics to add some depth to the story.  ",
    " Little Fires Everywhere: A Novel": "book reviews: The order of the small town on the riverbank Forever at war with the order of the dark and starlit soul   Adrienne Rich,  8/1/68   The nonconformist has always been at war with the suburbs Adrienne Rich was writing about it 50 years ago, and she surely was not the first. I can understand this dichotomy; I myself have certainly experienced suburbs where a high level of conformity seemed to be expected, resulting in a weird high-school atmosphere among grown adults. Still, you really don t have to dig very deep to realize that things aren t as black-and-white as they seem. There are all different kinds of people living everywhere, with varying degrees of happiness and fulfillment. All of which is to say, if you re going to write on this theme now, you should probably have something new to add to the conversation, or at least a unique way of expressing it.  takes place in the planned community of Shaker Heights, where an artist named Mia and her teenage daughter Pearl move into a rental home after having lived a peripatetic existence since Pearl s birth. The battle lines are immediately drawn: the nonconformist, creative Mia versus the staid middle-aged matrons of Shaker Heights. Mind you, these battle lines aren t initially drawn by the characters, but by the author, who makes it clear that Mia is the moral center of the book. Characters who like Mia are the good characters; characters who don t like Mia are the bad characters; and characters who are suspicious of Mia at first and then come around to liking her have experienced a redemptive arc. This would be less problematic if Mia hadn t . I was honestly horrified by Mia s actions and I wasn t brought around by the fact that she was an artist, or by the fact that she was allegedly the best mother since the Virgin Mary or whatever. But as far as this book is concerned, Mia is the real deal, an infinitely better person than all those Shaker Heights parents, who, let s face it, are all kind of repressed. Being repressed is the sin of suburbanites, you see. Nothing could possibly be worse, I guess. Oh, there s also a subplot regarding a custody battle between a set of adoptive white Shaker Heights parents and the baby s biological mother, a young Chinese immigrant, which could have been really interesting, but it s given short shrift and is clearly meant only to underscore how amazing Mia is and how horrible the Shaker Heights mothers are in comparison.  Now look, I don t expect any character to be perfect, and I did not expect that from the character of Mia. Obviously, someone in the novel needed to do something scandalous, or you d have no book at all. What I don t like is being told who to root for. I don t like it when authors stack the deck. Just present every character in the fullness of their humanity and let decide who I m rooting for. If you ve done your job properly, I ll root for who you want me to root for anyway. But if you idealize one extremely flawed character at the expense of everyone else, you re going to lose me. You re going to make me side with a bunch of repressed Shaker Heights matrons I have nothing in common with, because those poor matrons never even had a chance at the end of your pen.  Okay, so the nonconformist versus the suburbs theme wasn t handled in a particularly original or illuminating way here. It s possible the book could have been redeemed by good writing, except doesn t really have that either. The constantly shifting viewpoints didn t work for me  and when I say constantly shifting, I don t mean chapter by chapter. I mean paragraph by paragraph, and sometimes sentence by sentence. This results in some extreme awkwardness, as when every sentence in a paragraph is from the point of view of the character of Izzy, except for one sentence in the middle that relays a piece of information that Izzy doesn t know. I guess an omniscient narrator is responsible for that particular sentence? In a few instances the omniscient narrator is even more obtrusive, reminding us who does and doesn t know certain things that have just occurred from one character s viewpoint. But beyond the awkwardness, so many characters are given a moment in the spotlight that I never really felt like I got to know most of them, and what we do know is revealed mainly through soliloquies and flashbacks, some of which are so long and involved that they derail the main story and quash any possible shot at narrative momentum. And let s not forget the eye-rollingly dramatic and implausible plot twists that make it seem as if the author has watched too much . There s the college student who can t afford the year s tuition, and because she s . There s the character who is suspected of And then there s the beloved mentor who is of course There s just so much crammed into this book, but it all adds up to so little.  This is all very awkward, because a representative of the publisher offered me this ARC a few weeks ago and I enthusiastically accepted. I hadn t read Celeste Ng s previous novel, but I was under the impression that she was a good writer and I thought I would really enjoy this one. But I didn t, and I have to be honest about it, because if I m not honest about the books I dislike, I can t expect anyone to trust my word on book I review. seemed endless, it was pedestrian and tedious, and it just regurgitated stereotypes about the suburbs we ve all heard countless times before. I initially thought I would give it 2 stars because, even though I didn t like it, it seemed to me that the author had done what she d set out to do, and I wanted to acknowledge that. But by the time I reached the end of the book, I d changed my mind. It now seems to me that the author truly believes she s written something deeply meaningful, and I know this sounds harsh, but I don t agree. I learned nothing from this book and I didn t enjoy the experience. There s just no other way to say it.  1 book reviews: My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpress.com/    Little Fires Everywhere  is my first read by Celeste Ng, but I m pretty sure that it won t be my last. I could easily have read this book in just one or two sittings but life got in the way (in this case life being a glass of 7up, a knee jerk and  Nooo! Save the books! ). But once the book was dry, I picked it up again and didn t stop until I finished the last page.  Everything in Shaker Heights is planned and there are rules that residents must follow. Houses can only be painted certain colors (to ensure aesthetic harmony), garbage is never put out in front of the house, lawns must always be cut promptly, etc.  The city motto says it all:    When Mia Warren and her fifteen year old daughter, Pearl rent a home from the Richardsons, a prominent Shaker Heights family   their lives will become intertwined in ways they never could have imagined.  Mrs. Richardson liked to rent to people she felt were deserving of her help, people who may have had some tough turns in life. She felt it was her way of giving back. When she first meets Mia Warren and her daughter she thinks they are the perfect tenants.  One of the Richardson boys, Moody is curious about the new tenants and heads over to the rental property. Moody and Pearl hit it off immediately. Moody who has never wanted for anything, is surprised at how this mother and daughter make their way. Mia can stretch a dollar (and leftover food) farther than anyone he s ever seen. It s not long before Moody brings Pearl home to meet everyone. Soon Pearl is spending much of her time at the Richardson home. At first, everything is fantastic. Mrs. Richardson even hires Mia to do some housekeeping and cooking at the Richardson home. But it won t be long before the many differences between Mia and Mrs. Richardson cause a divide that will affect the two families in unimaginable ways.  In some ways, I felt bad for Pearl as the nomadic life that her mother had them living would be hard on anyone, especially a teenage girl. However, Pearl also seemed to benefit from the way they lived. At first, Mia came across as incredibly selfish but it wasn t long before I loved her. Her caring ways were evident and how she responded to the different crises that came up endeared her to me. I may not have agreed with all of her choices but I could certainly see how she would have made them.  Right off the bat I was irked by Mrs. Richardson (the fact that she was rarely referred to by her first name was fitting). Mrs. Richardson was the type who wanted to be seen as someone who cared and helped others. However, you could tell right away that she kept track of all the good things she had done. And you never knew when Mrs. Richardson would want a repayment of her  kindness . When she offers to buy one of Mia s photographs and Mia doesn t fall at her feet with gratitude...    Izzy was a firecracker and I adored her impulsiveness and strong feelings about right and wrong. Even at ten years old, setting shelter cats free , her refusal to conform was thrilling. Mrs. Pissers and the toothpick incident had me giggling. And I hurried to Google to search   by Philip Larkin.  There was a lot going on in  Little Fires Everywhere  but I found it easy to keep up. I will say that it had a bit of a slow start but I feel the author was just setting the stage for all that was to come. And once I hit the halfway mark, I was so completely invested into all of their lives and HAD to know what was going to happen next.  The additional story-line of little Mirabelle McCullough/May Ling Chow s adoption was incredibly thought provoking and had me asking myself some hard questions. I honestly didn t know which side I was on half the time. My head was spinning.    I thought that the development of the characters was fantastic. With so many characters and only so many pages, it takes skill to bring them all to life. And in my opinion; Celeste Ng did a phenomenal job. And with the many 90 s references such as Sir-Mix-a-lot, Smashing Pumpkins, Jerry Springer, and Monica Lewinsky - I was taken back to my own adolescence.  This was an intriguing and compelling domestic drama. A story about motherhood, adolescence, race, rules, right and wrong, and so much more. Great characters and an interesting plot made  Little Fires Everywhere  a fast and fantastic read.  Many thanks go to Penguin Press for providing a copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review.  2 book reviews: All her life, she had learned that passion, like fire, was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control.  4 1/2 stars. You should go into this book expecting what it is: a slow-moving character portrait filled with complex family dynamics and small-town politics. If you know what this is, like with Ng 's Everything I Never Told You, and do not go into it expecting fast-pacing and high-octane drama, you will probably find this quiet read to be extremely .  I have to be in the mood for this kind of read, but when I am, it packs a powerful punch. These characters are , so caught up in the little fires of everyday life in Shaker Heights. There 's several stories going on in here, but the book begins with literal fires lighting up the Richardson household and the knowledge that the youngest daughter, Izzy, the wild card, has disappeared. Presumably because she is guilty of the arson.  Then we move back from there. We start to get a portrait of the events leading up to this dramatic fire. We see the poor artist, Mia, and her daughter, Pearl, move into town and the effect they have on all members of the Richardson family. Further back, we get the past stories of almost every character who comes into this book. It is such a rich work in which .  And, behind it all, is a court case that will affect all the characters lives. A custody battle over a Chinese baby who could be given every toy, every desire, every opportunity by her rich and white adoptive parents - but is that all? Is that enough when her poor birth mother is ready and willing to care for her? Things become very tense. The town becomes divided. And I felt an emotional wreck by the end of it, too.  The Richardson family, along with Mia and Pearl, Bebe, and the McCulloughs, all pulled me into their lives. I despised a character at one point, only to find pity for them a couple of chapters later. The relationship between Izzy and her mother was a real point of interest for me. How Mrs. Richardson 's fears about Izzy affected her behaviour toward her, which in turn affected how Izzy behaved. All leading to the ultimate question: was Izzy always what Mrs. Richardson feared she was? Or did Mrs. Richardson create what she most feared through her treatment of Izzy?  is a great example of how small character dynamics can create a . I love the empathy the author shows for all the people in this book - even the manipulative, morally corrupt and undeserving. No one is merely good or bad. And that is what makes the book so effective. Whose side am I on? I will let you know if I ever figure it out.  | | | |  3 book reviews: *4.25 stars*  Little Fires Everywhere is such an apt title for a novel that delves into the intricacies and angst that undoubtedly burns through some relationships maybe none more so than mother and daughter. At its core, this story explores the notion that being a mother doesn t mean being perfect; it comes down to love, sacrifice and sheer will. Through her cast of captivating characters, Celeste Ng confronts the reality that haunts us all each and every one of us is rife with cracks and flaws, no matter how well we hide it from prying eyes. That s just life.  It s akin to pure magic when you pick up a book from an author you haven t read before and find yourself caught up in what can only be described as book nirvana. I had heard  s writing style was incredible, but I took that with a grain of salt merely an attempt on my part to avoid disappointment. What I didn t anticipate was level of character development. level of intricate detail and the multifaceted beings I wanted nothing more than to surround myself with.  I have to admit, it was Mia that started out as my least favorite of the bunch. Her artsy-fartsy, gypsy-ways came off as incredibly selfish. A mother sacrificing any sense of stability for her daughter, in an attempt to chase her next inspiration, rubbed me the wrong way. How could she not stay in one place and let her incredibly smart daughter thrive?  Then we meet Mrs. Richardson who s been hell-bent on living the life she laid out so perfectly in her mind. From most angles she has it all steady career, lovely home, successful husband, wealth and four children. A conundrum of sorts, she s tenacious, but still somehow oblivious. Initially, I wasn t really sure what to make of her or her motives was I reading more into things than I should?  What binds these two different women together is their teenage children who have their own fires burning between them and a custody battle that rocks their small town. The women end up on opposing sides of the equation, only working to further highlight their differences. The author juxtaposes these two women in many aspects but not overtly so and by the end, I was stunned.  What struck me the most about this journey was the author s ability to change my entire perspective meaning, my thoughts and feelings in the beginning of the story were vastly different by the time I turned that final page. Some aspects ended on a sad note, but overall it was still a satisfying ending to what I can only describe as a fully immersive novel.     4 book reviews: Dang!  If this book does not get your brain churning, well, then you did not read the same book I just did!  This book is filled with so many scenarios with so many questions and no perfect answers. Every situation is a little pile of kindling and any of the questionable solutions will only ignite the fire . . . soon you have a bunch of fires ready to burn everything to the ground. Man, that would be a great title for this book! Oh . . . wait . . .  It has been a long time since I remember reading a book where my mind and problem solving skills have been this challenged. Usually when you are reading you think, \"well, the best route for them to follow is this\" or \"Geez, it 's obvious that they should never have done that.\" In this book I just kept thinking, \"I am glad I am not the one who has to make any of these decisions!\"  Also, this book is full of so many misunderstandings. I get frustrated when someone is falsely accused or the wrong conclusion is assumed. Every 15 minutes I found myself yelling at this book!  \"IT WASN'T HER!\"  \"NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! SOMEONE SPEAK UP!\"  \"OH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO END WELL!\"  I believe I have said it before, but any time a book has you engaged so much you yell at it, want to pull the characters out of the pages and shake them, and/or need a stiff drink to calm your nerves at the end of each chapter, you are reading a pretty darn good book.  Give your analytical side a gift and read this book - it would be a great one for a book club. I imagine it would certainly lead to some lively discussion!  5 book reviews: 4.5 stars. I was hooked while listening to the audiobook and finished it in 2 days. The family dynamics, tension, and nuance is well done. The themes about parenting and motherhood - what is considered \"good\" parenting and who is a \"good\" mother - was such an interesting exploration, along with how white suburbia can be suffocating and push for conformity. But most of all, I loved the portrayal of well-intentioned yet ignorant white and upperclass people, and the gap between a privileged and white POV versus an immigrant in poverty. It s done in such a subtle way that s not in your face and gives readers enough room to explore and think through these issues for ourselves. The only reason why I hesitate to give this 5 stars is I don t think much was done with Mrs. Richardson s kids for readers to care about. I think the ending would have been more impactful if the kids had been better developed and thus have a well-rounded cast of characters.  6 book reviews: my LORD i truly enjoyed this.  there were a few minor things with the pacing that i would have changed just a smidge, and it did not impact me quite as much as ng 's debut, but this was beautiful and wonderful in its own way. i am SO excited for the adaptation. also, i can safely say now that celeste ng is one of my favorite authors and the next thing that she writes cannot come quickly enough.  read!! this! book!!!  7 book reviews: UPDATE: have just watched the first episode of this tv show on Hulu. as someone who really loved the book a lot before the adaptation was even announced: I am a very big fan. Kerry Washington as Mia is a really good choice. also, for personal reasons, Pearl is my favorite character now.   Most of the time, everyone deserves more than one chance. We all do things we regret now and then. You just have to carry them with you.   Never in my life have I read any book, any narrative, that cared lives in the grey area, leaving it impossible not to be invested, impossible not to love every character and cry for every character and root for every character, despite all their flaws.  I really struggle to characterize this book; it s sort of a combination between a mystery and literary fiction, and will probably work best for you if you re a fan of both? is a very slow-burn story about a small town thrown into disarray by a court dispute. When an Asian baby given up by her mother is adopted by a white family, it causes a spiral of events that lead to a scene of a house on fire and a family driven away.  I think I ve already expressed this, but this book is.... a masterpiece. It s one of those books that I finished and then was just on my bed tearing up because it s so well-crafted. The reason this book is so fantastic is primarily structural; we see the end, and then we go back and see the beginning.  But anyway, the reason this book works so well is the characterization. There is much to appreciate here. I like that Moody is sort of written as the stereotypical jilted nice guy, and and then we see more nuance to that characterization. I loved the complexity of the dynamic between poor characters and rich characters; I loved how no character is black and white, but they have definition nonetheless.  Of the approximately-eleven-person main cast, Izzy is my absolute favorite. Izzy is a ridiculously relatable character for me personally mainly through her relationship with her mom. There s a line somewhere where Izzy says she thinks her mother sees her as such a demon that all her actions are framed in that light - that was me. And that is still me in my relationship with one of my parents.  And on another very personal note, Mia  kind of reminds me of another. Some of you who follow me on this platform might now that my mom and I are really, really close, and I grew up with her as my main support system. And I think  her relationship with Izzy just felt so personal to me for that reason.  So maybe this was too personal a read for me, but I m going to be honest: it s my belief that reading is something that is meant to be personal. And maybe the degree to which this personally affected me is the most important part of all.  There s a scene within this book that has stuck with me since the beginning, in which the adoptive mother of the baby is asked how she plans to incorporate Chinese culture into the life of the baby, and she brings up  oriental rugs  and how she gives the baby rice. And it s this awful moment, because we she loves that baby. We do. But in that moment she becomes the persecutor of her own child. She does not understand, and so she perpetrates a culture that has been trying to swallow up her child. I think that s what this book is about, in the end:  This book was masterful. And I hope you all read it.  | | |  8 book reviews: There are some books when you finish, you just sit motionless with blank face, feeling speechless, resuming your awkward position for hours and then you turn back into your life after getting frozen by a magical dramatic literary wand s power. That s what happened to me. And I realized I haven t written any word about this stunning, amazing book and now Witherspoon and Washington s Hulu series is streaming right now and it seems like scriptwriter Liz Tigelaar caught the essence of the plot and reflected into 8 great episodes (especially episode 7 was remarkably the best and heartfelt one) And Witherspoon s Elena is her best book character composition. I highly recommend it! (Better than Big Little Lies)   So here we go: this book is character driven, slow burn drama which will help a lot turn into series to give us so much details and realistic portraits about characters, always works well for me. Small town dynamics, dysfunctional family issues, class differences, morality about a child s own destiny, hypocrisy, lies, secrets mixing each other and slow-building tension rises at the end with powerful, thought- provoking, twisty ending leaves you speechless.  Welcome to Shaker Heights! Richardson household is burning into fire and their daughter Izzy is nowhere to be seen. She might be responsible of this chaos. Then we slowly going back and forth between the snippets of Richardson family s relationship with poor artist Mia and her daughter Pearl who became their tenants and afterwards.  And behind their story, there is custody war over a Chinese baby s adoption by Richardson family s close friends. Should baby be adopted by people who are so rich and ready to present her every opportunity she s dreamed of or should her biological mother take the custody even though they may suffer from poorness and financial struggles?  Unhealthy, ballistic relationship with Izzy and her mother and striking differences between Mia and Elena and too many lies and secrets  revelations change everything in their lives. When the fire starts to destroy everything they had in their lives, they need to start from scratch and learn from their mistakes.  It s powerful, emotional, questioning, unique story. I know it s so challenging to pick a side because nobody is blameless and innocent. I hope we see a good adaption without losing the essence of the story and its well-crafted characterization.      9 book reviews: So, self-identification determines if a book is YA? Based on more than 60% of the content, this is young adult material. It s good; parts are excellent, others not so much.  I liked Mia s backstory as she became an artist using experimental photography. I thought that the custody dispute concerning  Oriental Barbie  was worth at least a star or two.  A lot of the characters are clich d. The at-home Mr. Richardson could be a cardboard cutout with excellent earning skills. He fairs a lot better before the judge. The Richardson children fit into  The Breakfast Club  well. A jock, a popular girl, a smart kid and Izzy who may well be a transgendered Holden Caulfield (thank you to my GR friend, Bill Kupersmith), but I liked her a lot more than that wretched boy.  So yeah, the Richardson s have a child for each grade in high-school. Mrs. Richardson produced four singletons in roughly as many years. While in other respects, she is a perfect match for her orderly and rule-bound community. The rapid-fire baby production seemed reckless and out of place. It is the only part of her character that jibbed with aggressively investigating her tenant and employee s past. Opening a  can of worms  and a house full of screaming babies being equally disordered and unpredictable.  I don t believe that she is meant to be likable. She approaches friendship with same calculation as Claire Underwood with a careful tally of every kindness. But, as she is central to the book, I wish she were plausible. Even if she were perfectly constructed, the story is still awfully scattered.  My son heard part of the book while we were driving over the holidays. When we stopped, he would say  So  and give a one-sentence summary of the upcoming section or chapter. I don t believe he has any preternatural gifts as plot savant. A lot of the story is pretty predictable.  I have a quibble about that car. Is that the same VW rabbit Mia s brother bought when they were teenagers? If so, how did she manage vehicle maintenance on minimum wage earnings supplemented by occasionally selling a piece of art? Twenty to thirty years of use is aging NASA spacecraft territory, but this car starts reliably, runs well over long distances, and doesn t need any repairs. It seems oddly out of place given the careful mathematics of Bebe s poverty.  P.S. I stand corrected my son says he is too a plot savant.  10 book reviews: Update.... because I don t know where else to ask this question: how many saw the Hulu series? Thoughts? I loved it. I liked it better than my experience of reading the book. The lead and supporting actors were so well chosen. Kerry Washington was outstanding...... I think she deserves to win an award for her acting role. Reece was great also. And so are her kids.  Did anyone else enjoy the series more than the book? Less? Coronavirus chatter time?  . Love yo hear others thoughts.   Old review: I pre-ordered this book months ago. It arrived at 12:01am today. I ve been reading non - stop.... a one- sitting read with a few necessity breaks.  Here 's is my problem.... I feel as if I have read this story before. I was only mildly interested in many scenes. There were parts I found trite and parts I found semi boring. Personally - I found the characters to be very one dimensional.  Here 's another problem I have: Yesterday I finished reading \"In The Fall They Come Back\", by Robert Bausch. I saw a lot of similarities in these two books, but this novel did not 'wow' me nearly as much.  This story  'seemed' like it had all the elements I usually love ..... The wealthy and thrifty battle it out...plus moral issues to think about ...but my heart was not always in it. Not sure why. It could be me.  For one thing..... I spent summers in Shaker Heights .... I felt this book could have been written anywhere. Plus.... I am not sure I appreciated some of the stereotyping of this community.  BUT ....here 's a small flavor of the characters you will spend time with:  'The Richardson 's family': Bill is an attorney and drives a BMW Sedan Elena is a wife & mom..... works for the local newspaper: 'Sun Press'. She drives a Lexus  THE FOUR SIBLINGS: Lexie -senior drives an explorer- has the lead in her School play. Seems fruity & shallow at times - but is an excellent student Trip - a junior - drives a jeep - loves sports - handsome -fit --and charming Moody - sophomore- rides a bike ( bless him) - most compassionate- very bright -introspective Izzy - Freshman- considered black sheep of the bunch - feels different than others in her family.  'The Warren 's: They recently moved into a rental ( a duplex) that the Richardsons own. Mia- 36 years old, single mom, artist. Mia drives a VW Rabbit. She would rather mop floors any day- quietly alone- than have to wait on customers. Pearl -15 years old - Mia 's daughter - shy - honors student -  Paul, my husband, is rushing me - he says RETIRE.... lol..... So.....I LIKED IT.....but..... after several great books I have recently read, I ca not say I am 'wild' about it. It was ok!!! - alright - better than OK! Worth reading! Others may love it! 3.6 stars  11 book reviews: 4.5 12 book reviews: I am removing my original review due to a new intention to not be overly negative on Goodreads - too much badness in the world already! - but I didn t much care for this one!   13 book reviews: Here 's the thing: I could tell you this book is really good.  I could tell you that the characters feel incredibly real and lovable.  I could tell you that this story sweeps you up and feels unputdownable more than any thriller I have read in ages.  I could tell you that the writing style is immersive.  In short, I could tell you to just get on with the inevitable already and read this.  But like...Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington and the New York Times bestseller list already told you all of that.  So listen to them instead.  Bottom line: Worth the hype!!  ------------   celeste ng is the master.  review to come / 4.25 stars  ------------   i am obsessed with reading books after they have been adapted into a tv show or movie when i have absolutely no intention of watching the adaptation.  it 's a real conversation starter.  ------------  taking idea and reading only books by asian authors this month!                 14 book reviews: I would rate this 3.5 stars. (I know, it 's killing me, too.)  Sometimes one of my greatest frustrations with books I read is that it is difficult for me to believe that a character would do something egregious as a knee-jerk reaction to something they do not agree with. I know, I am reading fiction, which is not always directly based on real life, but sometimes a character 's actions are so ridiculous and ring so false that they really change my feelings about a book.  Other times a character is so unlikable (although you may discover it 's all an act) that they are just so off-putting, and they detract from the book 's appeal.  Both things happened for me while reading Celeste Ng 's new book, , and I am so disappointed, because I wanted to love it. While I found much of the book simply beautiful, the plot and one character travel down a path that I found a little too far-fetched and irritating that it spoiled how I felt.  To someone on the outside looking in, the Richardson family seems like the quintessential Shaker Heights, Ohio family two successful and driven parents, four good-looking children, sure to follow in their parents' footsteps. The perception is not all false Elena Richardson, who returned to her hometown after college to raise a family, is a reporter for the local paper; her husband is a successful attorney. Their children, each one year apart, are each popular and successful in their own way, except the youngest, Izzy, who has a knack for standing out, especially if it means pushing her mother 's buttons.  When Mia Warren, an enigmatic, slightly bohemian artist, and her daughter Pearl arrive in Shaker Heights, and move into the Richardsons' rental apartment, the family quickly falls under their spell. Pearl, who has moved more times than she can count, always on her mother 's whim, has finally extracted a promise from Mia that they will stay in Shaker Heights, and she is excited to finally be able to make friends and cement relationships instead of biding her time until she leaves town again.  Pearl and the Richardsons' younger son, Moody, become close friends, although quickly she becomes a part of the family. Mia, too, in addition to working on her art, begins working for the Richardsons, becoming an unexpected confidante for older daughter Lexie, and forging a relationship with Izzy that she ca not have with her mother. But Mia is also wary of the Richardsons and does not quite trust that all is as perfect as it seems.  When a custody battle involving one of Elena 's oldest friends becomes fodder for the media, everyone in town has an opinion. Elena discovers that she and Mia are on opposite sides of this fight, which causes Elena to view Mia with suspicion. Suddenly she feels the need to find more about this mysterious woman who holds her family in her thrall, and Elena does not realize or care, really about what damage the truth may cause, for everyone.  \"All her life, she had learned that passion, like fire, was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control. It scaled walls and jumped over trenches. Sparks leapt like fleas and spread as rapidly; a breeze could carry embers for miles. Better to control that spark and pass it carefully from one generation to the next, like an Olympic torch. Or, perhaps, to tend it carefully like an eternal flame: a reminder of light and goodness that would never could never set anything ablaze. Carefully controlled. Domesticated. Happy in captivity. The key, she thought, was to avoid conflagration.\"  is a powerful meditation on motherhood and the sometimes-tenuous bond between mother and child. It 's also a book about the destructive power of secrets, misunderstandings, and miscommunication, and how easily problems could be avoided if people would just say what they thought, or speak up rather than let a person roll over them. At its most poignant, this is a book about the damage that can be done by neglect or mistreatment, even when it 's unintended, and how finding someone who seems to care about you can be a life-changing force.  Ng is a storyteller with such quiet power. As she did in her spectacular first novel, , she captures the routine and dramatic moments in a family 's life, uncovering just how much goes on underneath the silences. While I appreciate her fearlessness in creating unappealing characters, I really was unhappy with some of her choices, which I wo not reveal for fear of spoiling the plot, but they just seemed so ludicrous (and in one case, just a wee bit convenient and predictable) that one character and her treatment of others became almost one-dimensional.  I have seen many glowingly positive reviews of this book, so I would not let my criticisms dissuade you from reading it if it interests you. Ng is an immense talent, and I look forward to seeing what 's next for her. If you do read this, I would love to talk to you after you are finished, to see what you thought about the things that frustrated me.  See all of my reviews at .  15 book reviews: I think it 's safe to say that I will read everything Celeste Ng ever writes. Just like in a mystery book, you have to work at getting to the root of her stories. She does not hand you the plot from the get-go, but instead offers you kernels of the story until everything comes together at the very end. Although this can lead to frustration or boredom, especially with the sometimes barebones plot, I loved it. I am very much a character-focused reader, and this was very much a character-focused novel. There 's not much action driving this book forward. It 's slow paced, but this gives us the time to dive deeper into the nuances of the complicated situation these characters are placed into. By examining from all sides, we are shown how both humans and their choices are complicated. If you like character studies, complex relationships, and a '90s suburban setting, please pick this up!  16 book reviews: I really did not want to read this book. Unfortunately for me, it was a book club pick, so I read it in one sitting on a plane. I was grumpy for the first hundred pages, which I thought might have been unwarranted. Most of my initial ire went to this: what was the purpose of setting this so firmly in 1998?? Why does the book double down so much on referencing TLC, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Lexie 's Explorer, and Charlie 's Angels? (The date was confirmed for sure 254 pages into the book, when the date of May Ling 's appearance at the fire station is stated as January 1997, but by then I was so oversaturated with Pearl using the dial-up internet in the library that I did not care.) Maybe I am just being uncharitable, I thought, because I loved , a movie that is firmly set in 2002. Upon reflection, however, I have determined that the core difference between these two artistic attempts is that is actually good. This is not.  This book sets up some interesting questions and themes around family, motherhood, and social conformity. The problem is that the author has a very clear answer to all of these questions, conveyed through very clumsy third-person narration. The third-person perspective switches between characters rapidly, just in time for them to have insights that seem out-of-place or too pat. Seventeen-year-old Trip Richardson, interested in girls and partying, thinks pensively that Pearl Warren \"linger[s] comfortably in the grey spaces\" between right and wrong. More egregiously, the family patriarch, Mr. Richardson, gets exactly one paragraph from his perspective, and it 's this one:  It 's one thing to set up this tension, between conformity and independence, and quite another to use a minor character as an authorial mouthpiece to hammer your point home so obviously. Do you not trust your story or your readers to do this work for you?  The other big problem with the writing is that the author clearly favors Mia Warren, who is set up as a foil to Elena Richardson. Elena is a conforming suburban mother who downgraded her career to focus on her children, while Mia is a free-wheeling artist who not only knows how to live life outside the lines, but is (we are supposed to believe) a better mother than all of those repressed Shaker Heights mothers combined. I could not stand Mia Warren. If the author had not been so enamored with Mia, it 's possible that I would like her more; as it is, Mia , which is TOTALLY CRAZY. I do not think the book understands how truly bananas this is and how far divorced from reality these plot points are: . I almost sympathize with Elena Richardson, because I wanted to throttle Mia (and I did not actually have to spend any time with her), but then I remember the incredibly ridiculous and poorly written scene in which Elena .  The one plot I found interesting was the story of May Ling/Mirabelle and her adoption, but this does not get very much page time. And again, this gets put through Mia 's lens. I think the book could have worked better if at least one of the plot lines were removed to focus on this as a central conflict.  Anyway, I am a little surprised at how well this book is reviewed. I think you either have to really like slavish detail about Shaker Heights in 1998, or you have to enjoy reading a book where the author constantly moralizes at you. I fall into neither of those categories.  17 book reviews: February 's Reading Vlog is out today! The Written Review Shaker Heights is the quintessential quiet town. Until Mia (and her daughter, Pearl) come to town.  The Richardsons have lived in Shaker Heights from the literal moment it was created and they rent out one of their houses to low-income families (such as Mia).  Mia is an artist and throughout Pearl 's life, they have traveled from town-to-town as Mia creates art and then sells it.    For the first time, Mia promises Pearl that they will settle down.  And at first everything is just as Pearl pictured it. She quickly befriends the Richardson kids, school is challenging but satisfying and she even has a crush on a boy.  But then thing take a turn for the worse.  Overall thoughts on this one - it was good.  The way Celeste Ng crafts this gorgeous book hooked me from the start.  The characters were - they all felt like real people (even the secondary/tertiary ones!).  I loved how my thoughts/opinions on them were constantly shifting. A character that I hated at the beginning turned into one of my favorites, and one that I adored became someone I abhorred.  The plot itself was a juggling masterpiece - so many different subplots constantly held up in the air and I never knew which one I wanted to follow next.  Honestly, I do not want to say anything more -  | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  18 book reviews: When I read Celeste Ng 's debut novel Everything I Never Told You in late 2014, I was smitten. Ng 's writing was so beautiful, her characters so real, and the story so compelling. I instantly knew I would be reading whatever she put out next.  Three years later and I am happy to say that Ng has returned with just as stunning of a novel as her debut. Little Fires Everywhere is hands down one of the best books I have read this year; and just like its predecessor will be rising to the top of my yearly favorites list.  I do not want to say too much about this novel because with Ng 's books, I have discovered, it 's best to go in anticipating very little and being surprised along the way. Because she is good at surprises and not the kind of plot twists you will read in a thriller or spy novel; the kind of surprises that sneak up on you in real life and seem to tear your world apart. Her novels are domestic, but they are not quaint. They have a raw, emotional power to them that are especially drawn out by her incredibly crafted characters. The inner turmoil is just as important as the external conflict in her stories, and that makes for a compulsively readable, yet immensely relatable read. You can empathize with so many parties in her stories, and this one is no exception.  To me, these characters jumped from the pages; they have the mannerism (she 's observant, akin to Adichie in that sense) and the motivations of people you know in your own life. Mrs. Richardson 's ethics and worldview are as real and as contrary as Mia 's artistic sentiments. And you ca not help feeling for both of them at times. That 's what makes this story so good there is no black and white, despite the obviously drawn lines between the differing characters. Ng exists in the grey, and her mission, it seems to me, is to pull you in to the grey too and think about how murky and complicated and messy life is.  I will stop gushing, but only as long as people go pick this up and read it (along with her first novel too)! Ng is surely one of my favorite living writers, and, again, I ca not wait to see what she does next.  19 book reviews: Some people need to cut ties to have a fresh start, others only need to say goodbye, and some people, some people just need to burn everything down.  A fire starts in the idyllic land of Shaker Heights. Residence of the Richardson family, the reliable parents Bill and Elena, and their lovely kids, Trip, Lexie, Moody and Izzy. The perfect Richardson family, watching their perfect dreamed house ablaze, with imperfect little fires, lighting every single room. Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl, the tenants of their rental house, mysteriously gone the day before. Who started the fire, but more importantly, why?  When you find yourself wanting to finish a book, and at the same time, not wanting it to end, then you realize you stumbled upon something good. A remarkable read indeed. An almost-favorite status earned. This novel touches some important topics like motherhood. privilege and accountability in a very meaningful way. Excellent character development. The entitlement of the Richardson family can be kind of tiresome, but it works wonders with the carefree spirit of the Warrens. I specially loved pretty much everything about Mia s past (and present) and all the bits about photography. Almost made me want to start photography myself.  Still remaining, the mini-series (2020).  ----------------------------------------------- : Most of my  currently-reading  are already  read , just been too lazy to review.

I now have to pick up \"Everything I Never Told You\" which has been on my shelves for way too long!  Would recommend if you are looking for a slow character driven book full of emotions! 22 book reviews: Metaphorically speaking, everyone has 'little fires' in their lives - events that begin as a small spark, and have the ability to transform into a raging inferno, changing lives for ever.  Shaker Heights, Cleveland is an idyllic place to live, everything has been planned to create the perfect community, but it 's residents are expected to live by its many rules and regulations.  The Richardson 's are quintessentially the kind of family who the community of Shaker Heights was built for. Elena Richardson was brought up with these rules, and she and her husband are determined that their four children, Lexie, Trip, Moody and Izzy will live by them too. Izzy is not exactly a chip off the old block though, and will prove to be very disruptive.  The Richardson 's rent out an apartment to people they feel need a helping hand, and their latest tenants are Mia and her daughter Pearl. Mia is a free spirit, an artist specialising in photography, and when Elena s troublesome daughter Izzy becomes close to Mia, Elena finds that she 's jealous of the relationship, a relationship that does not exist between her and Izzy. Further to this, an adoption case in the community puts Elena and Mia on opposing sides, and Elena decides to do some digging on Mia s past, and uproots some secrets that will change everything.  Oh gosh, this book explores so many issues, but for me the one that stood out was motherhood, and in particular, the relationship between mothers and daughters, from baby 's early days to teenage angst.  It was beautifully written, with characters so well developed I felt as if I knew them personally. I also liked the setting of Shaker Heights, a place so perfect and orderly, and yet, ultimately there is always someone who will rip up those precious rules and regulations and throw them in the garbage.  Celeste Ng writes with great insight and empathy, and leaves the reader with much to think about.  *Thank you to Netgalley and Little, Brown Book Group for my ARC in exchange for an honest review*  23 book reviews: 5 Amazing Bright Shiny Stars! I would give it 100 if Goodreads would let me.  Little Fires Everywhere is a novel that far surpasses any other that I have ever read. I do not know how Celeste Ng did it. It is a brilliantly written novel with intricate, rich and wholly vivid characters whose lives are so fully intertwined you ca not help but read on in bewildered awe of how Celeste Ng created these characters. My nerve endings were fully engaged on high alert from the first sentence.  Shaker Heights, Ohio is an affluent town with rules and regulations like no other. Mrs. Richardson lives by them, having been raised by them and she has raised her four children (Lexie, Trip, Moody and Izzy) to abide by them as well. She rents a little apartment in Shaker Heights to Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl, who are less fortunate. Mia is a free spirited artist, who lives life to the fullest. These women have one thing in common and one thing only: they love their children immensely and they accept each other 's as their own. Mia (or rather Ms. Ng) describes it beautifully:    Neither live perfect lives, sometimes in fact they make grave mistakes, yet their love for their children never falters.  These mothers relationships with each other, their family and everyone in town is threatened when a custody battle ensues between a friend of the Richardsons, Mrs. and Mr. McCullough, who are in the middle of adopting a Chinese American baby and a friend of Mia 's, Bebe, who is the birth mother. This battle wrecks havoc on the town and causes incredible strife between the families.  The character of Izzy, Mrs. Richardson 's daughter had me from the beginning (kind of like Hannah from Ms. Ng 's Everything I Never Told You - which I also loved). Izzy has a strength and over came odds that most children in her position would not. Her triumphs made my heart soar.  Somehow Ms. Ng made me change my mind about some of the characters throughout the course of this novel.    Little Fires Everywhere was a Traveling Sister Group Read and included Brenda, Norma, Jennifer, Holly, Melissa & Kendall. We all had a fabulous time reading this one together - the group discussions for this incredible read were amazing and I look forward to our next read together.  For the full Traveling Sisters Group Review, please see Norma and Brenda 's Blog:   Thank you to Edelweiss, Penguin Press and Celeste Ng for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.  Published on Goodreads, Edelweiss and Amazon on 9.17.17.  24 book reviews: I would not even know where to begin to try and review this one. Holy fuck. 25 book reviews: The Richardson family lives a perfect life, planned to a T and that 's what Elena Richardson, her husband and four children seem to have, at least to fifteen year old Pearl Warren. Pearl moves with her itinerant artist mother, Mia, into a rental house owned by the Richardsons in Shaker Heights and becomes infatuated with this family, their house, their life style so different from her own and is mostly infatuated with three of the teenage siblings. The reader though knows from the get go that there 's no perfection here . An awful thing happens to this family and we know what it is from the first sentence but I wo not give it away.  The Shaker Heights motto is: \"Most communities just happen; the best are planned \" : the underlying philosophy being that everything could - and should- be planned out, and that by doing so you could avoid the unseemly, the unpleasant, and the disastrous.\" The truth is that life happens and no matter what - things cannot be avoided and what happens here defies this underlying philosophy.  But this is not the most awful thing that happens in this family. For me it was the dysfunctional relationship that Elena has with her youngest daughter Izzy . Izzy reminds me in some ways of Hannah in Ng 's last book, Everything I Never Told You. Unlike Hannah, Izzy is not invisible not totally ignored, but she is picked on, made fun of and seems to always be the recipient of her mother 's impatience with things that are not perfect. Theirs is not the only mother-daughter relationship that Ng focuses on . There is Mia and Pearl, who move from place to place, with Pearl not knowing the reason why or who her father was. There is Bebe, Mia 's coworker, and her newborn baby May-Ling that she abandons and then fights to get custody. Bebe 's story at first seems secondary but it ends up being the impetus for Elena 's almost obsessive search to find out Mia 's past.  Ng delves deep into her characters and you feel you know them inside and out even though it takes until the end to fully understand Elena and Izzy. You may not like all of them but you will understand them . This I find to be Ng 's strength as a writer- how she makes us know her characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the novel, is when the Richardsons find the photographs that Mia leaves for them. She came to know them too . Definitely recommended to those who were fans of Everything I Never Told You, and stories of families who are less than perfect, which I am sure many of us can relate to.  I received an advanced copy of this book from Penguin Publishing Group through Edelweiss. The book links are not working for me now but I will try again later to insert them.  26 book reviews: God, this was good. I m speechless at this point of finishing the book. This story was pure magic. And to think I was about to unhaul it as well. The abomination. Can you imagine what I was about to miss out on?! Don t worry, I kicked myself already!  Celeste Ng s words are beyond captivating. She has, for me, created one of the best character driven stories ever. I m not going to bother telling you what the plot is about. Go find out for yourself! You re welcome! I m serious, you are welcome!  As soon as I started reading, the writing drew me in. She is a master at letting the writing speak for itself. The mystery? It came from her writing. The intriguing plot? The writing. The conflict I was experiencing? The writing. The characters that I felt I knew to my core and actually existed for me? The flippin  writing did it all.  I kept on rereading a sentence because I felt that I could extract more meaning, more magic from it. I was relishing in it, holding it close for a while before I moved on to the next sentence and let it go. But then I stumbled across one of those magical sentences again and the cycle started all over again.  As for the characters, well, they were a treat. In the sense that if you enjoy reading characters that ve been well-developed, that are layered, nuanced, flawed and realistic, this book is it for you. It was, essentially, a character study. You get to know them intimately and I enjoyed that aspect the most. These characters are not black and white. Each of them had their reasoning as to why they did what they did, the choices they made and the viewpoints they had. I loved this point was honed in time and time again; that circumstances shape who you are, who you become. That there are many different paths to living your life and that most of the time, things fall under the grey area.  There were so many questions that were thrown at the reader and I liked that one had to think for oneself. The answers weren t handed to you, because does life have all of the answers? You make choices and deal with the consequences, whether good or bad. It created for an interesting discussion and battle within my own head.  One of my favourite books for sure.   -  Buddy-reading with  This book has been receiving non-stop praise. You people better have not been lying about it.  27 book reviews: Intensely complex, multi layered, and intricately plotted Little Fires Everywhere is a profoundly complicated and jarring read about motherhood, freedom, and the human experience.  When unconventional artist Mia and her fifteen year old daughter, Pearl, move to Shaker Heights, Ohio their lives dramatically change. Of even great significance is their impact on the seemingly perfect Richardson family. On the surface, the Richardson s seem to have it all--perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect children (minus one), but something is missing. Living in the bubble of the cookie cutter community of Shaker Heights, their world is insular and small. Mia and Pearl s presence shakes them to the core and opens them up to a world of new possibilities.  Told through the eyes of multiple characters, this is a slow burn read with fluid changes of POV. While one of the main events occurs in the first chapter, it is not until the end that one can fully understand the implications of \"the little fires everywhere.\"  Here s the thing--when I first started reading this, I had a hard time connecting to the characters and the plot. Several times I wanted to give up and start another book, but Ng s beautiful writing kept pulling me back in. It wasn t until about half way through, I felt the subtle spark of connection, and as it grew my feelings about this book grew. When I got to the end, I was simply stunned by how this book snuck up on me and overpowered my emotions. To sum up my reading experience:  And it was complicated, what had happened. It was a terribly awkward agonizingly slow, painfully intimate story that unfolded.   28 book reviews: I would probably give this 3.5, I guess. I do not know. I did not like this book, but I feel like I should. Ng is a phenomenal writer but I just could not get into this book. The first chapter was amazing and I thought I was in for something special.  There was a clear theme of ignorance in the \"progressive\" town of Shaker Heights that only outsiders and Izzy could see. The reason I could not get into this book was that all the supporting characters felt a little thin. Like they were not actually people, they were just there to show how ignorant and selfish the people of Shaker Heights were.  Mia was obviously a fantastic character and had multiple chapters dedicated to her backstory and why she became the artist she was/why she had the feelings about the central conflict that she had. By the end of the story it felt like there really was not a choice. Mia 's side was clearly in the right and the Richardsons and the McCulloughs were too ignorant to ever really support. I do not know. I know there are people like them in the world. I know why this book is so popular and it deserves the success it 's had.  I just could not get into it.  29 book reviews: At first glance, this book seems to be mostly about teenagers, but then it struck me that it s really about parenting. Each parent thinks they re doing the right things in the way they raise their children. But who truly is?  Ng does a good job of bringing each character to life. Izzy is the most unique of the characters. And the relationship between Izzy and Mrs. Richardson is spot on perfect.  When it came to Izzy, Mrs. Richardson was seldom calm, and for that matter, Izzy herself never was.   There are multiple storylines here, all equally fascinating. The one that grabbed me the most was between Bebe Chow and the McCulloughs. I flip flopped back and forth between whose side I was on. The heartache of both sides was palpable.  It took a while for the book to truly grab me. But once it did, it really did. The title is so apt. Not just the physical fire, but the fires that burn within the characters, especially the fire that ignited in Mrs. Richardson.  It s interesting that the author refers to Mrs. Richardson by her formal name, whereas everyone else is called by their first name. It suits her perfectly, as she is such a stickler for tradition and following the rules.  This is a fascinating book with a lot going for it. Five rich stars!  Update - both of my book clubs had this as their selection this month. In both cases, the discussions were great. Any clubs looking for ideas, I highly recommend.  ",
    " Live Free Or Die: America (and the World) on the Brink": "book reviews: Although he prattles on a bit, the essence of what he says is spot on. We get the choice at the ballot box, to Live Free or be destroyed. Just look at Portland, Seattle and Chicago. 1 book reviews: The book is very biased and misleading. Once you start reading, the author wastes no time bending the truth. See this, for example:  among the reasons they elected Donald Trump to deflate the Deep State and turn back the tide of this leftist juggernaut.   First of all, Donald Trump did not get the most votes in the last election. Secondly, I just think it s weird that a cursory search through the author s books and Fox News show transcripts will reveal that the author literally never used the term  the Deep State  before March 2017, yet he now opens his books saying voters  elected Donald Trump to deflate the Deep State.  Was that what they were doing?! Before it became Hannity s favorite buzzword, the  Deep State  was popularized by Mike Lofgren, who wrote a pretty good book about it titled  The Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government ; it was not a conspiracy theory, but ever since pro-Trump propagandists suddenly fell in love with the term (because of its potential to excite the imaginations of right-wing voters, who were already big fans of Alex Jones and previously Glenn Beck), it s been transformed into one, and Mike Lofgren has expressed his dismay over the fact that people like Sean Hannity have warped it beyond recognition. I can picture how Lofgren might be particularly incensed by Hannity doing it because Lofgren writes so much about how national security has been used an excuse for the government to break all the rules, and Hannity was notorious for being so cavalier about defending the Bush administration on the issue of torture that he once agreed to be waterboarded for charity. (Over a decade has passed and he still has not followed through.) So anyway, right-wingers co-opting Lofgren s concept is why you ve suddenly got right-wing pundits saying things like, Err yeah, the Deep State, that thing I ve never mentioned before 2017, that s what the top issue for voters was! It s a bit surreal to see someone who appears on the television news every weeknight peddling this InfoWars-level nonsense and rewriting history in this book!  On the other hand, maybe he just doesn t know history. He certainly can t seem to remember the last several months correctly; for example, says:  . . . it s possible Joe Biden will suddenly moderate his message after winning the party primaries. However, he did the opposite to win the Democrat nomination over Bernie Sanders. It ll be nearly impossible for Biden to walk back his newfound radicalism.   What?! I m pretty sure that didn t happen. The author makes it sound like Biden had to become Bernie to win. That would be very cool if it were true because Bernie was the best candidate, but I can t help but wonder if maybe he wrote one version of this paragraph just in case Bernie ended up winning and another in case Biden ended up winning so that the correct version could be chosen for the final version of the manuscript, and then he didn t bother to fix the details because people are used to getting fake news from Hannity anyway, so it s no big deal if it isn t totally accurate. I m personally not a big fan of fake news though so I think that s one of the major flaws of this book, because it s so full of it.  There s so much conspiratorial nonsense in this book. The author argues that Barack Obama must have been a secret radical because the nation has become more liberal since he was first elected president. This is ridiculous logic that gets the causal relationship totally reversed; the fact is, the electorate is getting more left-wing. Basically only old people are big fans of the Republican Party; there is nothing about what Republicans believe that appeals to young voters (some Republicans remain unfazed by this because they believe in the myth that voters will get more conservative with age, but political science totally proves that wrong), and even if there were, consider the fact that, if you are a young voter, every major national crisis that has occurred so far has occurred under a Republican president: the September 11th terrorist attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, the coronavirus pandemic (and the currently mostly Republican government s totally failed response), the concomitant economic collapse, etc. Add that to the fact that youth support for Democrats was already trending upwards even before Barack Obama was elected. Clearly this idea that electing Republicans will do anything to stop the trend is just ridiculous.  Also, not content to just make fake news, the author also makes fake history. For example, he writes that the United States  paid the price for world freedom by defeating fascism, Nazism, communism, and Imperial Japan,  which is a cartoonish version of history that is just amazingly false. First of all, Russia made far more sacrifices and really deserves more credit for the victory on the Western front, where the U.S. barely even helped until the final years of the war because going to war against Hitler was politically unpopular among right-wingers such as Charles Lindbergh and other members of the notoriously anti-Semitic America First Committee. ( America First where have I heard that before?!) We also did not defeat communism in any sense of the word; we lost in Vietnam, we lost in Cuba (e.g., Bay of Pigs invasion, Operation Mongoose, etc.), we only won the space race because we decided winning the space race meant being the first to get to the moon (Russia was actually the first to do everything else, and we didn t even care about going into space until we saw Russia doing it (even though we re constantly told communism and socialism stifle innovation and technological progress, blah blah blah now we don t even care about going into space anymore because we couldn t figure out how to use it to make money or blow other countries up), etc. We also did not fight Japan for freedom; the United States was openly favorable to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War and the annexation of Korea. Also, why is Imperial Japan the only Imperial Whatever that was bad? If we really cared about freedom, we would ve invaded England, because they had the biggest empire and they definitely were not nice to India, China, or really anyone else in the world. So that proves the author is totally wrong about everything.  Another weird thing about this book is that the author seems to sort of obsessively focus on the youngest woman in the 435-person legislative body known as the House of Representatives (for all the readers who don t know about that). I know AOC is very cool and hopefully going to be President some day, but her vote is just one of 435 so it s just weird how the author mentions her name over 30 times in some form (usually as  AOC  but occasionally as  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ), yet he does not name most other members of the House of Representatives even once! I guess maybe it would be logical if the author were a fan of her, but actually he s just one of her haters, and he really needs to scrape the bottom of the barrel for reasons to keep hating, like her  flippant  tweet about something said by Joe Lieberman one of the worst living non-Republican ex-senators, known for helping Republicans to sabotage the Affordable Care Act so that the U.S. healthcare system could continue to be number one at being the worst. Also, the author complains about Rashida Tlaib because she used a bad word once, which is just unconscionable, and I guess that s why, out of all the pundits on TV, he s probably the biggest brownnoser of noted profanity non-user Donald Trump.  The only reason to read this book is if you want to vote for Donald Trump but the moral part of your brain that does not want millions to die from coronavirus and the coming economic depression is making you have second thoughts about voting for him. I do not think the book is really persuasive at all though because anyone could totally debunk every argument in the book!  2 book reviews: As a Canadian , I try to keep abreast as to what people are thinking and were they get their ideas. As a spectator to the American experiment , this book is a historical document to showcase the utter lack of critical thought and quite frankly a strange demand for clear cut propaganda. This book is for those that want to be reassured by the fox News fear machine in print. If someone is this dense not see past the spin and enjoy this book , you know who you are and I suppose you will enjoy it. So terrible book from a position of critical thinking but great if you are a dim witted fear monger. I should also add that your left wing is also out to lunch. The world is watching you guys fall apart.  3 book reviews: Outstanding book; a history lesson about the greatest country on earth. Fodder & inspiration for continuing to share the gospel of American exceptionalism. I highly recommend, especially to independents and Democrats who love our country. 4 book reviews: The author lays out an excellent case why re-electing Trump is a WIN for the country. That the democratic (leftist) vision for this country is not just bad, it 's post America, unrecognizable to the values of our founding. That at the end of the \"progressive\" rainbow is not an economically equal pot of gold, but a bread line......if we are lucky, and certain equal misery for sure. A civilization where individual rights are gone and the \"collective\" good, will be decided more and more by bureaucratic overlords. I know it sounds far fetched, but if we were to go back to 1990 and explain 2020 we would sound totally far fetched. (a land of 71 genders, \"men\" having babies and having periods, marriage redefined, common core math, college kids embracing socialism, safe spaces, statues being toppled, math and grammar deemed racist, etc etc etc.)  My favorite part of the book was regarding the Russian Collusion Myth and the Ukrainian impeachment hoax. The left has literally tried twice to unseat a freely and fairly elected POTUS through the most deceptive means possible. On the flipside incidents like these have exposed much of the media as journalistically compromised and revealed a deep state with a dark agenda. Simply put America first might as well be like sunlight for vampires.  This book is worth your time and belongs with a recent list of great books making a similar case for President Trump 's re-election and America first outlook vs. the dark vision of where the left wants to take this country.  Further reading recommendation:  \"Guilty by Reason of Insanity\" by David Limbaugh  5 book reviews: Full and immediate disclosure that I m Australian. I ll remain as far below the equator to avoid the  Land of the Free  as long as I can, thank you very much.  Hi. It s me, Esther. Making myself suffer through this diatribe of a book because I  don t want to live in an echo chamber  and  believe in educating myself on both sides . These are silly tenets to hold dear in the wake of reading this, I am aware. I was going to itemise every single point made in this book and the level of their incredulity, but funnily enough, I have a life, so I left off. However, for your perusal, I include some standouts:  1. Why is it, when discussing how America is wonderful and is built on the back of freedom and not racism, does he not discuss Native Americans? Are those genocides and horrific maltreatments just ignored? The focus on African Americans and slavery is pertinent, and Hannity preempted that being raised- but radio silence on the Indigenous Peoples of America. 2. Medicare for all will ruin your country! Take it from me, in a country who has had Medicare for all since the 70s. We re completely ruined. Look how ruined we are. I had my appendix out a while back and it didn t cost me the price of a small mortgage. How horrific for me. Medicare for all would definitely destroy you, I m sure. 3. As for gun laws having no impact, we have very few mass shootings every decade. Port Arthur, the precipitating event for our gun laws, is the largest in  recent  memory. America had more than one every single day- that is, until the schools closed due to the rampant pandemic that has been spectacularly mismanaged by the government. Funny that. Hannity says it s all filtered into stabbings and the like- strangely enough, it s harder to stab over 30 people in seconds than it is to shoot them. Simple maths. 4. Speaking of pandemics- Hannity states Trump has handled the matter spectacularly. How are those mass graves because you had no more room for the dead working out for you? The drinking of bleach? The reliance on a drug proven to have no impact on the virus? All of that going well? 5. The incredible reach into the conspiracy that is the Deep State and the like. And you re still on emails? When the current administration has been using their own private server? Oy. 6.  Trump is the only way we ll save ourselves from a horrific future . Honestly, my guy, at this point, you d get a better president from using the Cheeto dust you blew off Trump and sculpting it into an effigy of Lincoln. There s little left for you in terms of good presidential options, but I can tell you that dear Donnie probably ain t it. The Cheeto dust has probably paid more in income tax as well over the last few years.  I just recommend that perhaps if any individual attached to the present administration wants to present their case, they perhaps don t rely on so many facts that are demonstrably false. But what do I know? I m just chilling here in my weaponless country, minding my own damn business, and knowing that if I need to be rushed to hospital in the middle of the night I won t need a small loan of a million dollars to have it handled. What a terrible life I lead.  6 book reviews: A Summary of His Show.  2 1/2 Stars  I am placing this Sean Hannity book firmly in the OK category. I don t watch the show regularly but the few times I have seen it, I judge the content is no different than from what s in the book.  I don t know if his purpose is to try to convert people to his way to make statements or just sell books. Therefore I didn t see anything really new in the book and such is my rating.  I am a Democrat who became a Republican and is now a hard and fast independent. So, I really didn t have any bias towards reading this book but I had hope for new ideas.  Because there were no new ideas I can t recommend this book.  7 book reviews: Even before I began reading this, I knew it was going to be inevitably biased. Sean Hannity is a fervent Trump-supporter, and anyone who watches his show knows that he will defend Trump regardless of circumstances. Having said that, I actually really enjoyed this book. Putting aside the tremendous bias, almost 50 pages are dedicated solely to citations, making many of his points very credible. Some chapters felt a bit redundant, same old \"attacks\" on the Democratic left. But, for his first chapters on American history and the chapter on Socialism, I was actually quite enlightened. Finally, his last chapters on the GOOD things Donald Trump has done for our country made me realize that there is so much MORE to the Trump administration than what we see in the news every day. There are so many policies, bills, executive orders, etc that are implemented day by day, and many are good positive things. It 's stupid to demonize our whole country 's administration for the policies they have implemented, when (if you truly look), there are so many ones that have fostered economic growth and inclusivity. We just do not hear about them. I am by no means saying Trump is an angel, but I do consider it important to inform oneself from both sides, and then form your own opinions.  8 book reviews: Get ready to die if your leaders ask you to. Hannity needs that, or what else would he report on? 9 book reviews: Very one-sided bit of drivel I ve read in a long time. 10 book reviews: Grand Slam, Sean!  Wow! What a book! Impressively written and supported with a multitude of facts. I could not believe the number of countries who tried socialism and failed. We don t want our country ruined! Everyone should read this book before voting this coming November. Excellent job, Sean! 11 book reviews: I have been reading books from both sides of the political debate of late. This book has history, information I had not heard on national news(fact checked to see if real), things that have been accomplished that have not heard of before, time line regarding Trumps actions regarding Covid. I recommend the read to anyone interested in learning...reads pretty easily. 12 book reviews: There was surprisingly a lot of information here. It s concise, no words wasted, with very smooth writing, although he is fond of sentence fragments. The pages turned quickly. It was very accessible. I was kind of hoping for a broader look at the assault on liberty. This book is more focused on current events like the 2020 election, so I expect parts of it will become dated quickly.  It s very bold and unapologetic about calling out socialists and defending liberty. The typical narrow-minded AOC-type leftist will not understand it and will be very offended by it.  The book covers a history of the country s founding, the radical left s goals, and a history of socialism, which is fashionable among the young for some reason. Next is a look at the Trump-Russia collusion hoax and the partisan-driven impeachment debacle, both with zero evidence of wrongdoing.  Then Hannity discusses the media s sycophantic devotion to the left, obsessive hatred of Trump, and their attack on free speech. Next is a quick run-down of all of Trump s accomplishments: tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses; record GDP that Obama never came close to seeing; record unemployment, especially for minorities, fewer people on welfare, and less income inequality; deregulation and energy independence, saving taxpayers thousands per household; new trade deals that actually benefit us; a stronger military and border security; expanding religious freedoms; repealing the Obamacare mandate, which hurt the poorest the most, lower drug prices, and half a dozen programs for veterans  health; right-to-try laws; the First Step Act, which reformed sentencing laws that have been extra harsh on blacks; and more.  The final chapter is a timeline of Trump s response to the coronavirus. When he put in travel restrictions, the Democrats went ballistic, accusing him of racism and panic. Now they accuse him of not acting soon enough, and as always, they re allowed to have it both ways.  (I can t believe this library book is autographed. I m tempted to  lose  it. I don t listen to Sean s radio show much because it starts off with this awful country music, but I expect a lot of this material has been said on the show lots of times.)  ==========================                                   13 book reviews: This book was amazing, I recommend every person in this country should read this. Sean provided a lot of information that was insightful and easy to comprehend, I learned a few things that I did not know. 14 book reviews: Excellent  Terrific expose of the American radical left and why Trump is the only thing standing between the destruction of America and its preservation. Highly recommended. 15 book reviews: This was an audiobook I listened to while cutting the back 40, and landscaping/ building the new front flower bed. It was written just prior to the 2020 Presidential election. Hannity still did not know if the Dems would nominate Poopypants Biden.  In the book Hannity warned about transgenderism becoming a hot button and the Dems trying to pack the supreme court. He warned that the Dems would continue to use the FBI, CIA, and DOJ as a way to punish conservatives. He warned that if elected Biden would use the \"power of the pen\", just like Obama to write executive orders to get what he wanted. He warned Biden would cave in and follow the far-left Socialist/Communist agenda of the squad. He warned that like Obama, Biden would write these orders \"KNOWING FULL WELL' that many would be unconstitutional- just as Obama had.  He railed against the mainstream media and their UNFAIR and BIASED treatment of ANY AND ALL Conservative, Republican candidates. He remarked about the lying and covering up the media does for the Democratic, liberals. All this has come true in my eyes. We see the unabashed bias and reporting every day in the news. All major networks say the same thing- many times with the exact same wording and talking points. He also warned that the Trump lives in the Dems heads and they would keep going after him whether or not he won re-election.  All have come true. Every. Last. Thing.  16 book reviews: I have seen this author speak. He seems personable and is very articulate. And I get that being in and near the political arena is his job. In this book, I liked the history and his explanations of different governments. I can even say I liked the way he dissected some of this. But what I did not like was all the name calling. It felt like playground posture. That is not helping the current politcal climate. So overall, this one was just okay for me. 17 book reviews: Liberty is our watchword. Liberty is what makes America unique. The left, by contrast, has all but abandoned liberty in favor of government-forced outcomes, though their agenda guarantees not only less liberty but less prosperity as well.  The [Leftists] reject our nation s heritage, its values, and its very founding. They want to dilute our sovereignty by subsuming us in a larger international collective and by eradicating our borders. This is the key to understanding the left today. They don t merely oppose specific American policies, they oppose our long-standing societal values, and they resent the institutions and culture that arose from those values. They have little use for liberty because it limits their ability to impose their political vision. They want to take more of your money and spend it on their priorities. And they want to dictate the most minute details of your life, decreeing what kind of straws you can drink from, what kind of lightbulbs you can use, and what kind of power your home can use.  [Paraphrasing Dinesh D Souza] Being an Indian  is entirely a matter of birth and blood. You become an Indian by having Indian parents.  And that s the norm throughout the world, but America is unique because  becoming American is less a function of birth or blood and more a function of embracing a set of ideas.   I strongly believe in helping the poor, but I don t believe the answer is the government seizing control of the economy and suppressing individual freedom in the name of  equality.  Of course there should be a safety net for the needy, but socialists constantly exploit the poor as a pretext for accumulating more power for themselves and confiscating more of society s wealth for their own ends.   Progressivism was an outlook that cared deeply about the common people and knew, far better than they did, what was best for them,  writes Wilfred McClay.  Thus there was always in Progressivism a certain implicity paternalism, a condescension that was all the more unattractive for being unacknowledged.   When a society rejects moral absolutes, it has no basis to protect individual rights against the tyranny of the majority because without such standards, any action, no matter how good or evil, and any deprivation of our liberties, can be rationalized. As scholar M. Standon Evans declared,  Moral relativism, however derived, must undermine the very possibility of freedom. No system of political liberty has ever been created from such notions, nor is it theoretically conceivable that one could.  All forms of despotism throughout history, Evans observed, have sprung from moral relativism. For freedom to exist there must be basic assumptions about the intrinsic dignity of human beings.  Every [Democratic] candidate at the February 7, 2020, debate either cosponsored or supported the Green New Deal, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez s utopian plan to remake the American economy at a cost of unknown trillions of dollars. Indisputably, Democrats have become the party of socialism, open borders, sanctuary cities, the elimination of ICE, underfunding the military, abortion on demand, infanticide, environmental extremism, gun confiscation, higher taxes, radical identity politics, suppression of free speech and religious expression, and, among some Democratic members of Congress, undisguised anti-Semitism. They re also the party of intolerance, smears, lies, character assassination, besmirchment, and fake Russian dossiers. They are singularly obsessed with their hatred for President Trump and his supporters. As the Brett Kavanaugh Senate Judiciary Committee hearings showed, they have abandoned any sense of fundamental decency, fairness, or common sense.  The promise of this country has never been income equality. Its guarantee has always been, and must continue to be, opportunity for all. Forced equal outcomes are themselves unfair and destroy liberty and prosperity. We must never let the American people or their elected representatives be held hostage to radical mobs who threaten social unrest unless their socialist demands are met, and who offer social peace only in exchange for our abandonment of the American dream.  The left generally believes that economies are finite, which means that if the wealthy get wealthier there will be less for everyone else. Free market advocates know that economic growth expands the pie, and that one person s gain is not necessarily another s loss. Indeed, studies show that even when there are increases in income inequality, there is not generally a decline in upward mobility.  Any Democratic debate on policy descends into an argument about identity politics. Democrats can t offer any policy solutions without falsely accusing Republicans of bigotry. They never claim Republican policy proposals are simply deficient it s that all our policies, from the economy to abortion, are grounded in hatred for some group. Democrats have gone to the well too many times with this tactic to the point of parody and it s bound to backfire as ordinary Americans grow weary of being constantly accused of prejudice every time they disagree with some left-wing policy prescription. Instead of uniting us as a people, it divides us as oppressors and oppressed, white versus minorities, gays versus straights, and men versus women. The Democrats can t win an argument on the merits, so they resort to inflammatory accusations in a desperate and socially destructive attempt to conceal their lack of constructive ideas.  [Hugo] Chavez introduced many programs to fight poverty and assist the poor, including low-income housing projects, literacy programs, free health care, and food subsidies. While those programs were touted by his leftist international supporters, they proved to be utterly unsustainable when his overall socialist economic program wrecked the economy. Forced land transfers, land expropriations, and increasing state control led to a 75 percent drop in food production over the following two decades as the Venezuelan population increased to 33 percent. A vast program of nationalizing industry spread corruption and dramatically suppressed operations in electricity, water, banks, supermarkets, construction, and other industries.  [Bernie Sanders] called for state control over the main levers of the economy. That is what socialists want because that s what socialism means. According to socialism, free individuals can t be trusted. Why government bureaucrats are smarter or less selfish or less corrupt than businesspeople remains to be seen. But if a socialist gains power, this state of affairs has the benefit of concentrating far more power in his or her own hands.  In the Clinton impeachment, the president has the right to have his counsel present, to cross-examine, to call witnesses, to submit evidence, and to build a defense. Schiff conducted his witness depositions in a basement of Congress secret testimony recorded in secret transcripts. He barred most Republicans from attending and from reading the documents. Those Republicans who were allowed to take part were barred from calling their own witnesses or issuing their own subpoenas. Even when they were allowed to ask questions, Schiff often directed witnesses not to answer.  We saw this play out in the media s adoring coverage of the Obama administration. For instance, after Obama halted America s  wet foot, dry foot  policy, which has permitted Cuban refugees who reached our shores to enter the country, the next morning the three major broadcast networks spent a scant sixty-eight SECONDS covering the story. But when Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning immigration from several Middle Eastern and African countries, they spent sixty-four MINUTES on the news. As NewsBusters noted,  The coverage of Trump s executive order has been overwhelmingly negative, with NBC s Today even suggesting a link between Trump s immigration ban and a mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec, despite a complete lack of evidence.  There you go when Obama blocks refugees, it s a nonstory. When Trump does it, it s a form of mass murder.  The Pew Research Center analyzed the media s coverage of Trump s first sixty days and found it was far more biased than it was for the three preceding presidents. The Trump coverage was 62 percent negative, compared to 20 percent negative for Barack Obama and 28 percent for both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Only 5 percent of the Trump coverage was positive versus 42 percent positive for Obamaa, 22 percent for Bush, and 27 percent for Clinton.  I have consistently defending the First Amendment rights of everyone in this country, including members of the media and Hollywood elite whose opinions I find repugnant. I can give you chapter and verse defending various liberal figures to voice their most noxious views. I ve taken some heat for that, but principle is principle. We must not confuse their inalienable right to free speech, however, with immunity from criticism. We have a duty to criticize politicized and dishonest journalism, and I have tried to do my part. The liberal media fraudulently hides behind the First Amendment when caught in their lies. And they use it to intimidate their honest critics, cynically depicting them as authoritarian speech suppressors. By deliberately spreading disinformation on a daily basis and dedicating all their considerable power to ousting a democratically elected president, the mainstream media has well earned the moniker  enemy of the people.   [John] Tierney is right about these  younger progressive journalists  who try to get their conservative counterparts fired and banned from social media platforms, lobby Amazon to ban conservative books, and organize advertising boycotts against conservatives, which we Fox primetime hosts are routinely subjected to. Tierney makes a point I often make:  They equate conservatives  speech with violence and rationalize leftists  actual violence as   speech.  These virtue-signaling liberals are ever more dangerous to free speech for conservatives will inevitably, someday, boomerang back against the left.  18 book reviews: This was written before the 2020 election. Sean opens the book up with a warning of the danger that far left radicals within the Democrat party will pose on our nation if Donald Trump is not elected to a second term intern.  Unfortunately it appears that Sean is correct as we have seen thus far the slow destruction of our economy through inflation, an energy crisis with unprecedented fuel prices and the encroachment of divisive, perverted leftist values on our vulnerable children in schools.   Obviously this era has come to an end as we can see the brazen and open abuse of power today in our federal government.  Hannity discusses American exceptionalism and the shared beliefs and values that bind us as a nation. The many contributions that the United States of America has shared with the rest of the world.    -Sean discusses the founding of America, the Mayflower Compact and the ideals of self governance.  -Discusses how the United States of America was founded upon Christian ideals and provides ample evidence of this. He also acknowledges that 52 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, as well as the vast majority of the signers of the Constitution were devout practicing Christians.  -Discusses the rejection by progressives of the notion that we are born free and of God given natural rights as intended by the founding fathers. Instead progressive thought argues that these natural rights can only be bestowed upon by the state or government or government as far as it is in the best interest of the state and the collective.  -Moral Relativism versus Moral Absolutism.  -He discusses the radicalization of the Democrat party and their march to socialism as establishment Democrats are pushed more and more to align with their radical base, the new far left.  -The Democrat 's lies and vilification of Donald Trump and their endless stream of false accusations.  -The \"Green New Deal\" - Socialism disguised as environmentalism. Even AOC 's chief of staff admitted the \"deal\" had nothing to do with environmentalism, but was intended to radically change the economy.  -Obscene tax hikes and the Democrat 's disastrous spending and economic policies.  -The Democrat 's barbaric, inhumane, and murderous stance on late term abortion and infanticide.  -The Democrat 's socially destructive obsession with identity politics.  -The horrifying nature and failures of socialism and communism around the world.  -The giant Trump-Russia hoax and the fact that the Muller probe, which took over 2 years, did not find a shred of evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.  -The unprecedented abuse of power by the FBI.  -The main stream media 's spin, lies, and visceral hatred for Trump. Numerous examples of that.  -The media 's undeniable partisan bias following their gushing love affair with Obama.  -Cancel culture and multiple examples left 's attacks on free speech, particularly in universities.  -All the many successes and economic progress made by the Trump administration despite being ignored and denied by the partisan media.  19 book reviews: SUBJECTIVE READER REVIEW WITH PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOWS:  A major opus, published just in time to chronicle the watershed event of America, the 2020 Presidential Election. I will give Hannity his due; he thoroughly researched the four+ year storyline, the common denominator being the Democratic Party 's enduring denial over the results of the 2016 election. But while recovery from loss, or grieving, normally includes five steps, the Democrats have gone directly from denial to revolution.  It has been plausibly posed that the overwhelming disbelief held by Hillary was directly associated with her ASSURANCE that ballot fraud had won her the election. Close associates of mine attribute it to the redneck rebellion. I personally feel that the patriotic people of America took a stand that stopped socialism on the steps of the US Supreme Court. Sean Hannity quoted Reagan in this book, \"Freedom is but one generation away from extinction.\" I will go ahead and summarize the choice laid out in 'Live Free Or Die' in three words: LIBERTY VERSUS ANARCHY.  Hannity lays out the process that most of Donald Trump 's successes have been forced to take: a constipated House, solely focused on impeachment; the President 's issuance of Executive Orders to gain inertia; the liberals filing suit to obviate by injunction; and finally, the Administration winning in appeal to overthrow the injunction. Helluva way to have to achieve greatness, but Donald Trump is a stubborn Patriot bent on a continuance of the Republic and democracy as laid out by the Founding Fathers. Here 's the bottom line that Hannity and I share: the day we deny that the light of God leads us is the day that liberty dies. And neither of us is ready for that yet.  Incredibly, although Hannity lays out the organized nature of the rioting and looting completely embraced by the liberal Democrats, he never mentions Obama 's 'Organize For Action,' which in most playbooks is the backbone of the protests if not the riots, along with Antifa. From an objective point of view, what should the average American 's reaction be to the riots taking place in the big Democratic mayor cities? Arm up, because our sense of survival is clearly threatened, and all other aspects of life wither in the prospect of annihilation.  I noticed 'Live Free Or Die' had an average Goodreads rating of 4.28 stars. If I had to point to a weakness, it 's the first fourth of the book. Hell, I considered shelving it myself over boredom...but I somehow could not put it on the shelf. The last half of this book will make you aware, if you were not already, that a Democratic win in November spells the end of liberty as we know it. I do not think American Patriots, veterans and people who believe in Christ are ready to abandon the great experiment just yet. Heroic piece of work Sean Hannity!  20 book reviews: I found this book at Costco. The title sucked me in as \"Live Free or Die,\" is the state motto of my home state, New Hampshire. Politics are divisive these days and this review is not that. It is an honest look at the book.  One of the things that struck me right away is that the opening chapters are a condensed civics lesson about political science in general, that does not lean toward the left or right. These chapters focus on what the founding father intended when they wrote the Constitution, and what topics they intended future generations of Americans to tackle within the framework of their guidance. As I read these chapters, I thought back to my major in college (political science) and a lot of what Hannity was writing about were the very topics I discussed and researched as a poly sci major. That alone was enough for me to know that the author was coming from a grounded place with this book. This presentation gave the points he made a lot more weight in my eyes.  There are chapters on basic government, socialism, the Russian collision, and impeachment. Hannity also tackles the mainstream media bias. There 's also a comprehensive timeline on the government 's COVID 19 response. Every topic is laid out logically. Hannity 's writing style is easy to read and understand. The depth and complexity of the Russian collision topic was explained well, and in such a way that made me feel that the author was not condescending to me, the reader.  This book is a must read. The author 's conviction and passion for political science, recent events, and love of his country shine through. For reader 's who embrace and believe that socialism is a political platform that our government should follow, this book is not for you. This book is well written and the arguments well presented. I would recommend this book for those voters who are looking for an honest assessment of the current political climate.  21 book reviews: Worthwhile Listening Cover to Cover  Occasionally I watch Sean Hannity s television program. At first, I wondered if I needed to listen to Hannity read his LIVE FREE OR DIE audiobook.Then I was hooked and heard it all. The book crystallizes the issues and results of the last three and a half years of President Donald Trump. This book is full of research and quotations from Democrats and Republicans.  Each chapter is well-written and insightful. I found it valuable listening and heard this audiobook from beginning until the end. If you need to figure out how you will cast your vote for president in 2020, then I highly recommend a careful listening to LIVE FREE OR DIE. Sean Hannity definitely gives you the insights and ammunition you need to make an informed vote. I enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.  W. Terry Whalin is an editor and the author of more than 60 books including his latest .  22 book reviews: Sean did a great job of highlighting the promises this president made to the american people and kept. However the most important point of the book is how the left in this country has done nothing but try to subvert this president at every turn. Never in the history of our country has a president been so harshly criticized for every move he makes. The main point is how the left is driving our country to socialism which is one step away from communism. All of our brave heroes fought and died in our wars to fight this very thing and now so called americans are trying to destroy us from within. This should be required reading of everyone before they make an intelligent decision at the voting booth. This should also be required reading in every high school and college in our nation. Great job Sean!  23 book reviews: Sean Hannity is a talented writer, whose book, kept my interest at all times. The author loves America. He does not want American Exceptionalism to be a thing of the past. Author Hannity gives facts as well as opinions about what is really going on in the Political Scene. One must also remember that most of the media are not for President Donald Trump. For this reason alone, I feel this is a very important book to read. Sean Hannity sets the record straight on many of President Trump 's accomplishments. I highly recommend, \"Live free Or Die\" to the Independent Voters, Democrat and Conservative as well.  24 book reviews: This book mostly presents facts, not author 's opinions. Details many Trump administration 's accomplishments and campaign promises kept which some news outlets and politicians appear to be willfully suppressing or misrepresenting. There 's an entire chapter which highlights all the steps taken to deal with COVID 19 25 book reviews: EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK 26 book reviews: Should be a required read for everyone before the election   27 book reviews: The one thing a reader can do to understand what their in for when reading, Sean Hannity 's, Live Free or Die is when opening the book, just take a moment to look at the table of contents. This outline frames the choice given: Live Free or Die, and it also somewhat shows a timeline. I do not know if Hannity did this on purpose, but I am guessing he did because from listening to and watching his shows, I know, he poured his heart and soul into writing this book. Basically, the TOC shows the book in 2 parts, from the Introduction to Chapter 4 and from Chapter 5- 10 and a conclusion. The intro brings us Sean 's stark warning, with a summary of the political landscape where we are at as a country, and the fork in the road before us, as we continue our march to November 3rd. Chapter 1 goes over the framework of our country and how this framework blessed so many because it gives the freedom necessary to pursue dreams along with the risk needed to drive those to succeed. This type of energy is the gift that keeps on giving, and as a society and a people, we all work together producing a culture of success and the entrepreneurial spirit that America has not only successfully developed but maintained for hundreds of years. But it also has made us the envy of the world, and that envy ca not go unnoticed because many countries with tyrannical governments, and thus many failures, would like nothing more than to see America brought down to her knees. This is where we are introduced to the radicals of our country in Sean 's early chapters. The Democrat party is no longer your grandparents Democrat party. I could have been a Democrat when Democrats were about helping fellow countrymen and countrywomen out of hard times. When working to alleviate areas in our society that were unfair and inhumane. These were the things the Democrats once stood for. But somewhere along the line, the radicals came and started gaining ground in political, and cultural areas of our society, and as they did so successfully they became even more radicalized. And now we are dealing with the most radical party in the Democrats we have ever seen and experienced. These are really Marxists ready to shove down our throats their wish list of what they believe will give them a socialist utopia, but would crush our economy, kill America 's entrepreneurial spirit and along with it our freedom. Countries have fallen to such regimes and have fallen to communism, and countries like Venezuela under total tyranny. Read Chapter 4 of the many examples of what happens when a country becomes communist they eventually turn socialist and their people end up suffering and dying. The examples in this chapter will break your heart and to be totally honest freak you out. So, as I was saying there is a timeline here between the Introduction and Chapter 4. We have our country 's framework blessing us beyond belief and making our country the greatest in the world. We then have radicals wanting to change our country and make it what they think would be their perfect vision, their utopia, and with these radicals there are foreign entities who see their opening, making the radicals unapologetically anti-American, and bring their wish list that will only turn our country into a socialist nightmare and destroying America once and for all. All this would have already happened if it was not for Donald J Trump. Donald J. Trump intercepted this football and ran with it. Thank God. So the 2nd half of this book, reads much like the timeline from when President Trump took office and took away the power from these insane radical Democrats. Losing the power they were abusing for years, and years, as the establishment, as the deep state, they hatched plot to take him down, with the phony Russia hoax and to their galling attempt to impeach him. Along with all this Sean explains how the media is weaponized against him (and us) and have abandoned all journalistic integrity and even though phony, unbiased reporting, and now are all in to destroy him (and us), leading them to lose much of their credibility and like in the case of Sandmann millions of dollars. Sean then lays out all the tremendous accomplishments that President Trump has delivered, even in the face of such thug politics from the other side, and even with the constant attacks that are never ending in the media. I especially loved how Sean also described how Trump rolled back so many of Obama 's God awful executive orders and the deals he was making with other countries, undermining America 's greatness. He also describes Trump 's terrific response to COVID and offers a conclusion that sounds rather hopeful then as dark as his introduction. Again showing a timeline, his introduction talked mostly about Obama and what Obama did to us and his conclusion speaks about Trump and what he 's done for us. There is no doubt the choice is ours; we need to re-elect Trump, so that we are not back where we were when Trump intercepted the football and where we were on the precipice to America 's ultimate demise.  28 book reviews: Live Free or Die is a book written by Sean Hannity to not only share his intense and loyal conviction to conservative politics, but, it is also a volume, that strives to convince the reader that the last four years in the White House under the leadership of Donald Trump were, as opposed to the stories provided by most media outlets, not a travesty but a triumph. It is likely that many people, simply seeing this volume in a store, would be provoked to anger, and they would simply consider it to be right winged propaganda. However, after reading his book, I am convinced that Mr. Hannity, himself, truly believes what he is saying, and, most likely, lives by those principles as well as he can. It also taught me something else. That many of us are seeking for truth, and we are having a hard time finding it. I, for one, believe that standards of journalism are at an all time low, not just because opinions are now being touted as fact based, important accomplishments by government officials are being degraded or omitted, and facts are being misrepresented, but because, sadly enough, many, if not most of those, that have the responsibility to provide us with factual information, have, for some reason, mislaid their professional integrity, ethics, and independence.  For example, as I read this volume, I discovered that many actions performed by the White House over the last four years, mainly by the President, were simply not broadcast, because reporters were too concerned about impeachment trials and removing the current President. Consequently, successful agreements made in the Middle East, efforts to stop Covid 19, steps to promote religious liberty, and strides in criminal and justice reform, to name a few, were never shared with the public. At any rate, regardless of what political view a prospective reader may have, what we really want is truth, and I believe that this is one commodity that has recently been lacking within this country. For that reason I was impressed to see that this book, which Mr. Hannity admits required a great amount of help in writing from his staff due to his busy schedule, has a 50 page bibliography. Now, I admit that some of the bibliography may include \"right wing doctrine,\" but in my purview, I found nothing but facts supporting the book.  One other matter I believe this book successfully shares is a discussion on the principles which originally formed this country and what it stands for. This book describes the formation of our union, and the reason that the Constitution of the United States is such an important and timeless document, and why current law makers should make sure it is protected, because of the inherent rights that it provides every citizen of this country regardless of our race, gender, or beliefs. Those rights include the way we vote, how we are protected within and outside our borders, and how we are defended in this country 's courts. When our current lawmakers insist on degrading this ageless instrument, then we can consider that our rights are hanging by a thread, and our freedoms are in danger.  I apologize for sharing some of my own philosophy in this review, but I almost ca not help myself during this alarming time. I highly recommend this book, regardless of your political leanings. If you read it with an open mind, you will learn.  29 book reviews: I am clearly not the audience for this book, but the summary looked interesting and Mr. Hannity has a large audience and I think it is important to develop empathy for a variety of views.  There are a lot of concerning things in this book that I will discuss below but here is a summary: 1. No thesis for this long book 2. Lots of naming calling of Mr. Hannity s enemies. The name calling seems to be an attempt to dehumanize his political opponents and to build a stereotype of their views. This is unnecessary at best and extremely dangerous at worst 3. Socialism - There is a long rant about how socialism is terrible and will destroy America but Mr. Hannity doesn t clearly address that there are degrees of a socialist society. He focuses on Marxism which somehow he feels that he needs to systematically discredit while tying American Democrats to it. Nothing in the Democratic position papers or in the majority of democratic American s are indicating that we need to wage class warfare and put all industry in the hands of the state. A. There is a lot of discussion of failed Marxist states but nothing about successful social democracies like France, UK, the Nordics. Americans want something more like those societies. B. As an aside: American s are saying that the way things are now is not working well enough and it could be better like: There is an unnecessary healthcare burden on our citizens and our businesses that could be better serviced centrally. We need to be more environmentally responsible than we are now. We need to offer social safety nets without moral strings attached. We need to provide better educational opportunities at the university level and at the vocational level. 4. Russia Probe - There are pages and pages rehashing this all to say that the whole thing was a waste of time and money but this is what happens in a democracy. When our leaders potentially break the law we investigate, sometimes impeach and then we move on. Outside of Mr. Hannity s audience, I have yet to have a conversation about Trump and Russia or Ukraine since the end of the impeachment. It s over. Whether we agree with the result it is over. Why are we continuing to rehash it? America really doesn t care about Russia, Ukraine, the Steele dossier, or any of it. We know it is all a mess and we just want someone to fix it. 5. The Media - How does Mr. Hannity spend so much time attacking the media, of which he is a part, without acknowledging his role in the media (he does occasionally mention this but for the most part he just goes on about the liberal media). Why is FoxNews a special snowflake? No one thinks the other news programs are objective...everyone has a bias...yet Fox spends so much time talking about the liberal media. I don t see CBS or the Wall Street Journal or NPR attacking the conservative media constantly and complaining about how they don t get fair treatment. 6. Trumps Successes -  The left hates us because we empowered Trump, and they hate Trump because he disempowered them.  This is not why we hate Trump (although I don t care at all about Trump, I hate the way he acts, and most of his policies but I don t know him), we  hate  Trump because he doesn t represent us and because he is not how we want to be seen as Americans. A. Regarding his successes there are some positives but then we get to Mr. Hannity s view of Mr. Trump s handling of COVID-19 the wheels fall off of the bus. This was too public and too recent to spin positively. Everything about COVID-19 has been a disaster. Mr. Trump refused to overreach when he should have (masks, social distancing, unity) claiming states rights but then feels comfortable overreaching with Federal power when sending in the national guard.  There is so much throughout this about the media hating Trump...which is probably true...because they reflect the views of most Americans. Many Americans find Trump to be distasteful and in no way an accurate representation of the America we live in or want to live in. We are indifferent about him as a human being but we absolutely don t want him as our global representative.  This book reads like a Fox News extended rant, which I guess it is. There is no clear thesis, and the book as a whole is messy, unfocused, poorly researched, and terribly executed. There are long chapters defending President Trump s record on Russia and subsequent impeachment and on Mr. Trump s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Russia section takes forever and it appears that Mr. Hannity has somehow written this without actually reading the Mueller report. I wasn t aware that this was still an open issue that we needed to rehash after the impeachment trial. I really don t know why Mr. Hannity brought this back up and I have no idea how it relates to defending our freedom and liberty.  I believe the premise of this book, based on the title, is that America is under attack by someone or something and that unless we do something we will die. Mr. Hannity is not clear on what the attack is, who is doing the attacking, what we need to do to defend ourselves, or even who will die. I can t tell if we will personally die or if America will die.  If you want to understand the American conservative view point this book will not help you...I have been actively reading on this subject and I am really struggling on what you should read to understand it but it is not this. George F. Will s  The Conservative Sensibility  is better but it doesn t provide any answers just retrospective nostalgia as policy. Dinesh D Souza s  United States of Socialism  is a better choice for understanding socialism from a conservative point of view. Don t read this book if you want to learn something and certainly not if you care about the future of America because you will not find answers in these pages.  ",
    " Magnolia Table, Volume 2: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering": "book reviews: I was disappointed in the lack of heart and personalization that made me love the first cookbook so much. Joanna says right at the beginning that she basically used up all of her tried and true favorites in the first book, so this is just a bunch of new things she and her team threw together to make a second cookbook. Some of the recipes looked intriguing (I made the french toast this morning and it was delicious) but almost none of them had descriptions or a story behind the inspiration, which made this cookbook feel very flat to me.  1 book reviews: Magnolia Table, Volume 2: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering (Hardcover) by Joanna Gaines offers a delightful array of recipes that cater to various tastes. While some dishes may not align with our culinary preferences, the collection boasts fantastic staple recipes. Despite individual preferences, the overall compilation impresses with its sheer beauty and diversity. Among my favorites from this cookbook are the after-school banana bread, deviled eggs, scalloped potatoes, grilled salmon, and the exquisite strawberry shortcake with whipped cream.  2 book reviews: Tons of info with gorgeous photos. I really like the substitute section and herbs combo. Plenty of recipes that I would love to eat, but not make myself.  This was a library loan and was unavailable in kindle format. It was useless to bookmark or highlight anything unless I borrow it again. 3 book reviews: It is not every day that I do something new for a book review. After so many years of posting weekly, I have pretty much read and reviewed just about every kind of book there is. That 's what makes this review such a rarity. For the first time in the history of A Book A Week, I am reviewing a cookbook! Now, anyone who knows me outside of the book blogging world knows that I am actually an avid home chef. I love trying new recipes and spending time in the kitchen. I am also a fan of home and lifestyle guru Joanna Gaines. I fell in love with her design and family while watching her hit HGTV show Fixer Upper. I have read her book about the founding of her company, and have enjoyed watching her turn her humble little Texas design shop into a full-on empire. Her first cookbook was a wonderful mix of family recipes, photos, and stories. When her publisher offered me a copy of her next cookbook Magnolia Table, Volume 2, I jumped at the chance to give it a read!  At first, I struggled when trying to figure out how to review this one. Usually, I can just summarize the plot of the book and give a few reactionary shots. Somehow that did not seem like the best approach for a cookbook. A book can look great and be aesthetically pleasing, but the recipes have to be cookable. I mean, if the food is not any good, the book did not really do its job. And so I did the only logical thing I could think of in this case. I dove into my kitchen and got to cooking.  A recent article said that the demand for yeast has grown around 647% since the COVID-19 outbreak. It seems that being forced to stay home has inspired us all to try our hand at bread baking. I will be the first to admit that baking is not my strong suit, but I am fortunate to have a boyfriend who is a master at all things baking. One perk of being forced to stay home is that my house has kept a steady supply of fresh baked goods. This week just so happened to have a loaf of home-baked brioche, the perfect base for trying out Gaines 's French toast recipe. Armed with all of the proper ingredients, I set out to give this recipe a try.  One of the great things about the recipe, from the very start, is that the ingredients are all pretty much staples in most kitchens. With the exception of heavy cream, I had everything ready to go. While that 's not necessarily the most important thing in judging the effectiveness of a recipe, it is certainly helpful right now. My local grocer has been pretty hit or miss when it comes to having even common food items in stock. The only thing I ended up omitting was the Strawberry Butter. I could not get my hands on Strawberries, so I used just regular butter instead. No one 's ever complained about butter of any kind at my house anyway!  From there the recipe was fairly straightforward. Gaines suggests keeping a wire rack on a sheet pan in a warmed oven to keep the French Toast warm. This was the kind of helpful hint I always appreciate in a cookbook. You could really tell that she tested this out in her kitchen with her family. The toast is cooked in batches, so this tip ensured the complete serving was hot at the end of cooking. I am normally not a huge fan of sweets, but this French Toast recipe was a perfect balance. Crunchy on the outside, softer on the inside, well seasoned, picture-perfect. I was honestly most surprised at how pretty my plate looked. It was so appealing, in fact, that I almost did not want to eat it. Almost.  Magnolia Table, Volume 2 serves as a wonderful companion to Gaines 's first cookbook and is sure to inspire creativity and gathering with the recipes it contains. The French Toast recipe was simple to prepare but super tasty, the kind of recipe that I can easily foresee being added into the rotation of staples at our house. Something new to this installment is a brief guide to herbs and seasoning substitutions. This illustrated guide includes suggested parings and spice blend recipes that are informative and integral to having a basis for preparing recipes. Glancing through other recipes reveals that not only are they mostly minimal effort with the maximum end result, but they are also endlessly riff-able. I could see myself mixing and matching seasonings and sides to create more unique dishes. Whether you are an avid home cook like myself or a more novice chef, I think Magnolia Table, Volume 2 would make an excellent addition to any home kitchen.  4 book reviews: I m a sucker for Joanna Gaines. While I do not share the same design aesthetic she does, I m obsessed with the recipes she shares. I think Volume 2 is better crafted than Volume 1. I will be testing many recipes in the near future. 5 book reviews: Made a few things out of this since receiving it for Mother s Day. The roasted chicken and vegetables and cabbage rolls were very good but not at the top of my favorites list. I also did a variation on the cabbage rolls that had a Far East flair with notes of sesame, peanut, soy, and ginger; my family enjoyed the swap out. My favorite  by far  thus far has been the blueberry sweet rolls with a fresh lemon glaze. While they don t contain cinnamon when made as directed, they re better than any cinnamon rolls I ve ever made  softest, fluffiest texture I ve ever achieved, especially when eaten the same day as prepared. A little firmer the second day, but as good the second day as most yeast-based dough is on the first. Huge fan of always using fresh lemon zest and lemon juice rather than extract, so I was glad to see the recipe called for such: the difference is most distinctive. I have a plethora of ideas on how to modify this recipe for completely different, exciting flavor variations!  6 book reviews: One of the most dull cookbooks I ve ever read in my life. There are no inventive recipes at all, simply Joann going through a list of classics that people have already nailed. I was SO disappointed. 7 book reviews: I cooked all 145 recipes- yippee!! Not all were winners (looking at you stuffed grape leaves), but all helped me become a better chef. Mostly, I loved being able to use  cooking through a cookbook  as an opportunity to gather my people together and feed them. The year brought joys and sorrows (as years do) and these recipes are now a journal of sorts honoring the memories and the people. Thank you to my Guinea pigs and to the people who kindly listened to me talk about this adventure over and over again- we did it! Now on to cook Volume 1!  8 book reviews: I became an official fan of Joanna Gaines during the quarantine when I watched her cozy home cooking shows filmed by her adorable children.  She 's affable, I like the way she speaks, her cooking style but, most of all, I love seeing her close knit family and how they all interact with each other.  Like her first cookbook, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 maintains the same aesthetic, it 's sturdy, heavy with quality paper.  The recipes are not eye-catching or unique, as some reviewers have noted, but the photographs are beautiful though I wished there were more photos.  A pet peeve of mine regarding cookbook is there are never enough photos.    Overall, the recipes are easy to follow, and most of them have tasty titles so if I was inclined to cook, I might make a few of these dishes.  9 book reviews: Another great cookbook by Joanna Gaines that convinces me we could easily be BFF s. I love the simplistic layout of each recipe and the font is easy on the eyes. The pictures (one for each recipe) are beautifully photographed and bring a sense of calm to me. No matter how my dish turns out, I love the calming stages food pictures. They just remind me that some of us appreciate good food made with love. I did enjoy the first cookbook more just because it was more personal to their family but there are many yummy recipes in this one! Try the Honey Garlic Chicken first! Page 233!  10 book reviews: Beautiful photos and lots of ca not wait to try recipes. My only complaints - wish there was more personalized stories/descriptions with each recipe and most of the baking recipes require a stand mixer. 11 book reviews: Pictures of recipes? Not all are pictured. Commentary on recipes? Sometimes. Nutrition facts? No. Recipe Style? Standard American, I suppose. Any keepers? No.  It feels like I have seen the vast majority of recipes here before.  12 book reviews: Some of these recipes are really good. tried a simple one and came out delicious. Cannot wait to try more. 13 book reviews: Reading cookbooks is a hobby all of its own-I just love it. So good to dream of the family memories around these recipes! 14 book reviews: This is just as beautiful a cookbook as the first Magnolia Table Cookbook. I have had the luxury of tasting 4 of the recipes served to me by my daughters. I loved all four: Ham and Spinach Puffs, Pretzels, Cheese sauce for the Pretzels and Creamy Chicken Poblano Soup. I also made her Pecan pancakes and the Bacon Cheddar Breakfast cups. They were also delicious. (all made and eaten while in Covid 19 Quarantine.)  I flagged many of the recipes I want to try, to the point that my husband who watched me one night, asked why I did not just flag the ones I DON'T want to try. Ha ha.  15 book reviews: Felt pretty impersonal and like the publisher wanted to just capitalize off of the first cookbook. The little antidotes felt forced and there weren t any special, unique recipes I haven t seen in other cookbooks. Of course, the photography was gorgeous, but the real Joanna Gaines charm was missing. As a side note, ALMOST EVERY recipe contains some sort of dairy product, so vegans and lactose intolerant readers be warned. 16 book reviews: Everything Chip & Joanna do is outstanding, and this book is no exception. Beautifully created book, recipes, pix, stories, etc. It s fantastic. 17 book reviews: So much better than her first, in my opinion. I only took away 2 or 3 recipes from her first. This one feels much less forced, not so much of a perceived desire to impress, just really good recipes 18 book reviews: Seen it all before.... 19 book reviews: I think that everything Joanna touches turns to gold anyways but this book is just another notch in the book of fab. I am no different then Joanna, when her introduction talks about how food is not just a means to an end but a whole experience. Food allows people to come together and bond over something delicious and comforting. Food to me is a whole experience; that starts with an idea of what to cook and ends in a feeling and experience when you are serving and eating. That 's exactly what this book does. It feels comfy, homey, but also gorgeous and classic. Nothing is pretencious and everything is super easy for all skill levels. All the way down the the editing of the photos and the texture of the pages it makes me want to be on the farm surrounded by animals and lush green pastures. Total fan girl.  20 book reviews: This was a great book with lots of interesting recipes!  Also, there were lists of Fresh Herbs, what they look like, their flavor, and uses; Herb Pairings and pairing suggestions; recipes for Seasoning Blends; a two-page spread of substitutions.  At the end of the book is an Index.  21 book reviews: Lovely photos, but I wouldn t expect anything else from Magnolia s style. Recipes were fine if a little run of the mill, like that the ingredients aren t esoteric. Zucchini cake will be tried. 22 book reviews: I really like Joanna Gaines style and cookbooks. I have her first one and like this one b/c it has recipes that are a little different to try. Nicely, made Book with clear directions and pictures. 23 book reviews: The kind of feel-good, home-cooked recipes that you want to add to your family 's weekly menus 24 book reviews: Very good arancini and marinara - beautiful pictures too 25 book reviews: I generally found this book to be disappointing compared to the first book. I wanted more anecdotes and musings by Joanna, because the recipes are (for me) secondary to the story that she weaves in with each one. The first book had more Joanna and thus more substance for me as a reader. I was underwhelmed by the recipes and the recipes chosen. There were only 2 or 3 that I actually want to try because they sound interesting and worth the effort, as opposed to her first book where I tried many of the recipes - some hits and some misses - and enjoyed the experience.  I found that a lot of the recipes that she included I had found elsewhere with almost the exact same instructions and ingredients but done by home cooks and bakers. It always makes me cringe when I see that, because despite the whole test kitchen and test recipes, if the recipe is the same as what I have made time and time again without any variation, is it really something you have perfected?  I only give it 3 stars because I am still a fan. As a cookbook, I would be hard pressed to give it a 2.  26 book reviews: Loved this latest book from Joanna Gaines. Great recipes and stories. 27 book reviews: I have always loved to read cookbooks and Joanna Gaines is one of the best. She has the same likes that I have in d cor and cooking.... it keeps me inspired to keep things fresh and neat. Spring cleaning, cooking for loved ones is an absolute joy and she hers books help me with new look or add ons to the table. 28 book reviews: Spent the afternoon completely devouring the book! Beautiful and sooo many recipes I cannot wait to try. Loved the 1st volume and it is my go to. This one will also be on that list! Highly reccomend! Check this one and her previous book. You wo not be disappointed! 29 book reviews: A good size book (8 x 10 inches) that, even if you do not use it to cook from, will look impressive sitting on your counter. Some nice photographs and some of the recipes have little stories prior to the ingredients/instructions list. Mostly very common recipes in all the major categories that you can find in any cookbook or on the internet. If you are a fan of the Gaines 's, you will enjoy this book and it is a handy, basic reference for good, everyday type recipes without too many exotic ingredients. If you are looking for cutting edge culinary adventures, this is not the book for you.  ",
    " Midnight Sun": "book reviews: Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTok   I was still a teenager when I first read TWILIGHT, and now I am... well, not a teenager, obviously. (Beware, kiddos who follow me, one day, you too will be one of the \"olds.\") Since that first initial read, I have reread TWILIGHT a handful of times, and each time, I have felt a little differently about it as my thoughts about feminism, young adult fiction, and romances slowly changed and evolved with my own self-identification over time. I eventually settled on a sort of affectionate resignation. No, TWILIGHT wo not be winning any female empowerment awards, and it 's all too easy to make fun of (whether it 's vampire baseball, sparkling in the sunlight, or the infamous misuse of the word \"nattering\"). But it was a book written by a woman for young girls that somehow became overwhelmingly popular a cultural phenomenon, and women really did not get to have a lot of things like that. Most things in pop-culture are created by dudes, from the perspective of the male gaze, so it was refreshing to see a romance novel become so inescapably popular that it gained a firm toehold in the fantasy/paranormal literary canon .    Even if the heroine was a klutz with zero self-preservation.    I actually read the original version of MIDNIGHT SUN back when it was still available to read for free on Stephenie Meyer 's website. I remember when she first announced the project, she got for it, and everyone said she was greedy/milking the cash cow/etc. (and yet radio silence when every other romance author decided to copy her and write POVs from their own abusive heroes' perspectives). I remember there was a lot of drama because someone had leaked the chapters, and they were circulating the internet, and Meyer was mad and said something like, \"I am not going to write this anymore because if I did, I would let James win and kill off all the Cullens!\" And in a final \"so there!\" she had posted a PDF version of the leaked chapters on her own website. Which... yikes. Not yikes to Meyer but just yikes because I honestly felt so bad for her at the time, getting all that hate and then someone screwing her over like that. I would probably want to red wedding my own characters, too, at that point. So I read the 12 chapters on Meyers' website and went on with my life...    Until our year of 2020 when Meyer announced to the world that she would FINALLY be publishing MIDNIGHT SUN, the rewrite that nobody asked for. Or... um, wait, actually I think LIFE AND DEATH was probably the rewrite that nobody asked for. Anyway, people took in this news and basically lumped in with the general craziness of 2020 but they also had Thoughts. I had Thoughts. Namely:    1. Ummm, okay, that 's great and all but WHAT ABOUT THE HOST SEQUELS.  2. And why does that cover make me so uncomfortable? It looks soooo sexual.  3. There is no way that this is going to be good but I am a trash can-- we all know that I am a trash can-- and TWILIGHT was my shit back in the day, so we all know I am totes mcgoats reading this.  4. I REGRET NOTHING.  5. Does this mean that vampires are FINALLY becoming popular again?  6. Just kidding. That was a trick question because we all know vampires never left.    Anyway, I finally got my hands on this book and managed to read it in a day with some skimming and all I can say is HOLY HELL WHY AREN'T MORE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WHAT A CREEPS MCDEEPS EDWARD IS. Like, yikes. If you thought he was problematic and patriarchal in the firsts four books, grab a blowtorch and some mace, because he takes stalking and problematic behavior to serial killer heights. Where it 's methodically breaking down how he would go about meticulously snapping the necks and killing everyone in his biology lab in order to get to Bella while her blood is still warm, or stealing what I believe was her house key (some kind of key) while sniffing her hair and then OILING HER WINDOW TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SNEAK INTO TO WATCH HER SLEEP, Edward is the King of Creepy. And what makes it worse is that he knows what he is doing is creepy and he literally does not care.    Another thing that I found really funny in this book is how Stephenie Meyer really tries to give us a reason as to (1) why every single heterosexual man with a functional penis pants after Bella in the books and (2) belatedly and retroactively tries to infuse her with a \"personality.\" What results is that we are treated, through Edward 's psychic powers, of the inner monologues of EVERY MAN in this book who finds Bella attractive and told over and over again how dazzling, how stunning she is that she leaves boys literally unable to think while speaking with her-- and she does not even know it! Bella dramatically understates her own worth and Edward finds this so charming, compelling, and appealing that he has taken it upon himself to act as appraiser. Which is... gross. But gross is a recurring theme in this book, just as another recurring theme in this book is every attractive woman who actually knows she 's attractive being repeatedly looked down upon, rejected, and shamed.    Woo, feminism!    Through Edward 's eyes, we are told how selfless and good Bella is. They have a conversation that definitely was not in the first book and felt about twenty pages long (I think it was actually ten) in which Edward asks Bella all of her favorite things, and she answers, so we learn her favorite flower (dahlia), candy (black licorice and sour patch-- is she an old lady??), and ALL OF HER FAVORITE BOOKS which we already kind of knew about from the previous four books, but now in addition to the Jane Eyres and Jane Austens, we are informed that she loves Robin McKinley and the Dragonriders of Pern series, and oh yes, Agatha Christie! She 's BRANCHED OUT!    I must say, this book felt about a thousand times longer than it actually was. In addition to the long odes to Bella courtesy of Edward 's being psychic, we are also treated to long and waxing odes of how rich, attractive, and amazing Edward is, courtesy of his being psychic. One creepy thing in this book which I am really not seeing mentioned more in the reviews of this book is how Edward allegedly looks seventeen and yet a number of older women-- adult women-- in this book are panting after him and fantasizing over him, EVEN THOUGH HE IS A TEENAGER. I am sorry, that 's gross. That 's just as gross as a one-hundred-and-four-year-old man panting after a teenager.    Which is another thing that makes this book creepy. Being inside Edward 's head, we find out just how unequal their relationship is. Edward holds and is over a century old, and yet he does not like women of his own age and does not like women who have sexual agency (they seem to make him feel some weird mix of scorn and shame). Instead, he goes to a high school, where he sneers at the biology teacher for not knowing as much as he does with his ~sniff~ two medical degrees, and tunes in to his fellow \"high school students\" like he 's watching a soap opera on the radio. Like... why?? If I was an immortal psychic vampire, high school is the literally last place I would go. I would be on a remote island somewhere with my own personal library, or travel the world. I certainly would not be looking at lab slides and writing out prophase, anaphase, interphase.    TWILIGHT works because it 's written (allegedly) from the perspective of a teenage girl who does not feel like she fits in, who feels like she 's more mature for her peers, who feels like she sacrifices endlessly and nobody knows it and she does not want people to know it, but also she does. She whines about attention while craving it, and even though she 's annoying, she is also a perfect stand-in for the walking, irrational paradox that many teenage girls (and boys, and people) are. It works. And how many of us, told that \"things will get better in college\" have not innocently fantasized about a dashing older man (or woman) who would sweep us away from high school and tell us we are special and also a secret princess or heiress or faerie queen or whatever? Everyone wants to be special, especially people who are not. So, even though TWILIGHT does not really make sense, and Edward is ridiculous and toxic AF, the fantasy is appealing because it taps into Bella 's desire to be seen and, yes, special.    MIDNIGHT SUN, however, does not work-- because it rips the sparkly tablecloth off that fantasy, revealing the horrors underneath. Edward is dangerous. He 's a stalker, he 's a bit of a psychopath, he has anger issues, he 's jealous, he 's possessive, and he 's one-hundred-and-four years old and in love with a teenager, and because of that discrepancy, he feels like he knows what he wants better than she does-- because he 's an adult, and she 's the irrational, and naive teenager. In this book, it 's no longer romantic; it 's creepy. As we see Edward not through Bella 's rosy lenses but through Edward 's own, we realize just how creepy he is. So if this was an attempt to rationalize and humanize Edward 's behaviors, it failed, because it only served to make him 10x creepier. But if this was Meyer 's attempt to be like, \"ha ha! you want dark?? I will give you DARK,\" then she succeeded, because man, Edward is super scary and I want no part of him. Team Jacob all the way, thanks. At least he 's her own age.    The only thing this book really succeeded at was filling in some of the bizarre plot holes from TWILIGHT, such as why the tracker did not recognize what Bella was right away at the baseball game, and why, between Alice 's mind-reading and Edward 's psychic powers, Bella ended up having so much bad shit happen to her in this first book anyway. I did not ask for MIDNIGHT SUN and I am not really sure it adds anything of real value to the series, apart from doubling down on the Edward is Creepy vibes from the previous book while trying to ret-con Bella 's vapid, schoolmarmish character based on criticism from the first four books. Only one of those things was successful, though, and I do not think it was the one that the author was going for, sadly.    1.5 to 2 stars  1 book reviews: I have never in my 23 years of life been more excited to read a book and I am not ashamed! I loved reading this, but I did not necessarily love this book. Bear with me, I will explain!  This book is not perfect, and I did not expect it to be. It has many of the major criticized flaws of Twilight, in terms of instalove and questionable romance.  It is a Twilight novel after all, and if you are one of those people who absolutely hate sparkly vampires and all that comes with them, this is NOT the book for you. This book was written for the Twihards. It was written for everyone who had been eagerly awaiting this installment for over a decade. For those of us who recognize flaws, but love it nonetheless. So, if you know that you are going to hate it, do not read it for the lolz, and do not ruin it for those of us who care about it. Please. That 's all I ask.  Meyer 's prose has grown and greatly improved in the past 15 years since Twilight first came out. Many of us have laughed at infamous lines such as:  (Which is a misquote, by the way. It 's actually:  In New Moon, chapter 21. Look it up!)  Thankfully, we have grown past that mess in . The writing was, surprisingly, actually one of my favorite parts of this book.  . Do not go expecting a new story because you wo not get one. What you will get is a new version of it with far more detail and development than we see in the original novel. Meyer took the opportunity in this book to expand and develop a lot of things that were left vague before, and I appreciate that. The vampire world seems bigger here, the characters seem like they could, with some effort, be real people!  I am extremely biased as I have always been #TeamEdward, but I genuinely enjoyed the look into Edward 's thoughts. He is still a vampire stalker, but he is also shockingly self-aware and not nearly as perfect as Bella thinks.  Shockingly, the biggest surprise for me in this book was Bella herself, as she too appears more human in this book than in . Do not get me wrong, There are conversations between the two characters that are only alluded to and skipped over in , which were fully fleshed out in this book. Perhaps it 's because, in , Bella was too infatuated with Edward to pay attention to small, trivial conversations. In , Edward is so infatuated with Bella that he considers all those trivial conversations vital to her character. Either way,  All the other characters are also shown in greater depth in this book, mostly, the Cullen clan. This is because Edward can read their minds and therefore see their true selves and hidden motives, while Bella 's POV is blinded by their beauty and perceived perfection. Emmett was my favorite because he was the only one aware of the fact that Edward was clearly crazy.  I will say this though, it sucks that all the human characters lowkey suck. I mean, they sucked in too, we just did not realize how much. Even Rosalie, who has a genuinely horrifying, tragic backstory of being used and abused and left for dead, is reduced to a horrible, jealous mean girl, and I did not like that. Rosalie deserves her own story being told because none so far have done her justice.  In the end, this book was good and I highly recommend it to any fan. Keep in mind that this is literally the plot of the original .  I kept waiting for certain things to happen and would get annoyed when I realized how early on in the story I still was, despite having read so many pages (this is a 658-page, 240k-word novel). It s about twice the word length of the original novel! But,  I attribute the annoyance to knowing all the major plot points from . I was waiting for things to occur, waiting for my favorite scenes to come up, and waiting, finally, for the action to happen.    And yet, having read this, I somehow feel complete. I have been waiting for this book for a decade, and I am so happy that I could finally get my hands on it. I can die happy in knowing that my last impression of was not that awful , gender-bent nonsense. Seriously,  was a trash novel. , on the other hand, was everything I expected it to be.  #TeamEdward  2 book reviews: Just released my Top 10 Books from 2020 BookTube Video - now that you know this one made the list, click the link to find the rest!

Hello audiobook.    This book made my heart happy. It was everything I had hoped for in Edward 's perspective.  | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  3 book reviews: This book is 1,800 pages long.  I am not fact-checking myself, but rest assured it feels in the foundational religious text/600-level STEM textbook range.  And I read every one of those proverbial tissue-paper pages. (I did not actually read a hard copy of this. See below hinting.)  And yet, I have exactly one note.  That note is:  Helpful? No. But it made me laugh. So thank you, past Emma.  To be honest, I really liked this book at first. It almost...concerned me. It would have been devastating to my brand and image to genuinely enjoy a Twilight book in 2020.  But thank god Stephenie Meyer saved me from herself.  Because this got old very, very quickly.  Twilight power rankings - 1) Alice 2) Charlie, the only cop I respect 3) Edward  And yet this book still was not good.  Being in Edward 's head gets old. I ca not imagine how he did it for 11,000 years before creeping on a child.  But let 's get out of here before we have to start considering the morals of this series.  Bottom line: Do not - Read this book. Do -  ----------   well. i did it.  but at what cost????  review to come / 3 stars  ----------   LET'S! GET! READY! TO! SUUUUUUUFFER!    ----------   what better way to spend a summer than by reading thousands of pages' worth of sexually frustrated vampires  ----  i already swallowed my pride and added the old edition of this book...now i have to do it again?!  13 year old me better appreciate this  4 book reviews: i would like to thank not only god but mormon jesus for bestowing this gift upon me in the year of our lord 2020  let 's all stand for 672 pages of murderous, horny edward  ---------------------------------------  review:  i had going into this book what i wanted it to be. i read the original 12 leaked chapters back in the day and just like everyone else i craved an entire tome. but i am that we did not get the release 12 years ago. the wait was undoubtedly worth it.  this book delivered every unanswered question, every charming moment with side characters, every piece of internal dialogue from edward. we get to see edward at his most depraved, his most happy, his most anxious. we get to experience him falling in love. and it all made if you find yourself wondering upon reread of twilight why the two fall so quickly, i feel like this book answers that question. and for all detractors of edward, i think we get a really convincing look at his attitude toward his relationship with bella (i.e. consent & respect king).    ---------------------------------------  also! if you love the twilight series, i think it 's important to know that the real Quileute Tribe has not received any compensation from either Stephenie Meyer or the series/movies/merch (despite their culture and legends being misappropriated in the books). currently the Tribe is trying to move some of their buildings (such as their Tribal school) to higher ground because they are in a tsunami zone. here 's a link to understand more/to donate!    5 book reviews: My 13th self: 5 STARS!

Here are my thoughts, all the cringy Edward moments and new infos: https://youtu.be/VBhw0_0QxpM 8 book reviews: Look, I m doing this for high school Lindsey. She had to suffer through the low-rise jeans phase, so I owe it to her.  Even though she and I will NEVER be cool with Bella s floor-length khaki skirt.    Update: DNF at 34%  Look, I can t do this even for low-rise jeans high school Lindsey.  I d like to say she d understand, but the day Stephenie Meyer posted the leaked chapters on her website, high school Lindsey drove to the public library after school just to read them. And she loved them.  High school Lindsey was a moron.  Edward s POV adds nothing new to the story. It s mainly just him going on and on and on and on about every little thing. So much so that I, an annoying AF over-thinker, couldn t tolerate it. Bella may be one-dimensional, but at least she knows how to move the plot along. Edward is incapable of doing so.  Also, a lot of the dialogue didn t really make sense from his POV. It s almost as if Stephenie Meyer was writing all of these inner monologues for Edward and then remembered she needed to include the dialogue from the first book, so she just plopped it in random places. None of his thoughts are snarky or amused, but his dialogue certainly is. The two don t match. And yes, yes, I m aware not everyone says what s they re thinking. But, there were parts in Twilight where he seemed genuinely amused by Bella. Yet, none of his thoughts reflect that. Thus, it feels patched together.  Really a shame this didn t come out 14 years ago. High school Lindsey would already own a pillow case of the cover. As it is, present day Lindsey is still suffering from the effects low rise jeans had on my hips, SO I AM NOT EVEN SORRY FOR QUITTING THIS.  9 book reviews: 5 stars    For just a second, I saw Persephone, pomegranate in hand. Dooming herself to the underworld. Is that who I was? Hades himself, coveting springtime, stealing it, condemning it to endless night.   Midnight Sun is a book I ve been waiting for for over 12 years and let me tell you, it was so worth the wait! I honestly thought this day would never come and as soon as I saw the book was available, I preordered the hardback for my collection and the audiobook. I listened to all 25+ hours of this and the narration was AMAZING. Jake Abel did a fantastic job voicing Edward. I can t recommend the audiobook enough.  I loved being in Edward Cullen s head. Absolutely loved it. Yes, this is a retelling, but this is much longer than and so much was expanded on. I loved getting more from the Cullen s and with Edward being able to read minds and all, you really did get to see more from so many of the other characters in this book. Plus just knowing Edward 's side of things and what he was really thinking was truly a treat! I also have to say, I think Stephenie Meyer 's writing has only gotten stronger with time.  If you re a diehard fan of the Twilight Saga like me, I highly recommend giving this one a go!  10 book reviews: Omg! THIS book was EVERYTHING! Please for the love of everything, Stephenie, write the rest of the books in Edward s perspective!!!   I only put in a few quotes, but I will return with more at a later date!!    Holy shit snacks!! I love it so much! It s so damn different and cool!!      I love how Edward talks about reading his families minds and the different thoughts and struggles. I really wish Stephenie would do the whole series in his perspective!             to be continued.....    Mel    BLOG:  11 book reviews: Pre-reading review: Let s be honest, I hated Twilight. I *loved* hating Twilight. Terrible as they were, those books had literary merits of a Twinkie - and were just as addicting. And now this is out, and can I really think I have the willpower not to read this sparkly creepy vampire opus?  Also, what the hell is that cover??? It s seriously creepy. Pomegranate   or a partially dissected heart? Reminds me of anatomy lab and all that formaldehyde smell...     Reader, I finished it. . That s some self-discipline, mixed with masochism, apparently.  700+ pages of the story of the first book, told through Edward Sparklepire s eyes. 700+ pages of overly-wordy, painfully bloated overwritten narration that does not dare skip ever the most insignificant detail or word.  But hey, I can sum up the first third of this magnum opus pretty succinctly, courtesy of RiffTrax guys and           We already knew that cute subtle sparkly sheen was the skin of a killer. We knew Edward Sparklemeister was an angsty broody uptight guy with serious control issues and obsessive creepy stalker/ abusive boyfriend personality. . Literally the opening scene of this book has his internal monologue bitch and whine about everyone and everything around him, including his family.    This book is much MUCH longer than Twilight - probably because in addition to we also get, via his eavesdropping mind-reading ability, constant recaps of Bella s conversations with other characters. And *everything* that those characters thought, in strangely coherent sentences.  It s the sheer number of details. About everything. Obsessively. Twenty pages of Edward interrogating Bella about her likes and dislikes. A page and a half of Sparkly Sparkleson choosing a shirt to wear. An hour of reading dialogue describing everything from Bella s favorite color to favorite bands to favorite books to her favorite ... Pardon me, I must have dozed off from boredom here. Sufficient to say that    - No problem, let s cram every single detail about her here to refute that.  - No problem, let s make sure that every character surrounding her here thinks such a barrage of vile thoughts at her that by contrast she appears to be Heaven incarnate and  - No problem, let s just insert a billion justifications about how he totally respects Bella s choices and how what would seem to be controlling and stalkerish behavior totally isn t, and Except when the creepy is still there (since Meyer wrote it twice already):     And the language. Oh, the Bella-levels clumsy language () and overwrought descriptions () and clunky metaphors ().    Her skin reflects no such thing. Apparently she s corpse-like in her translucent paleness and you keep emphasizing how translucently pale she is. Eddykins, you are just making sh*t up now.      Holy crow, as Bella would say. Sparkleson, your actions seem to trigger some serious arrhythmia in your girlfriend. You may want to think about EKG. Two medical degrees, Doctor Sparklepants   you know this could be deadly.    - A few times hopelessly smitten women literally think when ogling the marble Adonis that Edward is. How often do you see an attractive person and proceed to actually verbalize in your head, ? I never have - but maybe I way too busy actually swooning rather than thinking (Also,  swoon  no longer seems like a real word).    What the hell IS wrong with Bella? Those balance and coordination issues are way more than endearing clumsiness. Did she have a stroke? Does she have a brain tumor? I mean, a person should be able to walk on a flat surface without tripping for at least a few steps, right? Did you say TWO medical degrees, Dr. Sparkletoes? You never considered asking your girlfriend to get a brain MRI?    Stephenie Meyer doesn t know how human sense of smell works. Or maybe I m a vampire, too.     Dear Edward Sparklepants. Strange unfamiliar reactions deep in your core? Don t you have two medical degrees and a lifetime spent in biology classes? I know you re a 100-year-old virgin, but you must understand, no? It s arousal, buddy. You are simply horny.           12 book reviews: is this a book we all really needed? no. is this a book we all deserved? you better believe it.  reasons why i gave this 5 stars - nostalgia and edward. thats literally it.  and honestly, i wish SM had written the original books from edwards POV. i enjoyed this soooo much more than  twilight  because i dont have to deal with bellas whiny thoughts. lol.   13 book reviews: Is COVID-19 making authors finish their projects? Maybe George R.R. Martin is next? Megan Whalen Turner? Patrick Rothfuss? (Searching for silver lining very hard here.)  I never even cared about this, but life as it is now, I might actually partake in some sparkly icicle camp. Too bad it 's not going to cover Breaking Dawn s most freaky events, amirite? #icicleoflove     14 book reviews: I m swimming at the complex feelings sea, keeping my head above as forming thought balloons. I wish I read this book 10 years ago. It should have been released as soon as the trilogy has ended so I could have given my five shiny stars because this book is definitely written better, bringing out more clear perspective to the characters  stories, their motives. But it is still flawed and there are still plot holes, logical mistakes.  But right now, everything has changed: my taste of music, food, literature, movies completely evolved. In last 15 years I became vegetarian, yoga instructor and cut the alcohol, meditating daily, supporting Republicans. Okay, I take them back. Especially the part about my political choices ( don t worry I didn t lose every marbles in my head. It was my coldest joke. After writing it, I m still shivering!)  I didn t radically changed but I m not in my twenties anymore and I am not fan girl of Edward Cullen. Now I m in my forties and I m fan of new Batman. (See, my tastes are already evolved. I m not obsessed with blonde, charming Brit and I don t cry each time Cedric Diggory dies when I watch Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire! Okay, this is another lie! Of course I m crying! )  I have to admit this book is great contribution to the series and writing still is obviously so much better. I truly loved to be inside of Edward Cullen s head and it already filled so many blank points about him and Bella s story.  He is not perfect. He is tormented by his inner feelings: animal inside of him tries to slake his thirst. And his human parts start to discover Bella s attributes which help us look from the different mirror to the character and understand how she is so unique. ( Actually we also learn more about her high school friends who were mostly hatable! I really question author s reasoning to create those irritating friends group reminded you of cheesy 80 s thriller movie characters who were extremely stupid and became first ones to die! Maybe their only contribution was emphasizing Bella s incredibly perfect attributes!!! )  And I m still lost why Edward deeply fell in love with Bella. It is still instant, too quick.  The pacing is good but it is still too much wordy. If I haven t been inside one of my favorite characters  head, I would scream him shut the hell up and tell me his shorter version of the story.  And of course we already know the entire story. So there is no surprising element! (Edward could have killed Bella, imprinted on Jacob which would be my all time favorite alternative final!) So we keep living deja vu, time traveling, remembering our past reading journey over and over again.  But this book reminded me of how much I liked Emmet and Alice as supporting characters and I m so happy to spend longer time with them.  So it is belated meeting and back to past, tribute to one of the most popular trilogy kind of reading for me. I wish I wouldn t take so much time to come out and I wish it could be a little shorter. I didn t fall in love with it but I didn t unlike it. It s a solid three starred read for me. I had fun to go back and meet with the characters, rekindling my memories. But that s all. Unfortunately this is not extremely exciting, earth shattering experience for me.      15 book reviews: I loved Twilight. Fuck all y'all haters. I have been salivating to read this ever since that partial first draft of the original Midnight Sun got leaked years ago.    But after reading this? I wish Stephenie Meyer had just pulled on her big girl panties and finished it Edward was too breathy and overdramatic. He came across as one of those bitches who would willingly saw his penis off as an apology for you with his boner. Getthefuckoutofhere.    The first few chapters were the hardest, because Edward sounded like such a poncy twat that I really did not know if I wanted to keep listening to his inner monologue. He was so condescending and obnoxious, it just felt like his thoughts were on a repetitive loop.  That schtick that got old. Fast.    I will admit that as the story went on, he really did become a lot more tolerable. Gotta be honest though, he was as charming as I remembered. One (petty) reason is most likely because I imagined this super hot guy when I read the book a million years ago. I ca not remember what that dream man looked like now, however, because I have an image of Pattinson stuck in my head. This is the image I wanted. The guy who played Edward is one of those rare people who has two faces. I will look at him from one angle and think, Then he tilts his head a bit to the left? That 's a skill an actor can use right there.    Anyway. The whole book was probably a bit marred by those terrible movies and the actors who played the roles. What did they do to make them look that way - paint them with chalk each day on the set? They were supposed to be pale and attractive, not look like they would been dipped in white-out.     Ugh. I ca not know for sure how much my loathing for those movies to taint my viewpoint, but I that I preferred the characters that I would imagined a long time ago more than what I kept seeing this time around.    Alright. I get it. This is supposed to be a representation of how you feel in the throes of your first love. But I honestly do not remember being fucking dramatic. Maybe I was. I am willing to admit that I may have forgotten what it was like to think of a man as the all-encompassing center of my universe. Yeah, yeah. I love my husband...but not like . This is just a lot of teenage nonsense. They are both virgins who have never been in love (or even dated anyone) beforehand.      And that 's ok. It 's part of what 's so fun about occasionally dipping my toes back into the Young Adult genre. You are giving yourself permission to forget reality and pretend that breathy sighs, chaste kisses, and holding hands are what makes the world go round. You can believe that your love for this boy will make up for the fact that his family are all raging lunatics that you will be tethered to till the end of time. <--it 's all good.    At any rate, I finished this for nostalgia 's sake. But I ca not say that it recaptured any of that original magic I felt when I first read the books. But I am a glutton for punishment, so if she makes a New Moon version from Ed 's point of view? Yeah. I will read that bitch. <--not even ashamed!  16 book reviews: 17 book reviews: It takes another kind of genius to sell us the same story three times and still get us hyped up for it.  Twilight has it 's flaws. This we know. This we acknowledge. It 's like one of those low budget soap operas. You know it 's terrible shit, but you also ca not stop yourself from watching the next episode.  Well that 's how it is anyway.  If you are thinking of picking this up please know that it 's basically the story as (book 1) with a few added parts since (unbelievably) Edward is not always glued to Bella 's side.  Even though this book took me ages to read, I laughed at all the cringey scenes I got a tad bit annoyed at the sense of deja vu but then again I have read and reread this series waaaaayy more times than I would like to admit.   I always used to think of . But I kind of get her  allure  to Edward now. Edward is very perceptive and I liked the things he noticed about Bella 's character. The way he is able to read minds and NOT able read Bella 's mind means that he picked up on all her little quirks and sees her in a different light than she sees herself. . *GASP* I honestly cannot believe I just wrote that.  I have also always been hardcore #TeamJacob (do not come at me for that) but reading from Edwards POV has nudged me just a tiny bit to the other side. He 's . I loved reading about his inner turmoil and the way he justifies his crazy actions. However the dude is still a creepy stalker ( #TeamJacob4evaaaaa).  In we not only get Edward 's POV but also his insight and the thoughts he reads through other people 's minds. Which was fascinating!! I honestly do not know how he stays sane. Learning more about Edward, Alice and Jasper 's powers/abilities was so cool.  I loved the flashbacks. We got to know more about Edwards early days, more about Carlisle, how Alice and Jasper joined the family and other fun stuff!  Bella is an outsider looking in to the Cullen crew. But . Those were some of my favourite parts of this book.  Rosalie is one of my favourite characters. Yes, she 's a bitch. But I love it. The more in depth version of how she found Emmet had me almost in tears (okay that 's a lie. I in tears). It was beautiful.  Every single time Edward referred to  the monster inside me  . It was just so cringe. And it happened so often I started laughing everytime he said it.      It would have been better if was first written with alternating POV from both Bella and Edward. But I am glad I read it. It 's for those of us with a sentimental attachment to these books and these characters, those of us who have been waiting years for Edward 's side of the story.  I highly recommend the audiobook. The best part of this whole experience was having Jake Abel and his beautiful voice in my head for hours (I swear that sounded less creepy in my head. clearly Edward 's creep vibes have been rubbing off on me). He did a phenomenal job at narrating.       18 book reviews: \"Could a dead, frozen heart beat again? It felt like mine was about to\".  Han pasado 84 a os  y nunca cre  que este libro me fuera a gustar tant simo. De verdad, desde que le mos Twilight, siento que hemos pasado a os avergonz ndonos de todo lo que signific  esta saga en nuestra adolescencia.  Y qu  sentido tiene eso? Fueron libros que disfrut , que am , que me acompa aron cuando m s sola me sent a y que me dieron algo con lo que so ar,  saben? As  que creo que es hora de dejar los prejuicios tontos atr s y aceptar que estos libros a muchos, incluida yo misma, nos cambiaron la vida.  Honestamente, empec  a leer con esa mentalidad de  uy, qu  boleta leer esto despu s de tantos a os , pero lo que me encontr  fueron much simos recuerdos espectaculares. Me emocion  de la misma manera que cuanto ten a 16 a os cuando le  la escena en la que por fin Edward y Bella hablan civilizadamente. Y cuando se tocaron por primera vez. Y ese beso cauto. Ador  volver a sentir esa felicidad y emoci n que me causaron esas escenas hace tant simos a os.  S , tenemos que admitir que Edward es todo un de proporciones  picas, pero una vez entiendes por qu  piensa as  y te acostumbras a ese tono, es imposible no devorarte el libro. Estar dentro de su cabeza y ver de primera mano la necesidad sobrenatural que tiene de proteger a Bella hace que, de nuevo, todas sus actitudes tengan sentido. Obviamente algunos de sus razonamientos s  que son un poco exagerados, pero cuando te metes en el mundo del libro y piensas que es un vampiro tratando de combatir la sed que le produce la sangre de la persona que m s ama en el mundo  bueno, las piezas encajan.   Saben qu  otra cosa me pareci  tremendamente fuerte?  Lo mucho que las pel culas deformaron mis recuerdos del libro original de ! Madre m a, todas las escenas que son s per de la pel cula SON INVENTADAS. Leer me record  que la conversaci n sobre Edward siendo vampiro no sucede con di logos dram ticos en el bosque, sino en el Volvo, cuando est n volviendo de Port Angeles. Que el primer beso no es en la cama, sino en el bosque y, de hecho, no en ese momento, pero en todo el libro  se besan much simo m s que en la pel cula! Dioses, tantas cosas.  Ah! Por ejemplo, en la pel cula suavizan un mont n el rechazo de Rosalie por Bella y lo que quiere hacer, mientras que en el libro esa mujer es tremendamente desagradable. Ni siquiera cuando est n en peligro los ayuda.  Creo que una de las mejores cosas de estar en la cabeza de Edward es notar todo el amor y admiraci n que siente por su familia. Menos por Rosalie, que en un punto la describe como un charco superficial (). Es muy impresionante que, a ra z de haber le do ahora Emmett se haya vuelto uno de mis personajes favoritos. Es el mejor hermano que una persona podr a desear y am  su pasi n y fidelidad, pero tambi n su despreocupaci n.   Y qu  decirles de Bella? Es tremendamente diferente verla desde los ojos y la perspectiva de Edward que leerla a ella misma. No lo recuerdo muy bien porque, total, han pasado siglos desde que le  los libros originales, pero tengo la sensaci n de que leerla a ella pod a ser, en ciertos momentos, desesperante. Y eso no me sucedi  en . Puede ser porque lo vemos todo desde la perspectiva de Edward, que est  enamorado, pero en este libro Bella me cay  muy bien y se presenta como alguien cero dram tica, bastante centrada y buena. S , sigue siendo torpe y la muerte la persigue, pero creo que verla como Edward la ve crea un personaje much simo m s interesante y .  Sin duda, adem s de todos estos sentimientos locos y adolescentes que reviv , una de las mejores partes es el final, cuando empieza la cacer a de James. Es muy fuerte leerlo todo desde la cabeza de Edward porque, como entiende el peligro tan real que supone ese rastreador, queda totalmente trastornado. Y luego la persecuci n, las pistas falsas, las visiones de Alice, el escape de Bella, el robo de carros, las carreras a lo y el encuentro final en el estudio de ballet.  Todo eso es una descarga de adrenalina demasiado  pica! Y, luego, obviamente, esa escena tambi n la deform  much simo la pel cula. El combate y las heridas son much simo m s brutales en el libro. Y la tensi n que se siente cuando Edward tiene que morderla para quitarle el veneno es de otro mundo.  Pero, claro, algo dur simo de leer en este final es, precisamente, lo culpable que se siente Edward por todo. Nosotros, en los libros originales, no nos enteramos sino hasta que  l pretende irse y alejarse para siempre. Pero en nos damos cuenta de Edward lo planea todo desde el momento en el que vio todo lo que le sucedi  a Bella. Su sentimiento de culpa y su odio a s  mismo es tan grande y lo consume tanto que no puede pensar en otra cosa. Y, obviamente, vivimos todo su proceso de saber que debe dejarla, pero que no sabe si podr  hacerlo porque la ama demasiado. En fin, que s  que es muy revelador estar dentro de su cabeza.   Pensamientos finales?  Am  el libro y cada una de sus casi ochocientas p ginas! Hac a much simo tiempo que un libro no me hac a sentir tanta emoci n y angustia y desesperaci n y felicidad. Fue una monta a rusa de recuerdos y de revivir el amor por una saga ic nica. De verdad, mientras le a todo creo que escuch  ochocientas veces o . Y, cuando lo acab , lo primero que hice fue maratonear todas las pel culas. Fue incre ble que, gracias a este libro, pudiera vivir momentos de felicidad y cero ansiedad. Y, de verdad, ahora lo  nico que quiero en este nuevo resurgimiento de mi etapa es que venga Edward, me muerda y me convierta en vampiro. Da igual si brillo o no, jajaja.  19 book reviews: If I could give this 1/2 star I would, but you know the way the rating system works on Goodreads...This is ai not it folks. This really did not do anything for me.  If you know me or if you have been following my journey in re-reading the Twilight series then you know that I have not been enjoying any of these books. It 's been a rough journey, but has also given me better insight to understanding why and how this series is problematic. I wo not lie; I was curious about how Meyer would frame this book in context of the original book. My curiosity was not enough to even begin to make me like this book.  Let 's get the easy part of this out of the way. is boring. I know everyone was/is super excited to see Twilight from Edwards perspective; however, there was no reason for this book to be over 600 pages. We literally revisit every scene word for word with Edwards insight tacked on. By the time I was 50% into the book it began to feel very long and drawn out. Her technical writing skills have improved; however, her ability to write a compelling plot has not changed. Would it have been a better book if it was shorter? For me, probably not because the content itself is still problematic; however, I think it would have been an easier read. An interesting part of this book is that Stephenie Meyer essentially attempts to re-write the book in a way that attempts to get rid of the critiques that she experienced with the first four books. In doing this, she recreates characters that are not true to the source material which was WEIRD. For example, I thought Bella was a bland, boring, and insensitive character in Twilight. In she becomes this well rounded, interesting, and compassionate character. I am not sure if she was attempting to paint this picture that Edward was seeing Bella through rose-colored glasses, but it did not make sense. There were also scenes in Twilight that were incorrectly translated over to Midnight Sun as if Meyer did not even attempt to re-read her own work before writing .  Now....what I ca not seem to understand is how 10 years later Meyer still has the monopoly of writing problematic crap. I feel like she attempted to keep the Black family out of this book as much as possible because she received so much backlash for her portrayal of the Quileute tribe. She still could not get it right. There was a line in the beginning of the book in which Meyer allowed Edward to say that he had no problem SLAUGHTERING the entire Quileute tribe because he felt that Jacob broke their treaty. First, the imagery that this brings to mind is disgusting. Second, think about the fact that it is a White character saying this. I do not think that this was appropriate in any world to write that line. Then there is the issue with Edward acknowledging that he is no better than a peeping Tom and that he 's a stalker, but continues to stalk her anyway. It 's almost as if Meyer believed that if she acknowledged the behavior then she would not have to fix it. There was also this weird alignment with God and Carlise. Do not get me wrong Carlise is hands down one of my favorite characters; however, I found it very awkward that she had Edward describe Carlise as this a Christ-like figure. It was clear that she still wanted to make sure that she wrote herself and her beliefs into the book. There is still a whole aspect of control on Edwards part and the inability of women to be able to define their own lives. I feel like Meyer intentionally wrote all of the other high school students as villains so that should justify the isolation that ends up occurring between Edward and Bella. I just did not feel comfortable with a lot of the contents of the book.  There were a few things that I did like about the book including the scenes where we learned more about the Cullens and some of the back story about the final scene. Was it enough to save the book? No. Will I be reading anything else in the future? No. I appreciated having open and candid conversations about these books, but I think, for me, it 's time to close the door on this series.  20 book reviews: this was the most bizarre mix of returning to childhood while also having that childhood ruined. it really put a damper on twilight 's barely tolerable creepiness to learn that even when edward is not noticeably with bella, he 's always lurking in a tree outside her house or something. a book i thought would take me a weekend to devour ended up taking 3 weeks, so let that struggle speak for itself.  (random sidenote: one thing i did not expect from this was how much more i came to love emmett)  21 book reviews: I finally finished Midnight Sun, so here is a compiled list of my Thoughts   * most days I can hardly muster 3 words to describe my overall existence, but my boy Edward here spends pages describing how Bella s eyes react to the light and let me tell you, that shit is lit    *  A word I d never said before in the presence of a lady slid between my clenched teeth.  - Edward, honey, it s fine, you can say fuck    * Edward Cullen falling for someone - a reaction in 5 steps: - shout NO dramatically in front of your family - view this as a and a - stalk out dramatically out of the house, into the rain - writhe internally in agony - run through the mountains, in the rain, contemplating your existence, like the dramatic queen that you are  * - I dare y'all to name a more dramatic, over the top bitch than Edward  my life is agony  Cullen  * Edward Cullen discovering jealousy: - yes boo, welcome to the highs and lows of Feelings   * - name   a   more   dramatic   bitch    * Edward s idea of a  state of undress  is wearing a short sleeved shirt, i m howling; for real, he is in mental anguish over wearing that shit  * - Edward, honey, I like you boo, but what the FUCK  * Edward literally decided to think all the thoughts and use all the words in the dictionary. All of them. Just  why the fuck not  * Emmett is the one reason to give this book a try. He constantly calls Edward kid. His general attitude towards everything is a flip between yolo and  can i murder that . He s basically like  edward, man, you re fucking weird, but i m bored, so let s do this, i guess   * - a Very Dramatic way of saying that you re horny, courtesy of Edward  my mind is impure  Cullen  * this book had NO business being as long as it was, but it was peak nostalgia  and i loved every second of it  * at the same time, i swear to fuck, i don t think i ll ever reread it, edward s mind is an exhausting place to live in lmao  22 book reviews: \"A girl can dream.\" \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster.\" \"Not exactly. Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\"  ~ ~ ~  \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Is not that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough. Enough for forever.\" This time I spoke of the real forever. My eternal forever.  Guess who enjoyed her re-read? And it 's not even like I read a new plot it 's the exact plot of Twilight just in Edward 's POV. But much more better. This book took me by surprise.  Compared to Bella 's perspective and Jacob 's (in Breaking Dawn) I found Midnight Sun to be much more insightful, which makes Bella 's perspective a bit dull. We see the internal struggle Edward has to deal with to be around Bella and his journey from hatred to curiosity to eventually love. We get to see the conflict between Rosalie and Edward and how close Emmett and Edward were. These things were not picked up by Bella.  The fact that Edward was so much detail oriented, attentive towards Bella is heartwarming. My guy remembers everything about her.  One thing that I found interesting was the encounter with Siobhan. I ca not believe how underrated she is in the Twilight Saga. The woman 's gift is to visualise outcomes and will it to reality. HOW IS THAT NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH?! Does not that make her even more powerful than Aro? It baffles my mind.  Apart from that, the number of beautiful quotes this had in it made me swoon. Edward is such a romantic at heart despite his self loathing.  I wish Stephanie would have done the whole series from his perspective but I guess that 's not happening. New Moon would have definitely been an interesting read. (One can only hope she surprises us with it). Until then.. ca not wait to reread this series...again.  23 book reviews: 3.5 estrellas. 24 book reviews: if i wanted to hear the inner monologue of a whiny, dramatic and self-indulgent old man i would have asked literally any men in my family thank you very much. 25 book reviews: 5/02/2021 update: as much as i would love to read about stalker boyfriends (not really), i decided to put this in the not gonna happen pile. if i really want to put myself through mental torture (the good kind), i ll reread an ember in the ashes     / / / /   *me telling myself why reading this book is a bad idea*  me: Edward is a stalker, Bella is annoying and has no individuality, I m not a twilight fangirl and this series pisses me off.  also me: *adds book to shelf*  26 book reviews: update: found this piece of bloody perfection:   (sorry to all of you who have seen this review a million times already from when the feeds froze. i could not help myself.)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  (1.5/5)  Like many things in life, my decision to read this book can be summed up in a couple of Beatles lyrics:  Sure, I started reading this book because of a buddy read (yes, we are all crazy and extremely masochistic, except for , who got dragged into this mess by the rest of us), but the decision to finish it? Entirely mine.  And, well...    To say that I regret reading this book would be the understatement of the century, only second to \"I regret reading Twilight\". Honestly, I wish my mind could process that it 's okay to dnf books . Please stick around for the funeral of my last braincell, seeing as to how all of you have already been invited.  :   Midnight Sun. The fifth book in the Twilight series. Where do I even begin reviewing this dumpster fire of a book?      I suppose it 's best to start off with how long this book is. You might be surprised to find that it 's longer than Twilight. You might even be tempted to read this book, just to see what was added. Well, let me tell you: nothing. (I actually do not know for sure because I remember exactly nothing about what happened in Twilight - they say your brain has a way of forgetting traumatic experiences sometimes - but it certainly seems that way.) This book could have been 400 pages less and still feel like a chore to read, but at least then it would not be ungodly so. Personally, I was only able to tolerate a hundred pages or so a day, and even that was painful. Basically, I am    I have to admit, based on what I remember, this book seems to be better written than Twilight was. That is not saying much, I know, but the only thing that could have made this experience worse would be reading almost 700 pages of vampire yearning and angst... written like it was fanfiction.    Apart from its unholy length, this book was incredibly irritating. For all of you out there who are thinking think again. I was thinking that since this book is from Edward 's perspective, I might actually hate this book. But alas. The entirety of this book is, in no particular order:  It 's ridiculous how much of this book is filled solely with Edward 's moody musings, constantly thinking about Bella, and how, \"boohoo, my life 's so sad,\" because he ca not be with Bella. For a hundred-some year old immortal being, Edward got caught up very quickly in all the high school drama, which is ironic, considering that it 's mentioned in the book somewhere. All of this, of course, is not to forget the number of times he thought, \"gee, I sure wish I was a human right now!\", and then proceeded to compare his skin to marble and call his fingers unnatural.    As previously stated, all Edward thinks about is Bella, but his obsession nearly makes Slendy look tame. Seriously. Everyone is always talking about how Edward watches Bella when she 's asleep and how creepy that is (I know I have), but it 's more than just that. Once he 's got her in his clutches, he refuses to let her be with anyone else. You know how he can read thoughts, but not Bella 's? Well, the only logical course of action is to the read the thoughts of those around her, and watch her all day. Definitely not creepy, right?    Honestly, this is the most wack part of the entire freaking book, which is saying a very big something. Edward acts more contrary than your average YA protagonist battling their inner demons. One second he 's swooning all over her, and the next, he 's snarling at her. There 's a lot of random randomness and unnecessary drama, made more dramatic by the fact that Bella is absolutely perfect, and worries more about Edward than her own wellness, and Edward randomly bossing Bella around.    This is carrying on from the last point, and I am pretty sure that I had an update about there being a line in the book proving my point, but this needs to be said regardless: Bella is an idiot. No matter how many times Edward tries to warn her, she refuses to listen to reason and totally attaches herself to him. No matter how many apparent red flags there are, she refuses to run. It 's incredibly frustrating to read, and makes you wonder how many girls/young women explain away harmful relationships because their only standards are this series.    Here are some more facts that need to be stated because I said so: Dammit Edward, enough with how pErFeCt and gOoDy TwO-sHoEs Bella is, we get the point!  For real. I have brown eyes and was incredibly weirded out by this.  Seriously. They are probably half the reason I managed to survive this.  I do not know if I mentioned this, but Bella x Alice seems waayyy better than Bella x Edward. At least, to me it does.  Just about every ten pages after they get together, Edward goes on a guilt-trip about what a horrible and evil monster he is, going on to compare Bella to sugar, spice, and everything nice, and how he 's going to corrupt her, etc etc. Like, seriously, no more. As if the cover did not make this obvious enough, Edward had to tell us every five seconds. This complaint, however, does not hold a candle to my biggest problem with reading this book, which was that    Thank you all for coming out today, and reading through all the garbage that precedes this.

At one point in my life, I liked Twilight then when re-reading I could not believe what I saw in those books. But despite all that, Twilight definitely brought a change to the book scene. Just think about all those authors who started by writing Twilight fan-fiction and how many Twilight fan-fiction stories were \"reskinned\" and published!  Overall, I have three things to say about this.  1) I am not really sure if I will be reading this.  2) I love pomegranate, but this one is... making my skin crawl a bit for some reason? Before I looked closely, it looked like bugs or something.  3) Should I get my hopes up again that we might see the rest of The Host books?  Anyway, I am really happy for all of you who adore Twilight that you will finally get this book! And I am really curious about how it will be received.  28 book reviews: Update 4 I give up on this book... I just CAN'T keep up with whiny sparky vampy Edward We have DIWALI here in India tomorrow!!  For those of you who do not know what Diwali is... it 's our festival where we LET GO of negative things and celebrate a new beginning And I am of this book before Diwali starts xD I just ca not celebrate it while this book is haunting my TBR!!  Its me burning this book in fireworks btw this book needs NO introduction AND MANY awesome reviews have been written anyways What I will do is express my feelings of the 20% I read through memes *Everyone on GR pretends to be shocked*  My concern is Edy killed a spider for Bella... NOW, what if that spider was Lucas the Spider??!!  Yes, guys!! this is Lucas!! Look how adorable he is!! LUCAS NEEDS JUSTICE !!  Honestly, I would rather read a book with that spider 's POV than Edy *cringes* I am not gonna write how awful this was BECAUSE sooo many other reviews have done a better job at it It 's just Edward felt like a horny emo boy IMO   I mean Bella was not just like \"other girls\" BIUT she was not like \"other humans\" too!! Also, why was EVERY guy crazy over Bella??!! I have not read twilight so I do not exactly know how Bella is BUT even from Edy 's POV she seemed borrrrring!! I am not saying I have a very \"happening \" life...Even I am a basic bitch BUT I am AWARE of it !! And tbh every other girl I know is the same !! sooo we are like each other!! NO SUCH THING AS \"NOT LIKE OTHER GURLLLLLLS\" !!!    I mean it got soooooo repetitive !! And Edys pov was not even interesting !! So I kinda get why he might like her BOTH THINK they are special snowflake LUCKILY I did not read Bella 's POV..cause I think it would have been even traumatizing Just gonna stop here cause not much to say  Kinda Buddy read with AND OFC    Lets start with a diagram...  W1=Window no.1 W2=Window no.2 BS= book shelf That weird thing in the corner=Door  Special mentions Bookshelf(duh) Kitchen..which is accessible through the door(kitchen is imp..its keeps me well fed) Mrin=Thats me saying \"Hii\" to you guys   Now before reading Midnight Sun..  Mrin NOT afraid of windows..having a peaceful sleep  After reading it.. terrified of windows You see..I have HUGE windows & I am TERRIFIED of them now Especially after reading the scene when Edward is just watching Bella *shivers*   Yo can thank me later for the drawings  BUT I HAD to explain to you guys why I am terrified of them... Please ignore the AWFUL drawing..I know its bad  I just wanted to orove my point     Starting this chaotic BR  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR MANY OF US WERE coerced into reading this book... Actual footage of dragging me into this BR    After seeing all the updates on GR about this book... Mrin be like...   Mrin who has not read the books but knows the main storyline  BUT    I have not read a book in the series BUT I do know the story.... How you ask??!! One of my closest friend is a Twilight fan... She did tell me the story & coerced me to watch some of the scenes in the movies I think I will gift her this book for her bday...  So I do know whom Bella ends up with & \"The fetus position crying scene\" BUT I am clueless about the rest of the story For the title of this book is \"The pomegranate book\"  Some of my GR friends came up with the name While I am curious to know the reaction for this book..I think I will let my other friends read this book... If they find it good..I might give this a try  P.S.: I think I am probably not making any sense  I think I will just call my friend & ask her for the summary Soooo I wo not have to read the entire series & I can still read this BOOK!!!    RN I am feeling like a multitasking pro    If you think group video call with family is easy...you have not met my family My family is quite big....so it gets confusing when everyone tries to speak at the same time  #Indianfamilyproblems  Ohh...& the deal with the Devil.... The Devil mentioned is my friend TANI ... She is trying to make me read a book...in exchange for reading my favorite series aka THE LUNAR CHRONICLES  Something tells me..I am gonna lose this deal & end up giving my soul to her (I know I am being OTT dramatic..Just bare with me )  29 book reviews: ***this is heavily influenced by the Twilight series nostalgia***  But she 's not continuing with this series anymore. (Like she ended this one with Jacob as an embryo. Literally.   Why, Meyer, why?  And she says she 's going to write 3 books in the future. Like fantasy fantasy.  Ok. But do not take it out on my ex-book boyfriend)      Do I need another thousand paged Twilight saga book?   You bet!   How do I write the review?   Edward, help me, you smirking guy.   Bella, just keep grinding your front teeth.   (I need normal ray of human thoughts.....the ray.... Let me take a day or two... I almost forgot I was done with the book two days ago. Keep up the good job  )    ***Most iconic lines:    \"Go sit down and look pale.\"  (If someone says something like this in real, I would just take out their fangs)  *\"What would I be doing if I were not the villian of this story?\"  (I should start asking this question more often)  *\"Love does not always come in convenient packages.\" \"I laughed once without humour.\"  (I did too.)      (.... checking my bookmarks)   *That \"Edmund\" moment though    (Sorry, Edward  )   . . . ***Less iconic lines:    \"Normal human girls would not raise their faces to the drizzle that way; normal human girls usually wore make-up, even here in this wet place. Bella never wore make-up, nor should she.\"  (You are just lucky, Edward. You already have tons of make-up onscreen. Sometimes I do not have to like my family of fictional characters. Calm down. He 's just make-up ignorant.)       . . .     *When the book was announced:  (I am here for the rant reviews. Got lots of tea. How long do I have to wait?)  . . .   *Just before reading the ARC:  (I miss Alice Cullen and Dr. Carlisle Cullen.  And yes, make it less painful if you plan to torture Bella and make Edward less cocky.  I got over Jacob just like a decade ago and yes, I am uncomfortable talking about my ex crushes )  . . . . . 15th August, 2020.  After a million nanoseconds,  After seriously loving all this book could provide me,  After all that a decade year old nostalgia,  This mortal ended up loving this book so much.   Stephanie Meyer, you served your revenge. My tea got burnt    . . . .  Yes, I believe my rating and whatever I write here for the review is heavily influenced by a decade year old nostalgia and the almost (my-brain-cannot-delete-movie) adaptations.  But I do really appreciate how this one turned out the be so much better written. (I would not have reread the series even though I was obsessed with it for years if it was not for this one)   ***Cynical me before:  Why is the author writing the same stuff again?! That too after a decade! Why??!   ***Hopeless Twilight munchkin now:  Give me anything Twilight. I am here to show you to the world like the King in Lion King showed the prince cub to the entire heaven world, earth world and the dark world.  (Told me to take two days' time and not to write anything just after reading the book but no.  Actual human like review will be up later on when the effects wear off a bit.)  I think I am getting old    ***The character which was really not required?  Mike. Does anyone even remember him?      *I feel book betrayed   *I have been wanting to rant about this    *See now what just happened   I say do not trust book addicts      *I do not know who to trust anymore     We are all dramabaes. Born to be. Meant to be     Know what mattered in the end?  I stan harder for Alice Cullen.  And I love Carlisle Cullen like crazy still.  Yes, some things will not change.   ....and oh damn, Jacob just entered the drama    When is the next book coming, eh?    Jacob, my other (ex) bae, sounds so much like another side character in this one. Not fair. I say, not fair.   The book ended just...like that    The ten year older me than in 2009 is not very happy at the moment but loved the version of this book anyway.  This series saved me from everything unpleasant when I was away from home for the first time in my life.     I owe you a lot, Stephanie Meyer    ",
    " Modern Comfort Food: A Barefoot Contessa Cookbook": "book reviews: WELCOME TO MAY PROJECT!!! this is part ONE. PART TWO can be found HERE.  i wo not be doing one-a-day, but i am going to do A LOT, so get on board now! MODERN! COMFORT! FOOD!  OUTRAGEOUS GARLIC BREAD    since this is the internet, i figured this project should with outrage. outrage and considerably more cheese than the recipe specified. extra cheese is MY comfort food, ina!      i agree that tuna melts are comfort food. i do NOT agree that the tuna used to a tuna melt should cost $11 a jar. or come in a jar at all. but i recognize that ina garten enjoys a much higher level of comfort across the board than broke-ass me, and for her, spending $22 on just the tuna part of a couple of sandwiches ai not no thing. next time i make these, it will be with canned tuna, on sale.  for the cheeseporners: look at that ooze.    also, i went to a couple of different places for microgreens, and no one had any, so i just chopped some arugula and called it a day. i am not looking to get covid scouring all of nyfc just for some microgreens. ina garten probably has hers hand-delivered by a microgreen farmer, but that 's an unchecked item on my bucket list.    burgers are DEFINITELY comfort food. this recipe is less about the what-goes-into-them and more about the technique, which involves briefly FREEZING the patties before slapping them on the skillet!    it soon becomes this    which deserves a closer look    and in case you are wondering, that middle is how i like my meat cooked.    comfort me with burgers, anytime.    HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO! how 's that for some cheese?    again, ina garten takes a comfy trashpanda treat like nachos and hoists it up to her classier-than-you level and it 's heckin' delicious, but it 's certainly not going to replace the original. i hate to keep being a gauche person harping on $$, but shoooot this crab was thirty dang dollars! i am not that fancy, tho i AM fancy enough to own a nachosaurus    if i go broke doing this project, at least i will die chubby.      i have officially found my forever sauce    it is so simple to make, but so flavorful. it has are you sitting down? 3 bulbs of garlic in it. not cloves BULBS. and there 's fennel seeds and red pepper flakes and chianti and basil and it all comes together beautifully and harmoniously and it is the One for Me.    arrabbiata means \"angry\" in italian, but i will never get in a fight with this sauce.     time for a sweet treat! this is another keeper it might not look like much, but it is intense! frozen strawberries, fresh raspberries, milk, greek yogurt, vanilla ice cream; all standard milkshake stuff, but then she has the audacity to add JAM! why have i never put JAM into a milkshake before?? i meddled with the proportions a bit, because i like my milkshakes to require a spoon, and this puppy was thick and sweet and definitely gave me comfort. oh, and there 's chambord in it, too, because we are adults. adults who drink jam.  ARE YOU READY FOR A COMPLETE MEAL??            pause for cheese        all delicious, but special awe reserved for that broccolini, which, while conceptually simple and quick to make, nonetheless left me a changed woman. damn good potatoes, too, emily! and i would be more trumpet-y about the fish if i had not grown up a new england lass with my heart already full of my dad 's cooking. my dad 's fish is BOMB. this one 's pretty good, but i am spoken for in the seafood-recipe department.        just a light snack because i still have some leftovers. these are tasty, but i am not crazy about the hollandaise sauce, despite claims of quickness. and as a TMI-aside, my relationship with shishito peppers has never been one of 'comfort.' i love them, but they do things to me which are quite uncomfortable, indeed. DISCREET HINT: IT'S IN THE NAME OF THE PEPPERS AND IT'S POOP. MY BODY IS A QUICK-PROCESSING PLANT FOR SHISHITO PEPPERS.    the CDC has declared that the best way to recover from that dreaded second shot is to eat LOBSTER. so i did.    it may not be the 'comfort food' i grew up on, but this sauceporn sure is helping me feel safe from covid.      ina garten, you win. sometimes it IS worth it to shell out for fancy ingredients like ground lamb. there are no words for how delicious this is, so i will let the pictures speak for themselves.      i never want to eat anything else.    i did not post anything last night, because i was too busy enjoying some hot alcohol after a long day    i wanted to make these before summer started doing its thing and it got too hot to enjoy the autumnal pleasures of cider and bourbon and hoo boy, this is one i will make when those leaves start turning again. i doubled up the amount of peppercorns and cinnamon and poured the bourbon with a heavy hand it was 1000% the right decision.      look at this beautiful thing i made perfectly!    DON'T look under the hood to see that my potato galette is a potato goofus that i guess i did not desiccate enough before attempting to galette so it 's just a loose bunch of potato kindling instead of a pancake and that 's okay.    everything looks better once you toss some smoked fish on top of it. it is nature 's beautifying blanket.        these just look like regular cookies, right?  WRONGO! they are HUGE!    some of mine wanted to make friends. oops.    but with sneaky cropping, no one will know!    this is my evening. what are you doing?        some of these sprouts look like they have been carbon-ized rather than carbonara would, but that 's what you WANT sprouts are SO GOOD when they are nice and crispy round the edges.    not my best photography, but as far as tastiness goes, ina and i both get high marks.  fun fact: the lighting is best in my bathroom    so now there are probably fecal particles all over my 'za and this is why i will never become a famous chef.      because i do not live inside an applebee s, i do not have a panini press, so i just plopped these bad boys onto my cast iron skillet and hoped for the best. my chutney was mango , so it had a nice little kick to it. i have made hundreds of grilled cheeses in my life i made fifty in a row for an earlier food project, and this one falls somewhere in the middle of Best Grilled Cheeses Ever. do try it, but don t write home about it.      i got to make my favorite sauce again!! and then i got to smoosh it all up with cheese and squash and yummmmmm    not to toot my own horn or nothing, but these things look    add some wine, and you got a balanced meal, and i daresay some COMFORT!      this cookbook project sure is helping me keep my neighborhood liquor store in business! this was the perfect drink for this NINETY-ONE DEGREE evening. that is too hot for may. or ever. anywhere.  it 's a beautiful drink, though. very delicate colors. here it is in natural light:    in light-bulb light:    and half in my tummy:    nothing like drinking a fishbowl fulla tequila and grapefruit juice after an honest day 's work...    you guys, i made a cake. it is the best cake i have ever made.    LOOK! AT! THIS! CAKE!!!     and just to gild this dam lily    that shark 's making eyes at my cake...NONE FOR YOU, SHARK!    no more words. my mouth needs room for cake.      here 's a quick little side dish because it 's too hot to cook a full meal    although this one is satisfying enough to eat a meal, and it 's got three whole food groups, if you count the bread crumbs. cheese should really be its own group, if you ask me    i certainly have a type  another twofer:    do you like my new dollar-store platter? SUCH RUSTIC OLDE TIMINESS!  i was not going to make anything from the breakfast chapter because it all seemed basic/boring, but rebecca popped onto this thread praising these eggs so i figured i would give 'em a shot. and despite my not loving dill, they were very good!    the photos are not great because soft-boiled eggs are time-sensitive models, congealing quickly and unprettily, but WE DO OUR BEST!    the hash browns were sort of a rerun; a couple years back i reviewed (review and ) which included a version of these. i misunderstood ina 's directions, and put the batter(?) into the waffle iron the way mr. shumski taught me, so instead of making 8 tiny hash browns, i made three humungos. BUT, learning from my galette-fail, i squeezed every last drop of moisture outta these taters, and they held together nicely.    in conclusion: breakfast! for! dinner!      bring on the CHEESE!    unsurprisingly, mac and cheese is my ultimate comfort food, any way/shape/form. this one 's a decadent oozy masterpiece of flavors with a satisfying density that will stick to your ribs for DAYS.    it 's far more involved than the trump-orange boxed variety, and you will have to wash this many dishes afterwards, when you are far too logy with pasta and cheese to even    it 's worth the effort, and if you worked with me, you would get one of these tupperwares so you could enjoy it without having to dirty even a single pot.    as a bonus feature, i have invented a new game called \"what kind of roadkill does this most resemble?\"        oops, i made it again.      ina 's recipe calls for coffee-chip ice cream (to be precise, it 's talenti coffee chocolate chip, which is a GELATO, so this recipe name is a LIE) and heath bar baking bits. i already had the second half of a bag of heath bar baking bits in my cupboard, and have been wondering 'what do i do with this half-bag of heath bar baking bits?' for years. this solution to my heath bar quandary was the deciding factor in choosing to make these, despite not being crazy about coffee-in-dessert-form.  sadly, i discovered this recipe too late. i have no idea how long that half-bag of heath bar baking bits has been in my cupboard, but the short answer is \"too long,\" and they were GROSS. to get the horrible taste out of my mouth, i bought a couple of skor bars and chopped them up to use instead. then i bought some double chocolate chip talenti gelato and pretzels and made some superior frozen treats.    there 's not enough room left here, so wo not you please follow me over to another edition of the book so 's we can wrap this up in style?   1 book reviews: WELCOME TO MAY PROJECT!!! this is part TWO. PART ONE can be found HERE.  SHRIMP & LINGUINE FRA DIAVOLO  i got to make my beloved arrabbiata sauce for a third time!    but then i had to make a whole other recipe on top of that. somewhat labor intensive, but well worth it.    but who 's this?    oh no, shrimpy! laying down his (delicious) body to save his friends! but it 's too late, little shrimpy, you are the sole survivor of the arrabbiata assault. this project just got pretty dark and i am sorry. looks like MAY is actually the cruelest month after all.    but back to the food-review: the crispety cruncheties are the real stars here. they are just butter-fried panko with some seasonings, but they bring a lot of YUM.  only ONE DAY LEFT, but i still want to make so many more things.      okay, this one won the final slot because 1) CHEESE, and 2) \"raclette\" rhymes with my last name.    this was very tasty, and CHEESY and i got to make little cornichon fans (which i just realized you ca not see in the pictures so hang on) HERE:    anyway, thanks for following along. i have enjoyed this project very much and i will update in this secondary review space as i make more dishes in the futuuure, although some of them are more suited to cold-weathertimes, so it might be a while. HOLD TIGHT!        these are the ones i had planned to make during this project, but there just were not enough days in the month:  KIELBASA WITH MUSTARD DIP CHICKEN POT PIE SOUP WITH PUFF PASTRY CROUTONS BAKED FISH CHOWDER MAINE LOBSTER STEW SEARED TUNA AND AVOCADO ROLLS SKILLET-ROASTED CHICKEN & POTATOES FRESH CRAB & PEA RISOTTO  additional pictures (including pics of each of her finished dishes) are over on blog  THE PROJECT CONTINUES with  HERS:    at the critical meringue-ing stage, where you were meant to \"whisk on high for 10 minutes,\" my mixer died. i tried to be a mixer, i really did, but my flabby little arms could not replicate the whisking power of a machine. i googled \"how do the amish make meringue\" and the answer is: using air compressors to power their hand mixers.  anyway, these did not come out the way they were supposed to, but they were still very tasty and i will make them again once i replace my mixer and some time has passed to salve my emotional wounds.      fed up with everything, instead of making individual cookies for the second batch, i just glopped the remainder onto a baking sheet and there you have it      weird, slightly overcooked meringue. i have since replaced my mixer, so all is well.      i do not think i have ever had apple butter before. i thought it was some kind of paste or something, and maybe it is and that 's why she specifies that this is CHUNKY apple butter, like how chunky peanut butter is its own anomalous thing. anyway, this is basically applesauce that takes longer to make and requires a vanilla bean and now i am out of vanilla beans. when i make applesauce i do not use any sugar at all, so this one was maybe too sweet for me (says the girl who eats marshmallow fluff with a spoon). but it 's got good fall spices like cloves and allspice and is maybe best in the fall, because midsummer is not really a buyer 's market for the cider called for in the recipe, so, betrayed by the farmer 's market, i had to settle for the ONE overpriced option at the store and it was not thick and cloudy the way cider ought to be.      apparently, in my neighborhood, one can buy boneless chicken breasts without skin, or bony chicken breasts skin, but NOT boneless chicken breasts WITH skin. considering that the draw of this recipe is the crispy skin, i chose the bony breasts, so i was unable to slice them all nice like she commanded,    but they were still great: moist and juicy and crispy, with a lovely glisteny brown butter sauce which makes it look somewhat smeary and greasy-looking here, but that 's because i am bad at food photography.  i did not use any dill in my orzo because i am not a fan (and i used extra feta because i AM a fan), so it 's not the prettiest orzo in photographic history, but it was a fine companion to the chicken and it was VERY lemony.    i made the again, and they came out even better.      although it did sortof give me some flashbacks      TONIGHT I AM MAKING A POSSET! WTF IS THAT EVEN?    SO! although it sounds like something a courtesan wears, a posset is actually some kind of a semi-jiggly pudding, in this case, a lemon-flavored one covered in macerated straw- and raspberries. it is deliciously sharp and sour, but the berries offset the pucker perfectly.    NB: it becomes significantly less jiggly the longer it takes you to get a decent picture of it in this unbearable summer heat    until it melts into something resembling the way i feel inside and out.    this recipe calls for limoncello liqueur, which is apparently only sold in one-liter bottles. so now i have a whole bottle (less 4 tablespoons) of limoncello and no idea what to do with the rest of it. suggestions welcome.    and where was i when we all learned that snoop had a freaking ros  line?    i have not cracked it open yet, but that time is drawing nigh.  served with  a tray of delicious sausages!    a close-up of delicious sausages!    and a puddle of polenta (her words, my reality):    this polenta looks like the early-morning sidewalk in front of the bars in my neighborhood, but it was absolutely delicious, even spooned cold into my mouth the next day. she does indeed use the word \"puddle\" in the recipe to describe the polenta, but hers looks nothing like the puddle my direction-following-self produced.    but that 's fine i am not trying to be pretty over here, and it gorgeous. it 's also fun to knife-skim corn from its cob, which i have never done before but is oddly therapeutic.  here is their blessed union:    with a hearty plop of basil and cheese    this concludes my sausage party. more recipes coming, probably...   2 book reviews: Just posted my Goodreads Choice 2020 Reaction Video on Booktube! Click the link to check it out!! The Written Review The premise of this cookbook is that right now, what we need most, is modern comfort food.  The past year has not been a good one and we might be needing some of that childhood deliciousness.  We are craving that of our childhood but we also kinda want to make a bit more sophisticated than  So, Ina Garten has taken 85 recipes that are deeply rooted in comfort foods and has given them her own spin.  If you are - you can try fresh crab nachos, spicy pimento cheese spread or fig & cheese toasts.  If - you can try chicken pot pie soup, ultimate tuna melts and lobster BLT 's.  Overall, I really liked this one. The variety of the recipes is what really appealed to me.  There were (i.e. swapping tomato soup and grilled cheese for creamy tomato bisque and cheddar & chutney grilled cheese).  And there were ones that like baked rigatoni with lamb ragu.  There 's recipes for gatherings and ones for a fancy dinner with the spouse or a fabulous brunch with the in-laws.      | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  3 book reviews: I read a Goodreads award winner! And actually agreed with the choice for once. I had been on the waitlist at the library for this little sucker forever and a day and I finally got it. I mean Barefoot Contessa and Comfort Foods?   During the worst year ever?   I LOVE this cookbook. I screen shot the heck outta it but I am going to be honest. I want a copy of this one. My tastes changes randomly and I know I will be mad if I do not have every single recipe in my hungry little hands. I did go ahead and make the Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Chipolte Orange Butter...and OMG those suckers were delish. I ate the last two cold out of the fridge.   4 book reviews: Perfect pandemic reading for those of us living a quarantine life, especially when married to a man who had no interest in going out even during before times. Recipes for all mealtimes and desserts. Already tried a few with one satisfied grunt from the loner. 5 book reviews: The Goodreads 2020 Cookbook of the Year  In a word: Unremarkable. I understand that this cookbook was supposed to be a step back, an exploration of classic comfort foods - but that does not explain the overall lack of flavor. In general, these recipes are good, but underwhelming and at times a tad bit boring. Both in terms of recipes and techniques, there 's very little here that you have not seen before and very little that I would consider the best of its kind. Unfortunately, that leads me to the conclusion that this cookbook is not worth buying - you know how to cook the majority of these recipes already and you most likely wo not miss the rest.  Exception 1: If you are not putting mango chutney on your grilled cheese sandwiches yet, do it - we will never make grilled cheese the same way again. The tomato soup recipes is also a great, home-made version of Campbell 's Creamy IMO.  Exception 2: The Arrabbiata Sauce is exceptional; a staple red sauce for any and all uses. Highly recommend.   Pet Peeves: 1. Ina has a tendency to recommend \"high value\" ingredients that are supposedly significantly better than their cheaper alternatives. See expensive pomegranate juice, a specific brand of fig spread or bottle of wine, and a $20 jar tuna.  She also has a tendency to introduce high end ingredients where they are absolutely not necessary. See Lobster BLT 's (the lobster was a bland detractor vs. a flavorful component), Truffled Mac and Cheese (this one may be personal as I do not like truffles), and Lobster Bisque ($100 soup).  Overall, the result is a cookbook full of recipes that may need to be adapted or paired down for the average American household - not a winner in terms of accessibility. Couple that with the general lack of 'wow-factor' taste and I am left asking \"Why?\"  2. Friends w/Rob Marshall, film director; John DeLuca, actor; Miguel Flores-Vianna, photographer; Eli Zabar, restaurateur; Emily Blunt, actress; Rolando Beramendi, chef ...  Just to name a few. Not to mention the remarkable number of global restaurants mentioned. Okay Ina, we get it: You know a lot of fancy people and dine at a lot of fancy places. #unrelatable  3. What happens when a very old-school, White-American cook is asked to produce Mexican recipes? You get incredibly White-American \"Mexican\" food.  There are 1) Chicken Enchiladas with French goat cheese vs. cotija, queso fresco or oaxaca; 2) Breakfast Tacos, scrambled eggs with Montery Jack and avocado that happen to be served in tortillas; and 3) Steak Fajitas with no chile - Old El Paso could probably do it better.   9/12 Recipes Completed Ultimate Bloody Marys (1/5) Frozen Palomas (4/5) Pomegranate Gimlets (4/5) Warm Spinach & Artichoke Dip (3/5) Fresh Crab Nachos (3/5) Cacio e Pepe Cheese Puffs (3/5) Grilled Oysters with Lemon Dill Butter (2/5) Spicy Pimento Cheese Spread (3/5) Kielbasa w Mustard Dip (3/5)  11/14 Recipes Chicken Pot Pie Soup (4/5) Split Pea Soup w/Crispy Kielbasa (2/5) Maine Lobster Stew (3/5) Seared Tuna & Avocado Rolls (1/5) Ultimate Tuna Melts (4/5) Lobster BLTs (3/5) Creamy Tomato Bisque (4/5) Cheddar and Chutney Grilled Cheese (5/5) Baked Raclette (2/5) Broccoli and Kale Salad (2/5) Tomato and Goat Cheese Crostata (3/5)  15/18 Recipes Tuscan Turkey Roulade (3/5) Skillet Roasted Chicken and Potatoes (3/5) Crispy Chicken with Lemon Orzo (3/5) Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas (3/5) Smashed Hamburgers w/Carnalized Onions (3/5) Steak Fajitas (3/5) Roasted Sausages, Peppers and Onions (4/5) Seared Salmon with Spicy Red Pepper Aioli (3/5) Baked Cod w/Garlic and Herb Ritz Crumbs (3/5) Brussels Sprouts Pizza Carbonara (3/5) Shrimp and Linguine Fra Diavolo (3/5) Baked Rigatoni w/Lamb Ragu (3/5) Spring Green Spaghetti Carbonara (4/5) Truffled Mac and Cheese (3/5) Spaghetti Squash Arrabbiata (4/5)  9/15 Recipes Roasted Broccolini and Cheddar (3/5) Roasted Cauliflower w/Lemon and Capers (3/5) Charred Carrots (2/5) Cheddar and Scallion Creamed Corn (4/5) Roasted Shishito Peppers w/Easy Hollandaise (2/5) Fresh Corn Polenta (3/5) Pur ed Potatoes w/Lemon (3/5) Outrageous Garlic Bread (3/5) Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Chipotle Orange Butter (2/5)  1/15 Recipes Black and White Cookies (2/5)   5 Stars: Amazing, Loved 4 Stars: Really Good, Will Make Again 3 Stars: Good, Average 2 Stars: Did not Like 1 Star: Hated  6 book reviews: Twelve cookbooks in, Ina Garten 's recipes still have that wow factor. To wit, I have bookmarked more than half the book with Post-Its for future culinary adventures.  With what could not be a more timely release for the season we are in (it 's the first book I have read that references the pandemic), Ina is serving up exactly what we all need   comfort food.  Of course, this is not any ol' comfort food. My Mom may have made pot roast regularly, but never with red wine and cognac. We had our fair share of nachos on Game Day, too, but none were topped with jumbo lump crab. This book is exactly what we would expect for Ina and yet it holds a few surprises. I never expected a chicken enchilada recipe from her (but oh how I ca not wait to try them). Ditto for garlic bread, vanilla cold brew coffee, or a new take on a classic tomato bisque.  Whether you are a beginner or someone who whips up multiple meals a day, Ina 's helpful tips are the difference between a decent result and something that 's sublime. And despite decades of experience, it was fun hearing that she 's been struggling to perfect a recipe that 's been in process for years   Boston Cream Pie. If it took her this long to sign off on it, you know it 's going to be good. Those personal stories, not to mention a wide array of cuisine with influences from all around the world, are what make Modern Comfort Food such a delight.  Note: I have received a free copy from Clarkson Potter in exchange for a free and unbiased review.  7 book reviews: Gorgeous book! The recipes are great and they all sound delicious. I checked the ingredients list and cooking directions. Ingredients are easy to find and the cooking direction is very easy to follow. I don t think you can go wrong with this. It s all about comfort food, right? Perfect for while staying at home because of the current pandemic. I have selected a few recipes to try this weekend.  8 book reviews: Nice photos, but I do not know if having the book was better than online recipes unless you want to cook through the whole book. Many recipes sound good, like the lemon orzo recipe, but have a lot of steps. 9 book reviews: What 's not to love about Ina Garten 's yummy cook book for this difficult year. 2020 is the perfect time to treat yourself to comfort food and Ina 's just the best friend cook we need to guide us through. Wonderful recipes, great photography. Instant classic. 10 book reviews: Comfort food - what a delightful thought! Ina Garten s Modern Comfort Food Cookbook arrives on the scene at the end of a very difficult year. The author acknowledges this pandemic  year in her introduction, and she wants to give people comfort food with a modern twist to help everyone deal with all that goes with staying at home and not visiting friends or having a party during this holiday season. She hopes people will read her book and make healthier comfort food instead of reaching for a pint of Ben & Jerry s Cookie Dough Iac Cream. Actually, she states Haagen Daz in her book, but I mentioned B & J s Cookie Dough ice Cream because it is a favorite of mine! The author presents recipes the she hopes will be  not just nourishing but it s also emotionally satisfying.  I will admit that I wish to try some of her recipes such as Chicken Pot Pie Soup, Creamy Tomato Bisque, Baked Raclette (a  decadent potato, sausage, and cheese dish  flavored by Swiss, French, and Spanish foods.), Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas, Emily s English Roasted Potatoes, Smashed Hamburgers with Caramelized Onions, and, most definitely, Apple Cinnamon, Dutch Baby which I know as German Pancakes which are truly a feast for your tastebuds. This author has given us a different way to weather this pandemic! Thank you, Ms. Garten! 4.25 stars.  11 book reviews: Recent purchase. Some good recipes-have tried two so far (stew and pan roasted chicken and potatoes). Delicious and easy to make. Off to a good start. 12 book reviews: Love this woman!! So good. I think I will roll out of the house when Covid 19 is done. 13 book reviews: She can do no wrong in my eyes, this is pure comfort food. 14 book reviews: Love Ina 's warm writing and delicious recipes. This book was a comfort in this awful year. 15 book reviews: Someone please let Ina out of her multi book deal. A two page spread on sauteed rainbow chard? 16 book reviews: Ina is the master of easy and approachable cooking. 17 book reviews: Love her! Own all 12 cookbooks! Her Boston cream pie and her lamb ragu is to die for, I fucking love Ina! 18 book reviews: Joni says: The Contessa strikes again! Leave it to Ms. Garten to give us what we need at just the right time   a new cookbook filled with recipes that have a modern take on comfort foods. What exactly is comfort food? The Barefoot Contessa says that  it s food that s not just nourishing but it s also emotionally satisfying.  In other words, it really hits the spot! What Ms. Garten does is take a classic comfort food and bump it up a notch with a little twist of flavor that makes the dish even that much better. I ve had this book checked out for just 3 weeks and have already made 12 of the recipes. Each and every one of them has turned out perfect and so delicious. My family and I have loved the Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas, Skillet-roasted Chicken & Potatoes, Baked Rigatoni with Lamb Ragu, Fresh Corn Polenta, Chocolate-dipped Brown Sugar Shortbread, and Bittersweet Chocolate Cake.  As with all of her cookbooks (12 of them now), this one has a gorgeous photo to accompany each well-written recipe. Additionally, a recipe index that is organized by meal is included; I find that extremely helpful as it s often easier to peruse the list of lunch or desserts to find what you want. I think this is probably one of my favorite cookbooks of hers. I like it so much that I m actually going to buy it; I know I ll be reaching for this book quite often.  19 book reviews: For a book that was published during Covid, I was expecting recipes with accessible and cost-effective ingredients. It 's best to assume that this cookbook will do better in a post-Covid world, one where entertaining friends and family does not put you at considerable risk.  I appreciated how creative the recipes were. I mean chicken pot pie soup?! It ca not get any better than that. That being said, many of the recipes not only use alcohol, but require it. Unfortunate for anyone such as myself who does not drink.  I tried the raspberry corn muffins and they were not very good. They were tart and salty at the same time - not the best combo. I am on the other hand really excited to make the Boston cream pie, which is actually more of a cake. This recipe in particular took six years for Garten to master and incorporates orange, which I am sure pairs wonderfully with the chocolate. I will update when I have made the cake.  Links:   20 book reviews: Ina Garten, one of my favorite TV cooks, offers this new recipe collection. Grouped into cocktails, lunch, dinner, vegetables & sides, dessert, and breakfast, featured menu items include cider and alcoholic beverages, appetizers, soups, salads, pasta dishes, seafood, vegetable \"casseroles\" such as ones you would find at a church potluck, cookies, cakes, Boston cream pie, cereals, muffins, hash browns, and even iced coffee. Everyone will find something of interest. I have made dishes similar to some of these, but I am certain to try a few of these in the new year. I may deviate from her recipes when they call for something like mustard or mushrooms, ingredients I can eat but do not really like well enough to want to add in a dish. (Besides I am allergic to funguses, so avoiding mushrooms is something I should do.) Those things are easy enough to leave out, and sometimes an ingredient substitution can be made. I love Ina 's cookbooks, and this one combines great photography with usable recipes.  21 book reviews: I received Ina 's new cookbook as a Good Reads give-away!!!!!!!  I read cookbooks like I read fiction - cover to cover. Each recipe is like a new chapter. Every part of the day is represented with new recipes to try. With the title of Modern comfort Food you can try recipes that are not necessarily new but always with a touch of Ina elegance like her own special steak frajitas, smashed hamburgers with carmelized onions or skillet roasted chicken and potatoes. Each has its own special ingredients that make it very typically Ina Garten. There are more than several recipes that I am going to try. Of course, her tips and narratives are written directly to the reader. The pictures, as always in her cookbooks, are gorgeous 8 X 10 glossies that totally enhance the book.  This cookbook will be a continuous big hit for me!  22 book reviews: Ina does it again! I don t know how she managed to make a book that not only has beautiful pictures, her warm and comforting words (so needed right now), and recipes that all as in every one! sound delicious and straightforward. Yet she has. Thank you, Ina, for giving us just what we needed at the right time. 23 book reviews: Every dish is a good one. She 's the GOAT as far as I am concerned. 24 book reviews: I used to watch Ina on cable and she was such a joy to watch. She had this calmness about her and the way that she moved through the kitchen, putting her recipes together, it all seemed so easy. I have tried a few of her recipes and they have been great, so I thought I would love this cookbook. I also love cookbooks. I have quite a few cookbooks (my husband thinks I have too many) and I also subscribe to some cooking magazines, but I like to read and try different things (within reason). When I saw \"Modern Comfort\", I thought who does not love comfort food? You know how some people definitions are different? I think this is one of them.  I love many things about this cookbook but the recipes themselves, they just do not do much for me. I will get to that in a minute but let 's talk about what 's great about this cookbook. The cookbook is very attractive and pleasing to look at. It 's definitely a heavy one too, with 256 pages. I liked the smooth, glossy pages and the page count includes the two recipe indexes yes, I said two! She has included one A - Z index and one index that breaks the dishes into their specific categories. These categories include breakfast, lunch, dinner, cocktails, vegetables & sides, and desserts. The author also made a reference to these categories at the bottom of each page, down by the page number, so you know where you re at when you re looking inside the cookbook. I like these little extra touches. Each recipe gets a 2-page spread with the recipe on one side and a picture on the other. Detailed, step-by-step directions are easy to follow and each recipe includes a small paragraph about the recipe too. The recipe includes how many it will serve but not the individual serving size. It might say, \"Serves 6\" but it does not say how big each serving size is.  The book itself is set up by categories, the ones I mentioned earlier. The first section is Cocktails. Listed on one page, it has all the recipes for that section. I thought it would have been nice, had she also listed the page number for each cocktail on this page. I know that the recipes go in sequence according to this list, and I know that I can go back to the indexes but having it here would be helpful.  I found there were only about 5-6 dishes inside this cookbook that I found comforting. When I was thinking  comforting , I was thinking pasta, meat, potatoes, salads, soup and  modern  to me meant, making these foods healthy and/or easier to prepare. This is where I was confused. I found inside this cookbook Brussels Sprouts Pizza Carbonara, Roasted Shishito Peppers with Easy Hollandaise, Maine Lobster Stew, English Lemon Posset, and Pomegranate Gimlets. These didn t sound comforting to me. These seemed rather fancy to my everyday life. It s a beauty of a cookbook but it s just not one that would get much use at my house. 3.5 rounding up to 4 stars  25 book reviews: It 's not secret that I love comfort food and there are some really great recipes in this collection. From fig and cheese toasts to spicy pimento cheese spread to smashed eggs on toast, I found a lot of things I want to try. I bet you will, too. 26 book reviews: My first Ina cookbook. She 's not particularly one of my favorite chef 's so I have never really paid much attention to her cookbooks or show, but I can say that I was pleasantly impressed with this one! I borrowed it from the library, but I think I might need my own copy. 27 book reviews: You cannot go wrong with an Ina recipe. 28 book reviews:   I think I could handle making the croutons and the breakfast tacos. That s it 29 book reviews: Ina is the absolute best!  ",

RIP, Betty White. *Reviewed by Darla from Red Bridge*  2 book reviews: Yesterday I walked past a little bookstore that displayed this book in the window. Little did I know that she would pass away the very next day. She was one of the good ones, smart, funny, and kind. All highlighted in the book as well as her award winning career. Betty White will definitely be missed. On the last page,  Betty loves to make the world happy. No wonder people and animals everywhere love her right back!  3 book reviews:  Butterflies are like women   we may look pretty and delicate, but baby, we can fly through a hurricane.   I grew up with Betty White in my life. Remember seeing her in sitcoms, game shows, and being interviewed by late night talk show hosts. She was always so gracious and loving while talking to others and knew how to make everyone laugh and feel great about themselves. She ll be missed dearly.  This was a great look at the life of a legend. She has done so much good in her life and it s great to showcase all of that. A wonderful book for fans of our Golden Girl.  4 book reviews: I have loved Betty White since I was a kid along with The Golden Girls and am heartbroken about her passing.

It would be a great picture book for kids interested in learning more about such a fabulous, iconic woman. 9 book reviews: This is a nice little children and adult friendly biography of Betty White. Her activism and love for animals is highlighted. 10 book reviews: I purchased My Little Golden Book about Betty White right before the iconic actress' passing. This is a remarkably complete biography of a legend. It details Betty 's days growing up in California, how she volunteered to drive a truck with supplies for soldiers during WWII and her early days in radio and television. It mentions how she was the host of a variety show. TV stations in various parts of the country wanted Arthur Dunkin, the black dancer on the show, fired. Betty would not allow it. The dancer remained on the show. Mr. Dunkin and Betty would become lifelong friends. There is a section in My Little Golden Book describing Betty 's love for games, meeting and eventually marrying Allen Lunden. It continues with more of her career including working on The Golden Girls and as host for SNL. Ofcourse the book talks about Betty 's love of nature, animals and her meeting with Koko the gorilla who named Betty, Lipstick. The illustrations are lively and engaging. I hear this is a hard title to acquire now. But if you can get a copy, buy one. Or two. My Little Golden Book about Betty White is one of the best Little Golden Books I have ever read.  11 book reviews: Adorable kids book. My 7yo found the biography to be fascinating (Betty White as the subject, this was inevitable) and the artwork of the animals to be sweet. A cute book for adult fans of White to read to the next generation. 12 book reviews: Cute book about the life of Betty White! I love her so much and hate that she 's gone, but she definitely lived a great life. 13 book reviews: Simply adorable. The art in this book is beautiful, too.

I love her and her legacy. 15 book reviews: This is the most amazing thing ever!

Here is to your celebration of life!  18 book reviews: I grew up on Little Golden Books. When I saw they were creating an RBG posthumously, I bought several as gifts and kept one for my own shelf.  Betty White is no less a legend in her own right. She was an amazing woman; I will be delighted one day to share and read her story to little people in my life. 19 book reviews: I just loved this tribute book to Betty White.

It was a nice reminder of the life she lived and the passion that she shared with the world. 23 book reviews: Sometimes in life, you need wholesome things in your life that will make you smile. I know this is a kid s and that I m forty-six years old, but what s more wholesome than a kid s book about Betty White?! I remember reading Little Golden Books when I was a kid and I like that they are doing biographies now especially biographies that introduce kids to entertainment icons like Betty White. This book made me smile and now I m gonna read the Little Golden Book biography about Dolly Parton.  24 book reviews:   25 book reviews: \"I think everybody needs a passion. Whether it 's one passion or a hundred, that 's what keeps life interesting.\"  Betty White  I never knew that Betty White volunteered to drive a supply truck in California during World War II.

The stickers are sturdy and easy to remove from the sticker sheet. The colors are vibrant and it 's simple to follow the instructions to find the right placement for each sticker.

    " Prayer Journal for Women: 52 Week Scripture, Devotional & Guided Prayer Journal": "book reviews: There are plain journals and there are guided prayer journals. This is the latter. I have used both and they both have their place. While in a way it might seem strange to list it as 'currently-reading' when I am writing in it as much as reading it, the reading in this case guides the writing. Also, this one is VEEEEEERY structured, to be done over 52 weeks, so it may not be my primary journal, but one I do on the side to learn Scripture. It was a gift from one of my Carmelite sisters for my Definitive Promise that I saved until I finished my previous journal.  It was wonderful to learn so many new Scripture verses, or maybe it would more correct to say, made them my own, as most were already at least somewhat familiar. I have decided that I am going to use Scripture from now on to inspire my journaling.  1 book reviews: Yes and No. The actual journaling portion is small and I feel the devotion does not follow the questions very well. \"For Women\" is mentioned in the title but I did not feel it targeted women at all. I gave up writing in this book after a few weeks. 2 book reviews: Wow what a year with this journal! I am typically ready terrible at doing daily or weekly devotions, but I wanted to find something that demanded my time and forced me to sit and dwell with God s Word. The fact that each week is a coloring page, a devotional, and a journal/check-in, I cannot recommend this enough! I loved going back and looking at each week with what I was praying for, what I asked God to teach me, and some of the highlights! If you re looking for something to work on through this next year, this is for you!  3 book reviews: Expected new things to write about each day, but it was the same format and felt I was repeating myself. The reflection question to start the week was often vague or not applicable to me or my life. Having said that I am glad I have a diary of sorts for 2023. 4 book reviews: Enjoying the ongoing journey with the journal 5 book reviews: Great guided journal for those who need a little direction. Beautiful artwork. Well laid out, would highly recommend. 6 book reviews: Amazing prayer journal and devotional. So thankful for it especially during the pandemic.   7 book reviews: This is a great way to keep track of the people you want to pray for and exactly what their prayer request is. 8 book reviews: 5/5 stars  This journal is a great way to get to GOD!! 9 book reviews: Great for reflection! 10 book reviews: Not a  journaler  and loving this!

    " Rage": "book reviews: Sabaa Tahir deserves the world and nothing less for birthing this book. this book took me through all the emotions and i don t regret it one bit.  sabaa puts into words the way i think and feel. the way that grief, failure, love, struggle, and forgiveness is written in this book made me ACHE!! my heart was pounding and my eyes were puffy and red.  i found myself rooting and fighting for these characters from the first place to the last. i care so much for them. i went to Sabaa Tahir s book tour in Chicago for this book and literally hearing the way she just talks like of course this book is a masterpiece.  i definitely respect the Muslim rep in this book. i felt seen as a Pakistani-American Muslim myself. I was especially connected to the parts in the story that were in Lahore, Pakistan because that is where my family is originally from. Reading the Urdu and Punjabi just made me feel so good.  this quickly turned into one of my favorite books of all time that i know i ll constantly be thinking about in the back of my head.  please look up TWs for this book but the main ones are: islamophobia, racism, drug and alcohol use, loss of loved ones. this is a YA book but it s heavy on the dark topics.  1 book reviews: oof. this is a tough one. its a novel that absolutely requires the reader to be in the right kind of headspace in order to digest it.  for me, all i could think about while reading this is just how much hurt people hurt other people. and the story for sure induced some rage in me.  and thats why i think last chapter or so saved the entire book. without it, all the fury that had built up would have prevented me from enjoying this as a whole. i definitely needed that diffusion at the end, personally.  but because of the content material and relevance of it, i can easily see this being taught in school alongside   2 book reviews: I will gather my thoughts together about this book one day but I have two things to say:  (1) Read this book. Preorder it. Request it from the library. Share it. Teach it in schools.  (2) Please please please look up the triggers/content warnings on this one. This was a difficult read for me in a lot of ways and while I needed to look straight into the darkness, others may not be ready to do so.  Ok, I lied (3) Sabaa astounds as always and I am grateful she shared this story, story, with the world.  3 book reviews: a really quick review   this book is DAMN good. it s been two weeks since I finished this book and i m still thinking about it. ik this is bold of me to say but this is probably the best of Sabaa s books thus far   full review below:  This is a non-spoiler review. Thank you to Penguin Teen for an early copy of this book (honest opinions only).  Trigger warnings for AMR: drug and alcohol addiction, mentions of repressed sexual assault, physical abuse, Islamophobia, racism, death, law enforcement  If you are a fan of Sabaa Tahir, if you are a child of immigrants (or an immigrant to America yourself), if you are Pakistani, if you are Muslim, if you liked any of Khaled Hosseini s books if you trust my opinion   you need to read this book. Whether or not you like contemporaries, I fiercely recommend All My Rage.  I m not sure if I ll ever be able to capture how this book makes me feel. All My Rage is a deep dive into grief, betrayal and forgiveness, loss, and of course, rage. It s an assessment of hope   but not in the way the Ember series was. It s a story with true roots of broken American dreams and hiding so deeply within yourself to protect your heart because you look different from your peers.  It s a YA story with adult themes and yet I think it should be taught in every high school in this country.  I am not Pakistani but I understand Punjabi and Urdu and the visceral experience of having true South Asian representation is a gratifying feeling I will never, ever get used to. Though the Muslim experiences in this book are not ones I relate to, we are not a monolith and the way Sabaa tells these characters  stories and struggles with faith is deeply respectful and not dismissive in any way. I already know many Muslims may not like the Muslim rep in this book but I ask that you all read AMR with an open mind and knowing that every Muslim is different. I am recommending it because it is not dismissive or disrespectful as many other Muslim rep books are of hijabis or those who follow the faith more closely.  I am a deeply emotional person and that is why I connect with Sabaa s writing so vehemently. She captures grief in a way that I ve never been able to express or understand verbally and I cried my EYES out reading this book. It was heart-wrenching and soul-shattering through more than just sadness and heartbreak; I felt seen and vulnerable and that was more than enough to open the floodgates.  If you ve read any of Sabaa s books, you ll know that she knows how to tell a story and how to do revelations. AMR is no different. I would go even as far as to say that All My Rage is her best work   and this is coming from someone who has over 20 copies of the Ember series (and counting). Salahudin, Noor, and Misbah are characters that will live with me for a long, long time to come and to probably no one s surprise, my favorite was Salahudin. Sabaa truly knows how to write men    All My Rage is a love letter to family, Pakistan, music, and to the ties that bind us together. I highly recommend    4 book reviews: Sabaa Tahir: So I-  Me, a very sane fan: 5 book reviews: All My Rage is a devastatingly profound, emotionally moving story exploring the lives of three main characters and their interwoven journeys. It s a story of forgiveness and heartache that focuses on a Pakistani community reeling from grief and destructive choices. Yet, it is a love story of two souls desperate to make sense of all the chaos around their broken worlds.  Misbah, an immigrant, is struggling to run The Cloud 's Rest Motel with her husband Taufiq, who happens to drink all the time. The entire business is on her shoulders. When she finds out she is ill, the pressures of the motel, her alcoholic husband, and other people 's difficulties continue to plague her every waking hour.  Salahudin is the son of Misbah and Taufiq. He s trying to fit in. It s his last year of high school and he s going to ride it out while staying ambiguous to the constraints of being different. When  Sal  gets involved with some dangerous work, he begins to feel the pressure of being discovered. The desire to keep the motel running and operating smoothly puts Sal under more fire.  Noor, an immigrant comes to America at the age of six. Fighting to find an ounce of semblance, Sal becomes her best friend, helping her navigate the chaos of being 'another'. If it wasn t for her Uncle Riaz who dug her out from the rubble, Noor would have died along with her entire family during the earthquake in Pakistan. She should be so grateful to her Uncle Riaz, but his desire to give up his culture and religion puts pressure on Noor. He is mean-spirited and doesn t want Noor to go on to college or have any future besides working at his liquor shop.  Through quiet moments of joy and suffering, the three characters are interconnected in this novel that exquisitely tells a story of truth and forgiveness.  I can t say enough wonderful things about my first time reading a book by Sabaa Tahir. Tahir has a level of eloquence in writing that moves you to reread entire passages. Her sheer generosity with words is breathtaking.  All My Rage touches on many difficult topics: sexual and physical abuse, death, drugs, and prejudice. Yet, Tahir gives respect to every topic, carefully expressing ideas with integrity.  The book does an amazing job of connecting songs to help characters cope with anxiety. I look forward to finding a playlist that has many of my favorites.  Tahir is brave and confident in her storytelling, debunking many myths that newly arrived immigrants and people of color experience. Her graciousness is commendable.  This book was 5/5 stars for me. I ve already begun recommending All My Rage to friends and family.  6 book reviews: So many issues have been raised in this book which is a good thing as we need to address these. Alcoholism, Islamophobia, domestic violence, drug/sexual abuse, and racism, you name it and this book has it. On surface this story seems to be very strong but once i finished it and thought about it I realised that the characters associated with these does not reflect what made them to push into alcoholism, domestic violence, drug abuse or racism. They were just like that. The more I think about the shallower the story and its characters becomes.  I think instead of cramming so many social issues in one story, it would have been better to pick two or three of these and then weave a cohesive story around it. This was just all over the place.  7 book reviews: This was an emotionally heavy read.   You ll feel all the emotions, but also absolute RAGE.   It s sad, it s beautiful and so worthwhile. If you ve not read it yet, move it up on your list!  ! 8 book reviews: devastating, beautiful, heartbreaking, and healing I m going to remember this story forever.  full review to come closer to release date! 9 book reviews: 28/02/2022: unalived me actually i was crying into my pillow at 5 am and couldn t sleep after. SABAA TAHIR NEVER MISSES      thank you to penguin teen for the arc !!  8/12/2021: crying I can t wait for this 10 book reviews: I liked the content of this book a lot, even though the writing style disappointed me a bit. Saaba Tahir tackles so many important topics in All My Rage, including Islamophobia, abuse, substance use disorders, racism, financial stress and more. I felt that she captured the full emotional weight of these issues through her main characters, Salahudin and Noor, and through their journeys she showed us that anger and rage act as appropriate responses to mistreatment and trauma. She also highlights how her characters cope and begin to heal from the struggles they face which felt hopeful though not overly optimistic. Through reading this novel I could feel Tahir s deep care both about these important issues and about her characters.  I only give this book three stars because the writing style distracted me from the story and its characters. I felt at times that Tahir would  overwrite  some of the emotions and thoughts of our protagonists, so it came across as tell and not show. Still, I appreciate this book for the positives it does offer, like two people of color falling for one another romantically and a nuanced portrayal of intergenerational trauma and resilience.  11 book reviews: Ta ksi ka jest pot na. Trudna. Wa na. Chyba jedna z najlepszych powie ci YA, jakie czyta em w tym roku. Dotkn a mnie personalnie w wielu momentach. Wzrusza em si , wkurza em (tak jak bohaterowie) i pr dko o tej ksi ce nie zapomn . Wow, chc  wi cej! 12 book reviews: Initial reaction: This book was EVERYTHING. I cried so much and my heart is still aching. I felt so raw reading it and I can t imagine having the strength to write it. Sabaa already had all my respect and it s since tripled.  I have been reflecting on this book for a while, wondering how to write this review. I read this book in November, and since then, not a day goes by where it does not cross my mind. Sabaa said that All My Rage took her ten years to write. It very well may take me ten years to recover. When we say books have the power to change us, it 's books like this one that do just that.  All My Rage is a story of struggle. It 's a story of loss and love, of failure and success, and of rage and the mercy of forgiveness. This book will leave you raw. And aching. With puffy eyes because you started crying around page 50 and you never stopped. But it 's a story that needs to be told. The struggle of the \"American dream\", of two teenagers stuck in a town with their own individual problems and who somehow still need to lean on each other.  I am going to speak very briefly on the Muslim rep and leave it at that. These characters have a deeply complex relationship with their faith and while it may not be an experience I completely relate to, that does not make it any less valid. The rep is written with the utmost respect for the religion and other Muslims.  There 's a particular scene near the end where a character turns to their faith at their lowest moment, and friends, this scene broke me. There are tears running down my face as I write this review because the amount of grief and emotion in this book is enough to keep me crying months after I read it. I feel as though my soul was shattered by this book, but in a way that I know I will be a better person because of.  I always recommend Sabaa 's books, but this is the one. If you only take one book recommendation from me for the rest of time, let it be this one.  TW: drug and alcohol addiction, mentions of repressed sexual assault, physical abuse, Islamophobia, racism, death, law enforcement, grief   13 book reviews:  She was not of my body or my blood, this child. But she was of my soul. And she had enough fear in her life.   This book is so heartbreaking! No child deserves this abuse and violence from their near and dear ones.  The irony when we tell the young ones to be afraid of strangers while it s the person who s supposed to protect them are the ones actually hurting them.  It s the story of Noor whose mother passed away while she was a kid and whose father is a hopeless alcoholic. She was left under the care of an uncle and her life would go with no one to actually protect her.  It s a story told from three perspectives: one from Noor s, one from Sal (her childhood friend and our male protagonist) and Misbah (Sal s mother).  It s so sad reading their stories as both of them have fathers who are alcoholics and mothers who were suffering from terminal illnesses.  The story deals with passing away of someone close, grief and abuse within the family.  Also, a huge part deals with young people, substance abuse and drug dealing.  I find the writing so heartfelt and beautiful. The characters are so well etched out and they will remain with me forever.  My most memorable character would be Misbah and you will know why when you read the book!  And yes to the subtle romance! I wasn t expecting it you know!  The book has a wholesome closure. It s just. It s beautiful. It s meant to be.  14 book reviews: 5 stars   I wonder what it s like to be with someone who can love you through your rage.   Salahudin and Noor have been best friends since they are little, though recently going through a rough patch in their friendship. But when Salahudin has a family tragedy, Noor is there for him as much as she can be. Sal is faced with running the family business while still in high school with an alcoholic father. Noor desperately wants to go to college and to escape her small town and the uncle she is indebted to.    What a lovely, powerful book. I wasn t a fan of this author s fantasy series, but kept hearing great things about this book. On a whim I bought it from a local indie bookstore and absolutely loved it. It covers a lot of tough subjects and casts empathy on characters who are normally judged harshly. This book was so profound, so moving. While many things were hard to read, I found I couldn t put the book down. You can tell this story was deeply personal to the author and you could feel she put her whole heart put into this book.   15 book reviews: 3.5 stars  Tahir is a talented writer for sure but this book felt like it tackled a few too many social issues. 16 book reviews: 4.5/5 stars  Sabaa Tahir is an exceptional writer. Why had not I read any of her books till now? I would heard about her popularity in book community. I ignored it when my friends kept requesting me to read An Ember in the Ashes.Yes, it 's all on me. What can I say? It happens.  Towards the end of last year, I would noticed this book in want to read update of Victoria Schwab. Not that I am a huge fan of her, (I have not yet read any of her books but, I will in future) I immediately added it to my the list. I have heard great things about Sabaa Tahir. Alas, for one reason or the other, I have not had the fortune of reading any of her books. So, I really wanted to read All My Rage, being a Muslim myself I thought, I would really enjoy reading it. Also, I wanted to be introduced to her writing and her books, and I am glad I decided to read All My Rage as soon as it got published.  Noor 's entire family died in an earthquake in Pakistan. She was saved by her uncle, with whom she lives now in America and work in his liquor shop. She is good in academics, and is working hard to get into a good college, leave Juniper forever, build up a career of her own so that she is no more indebted to her uncle. The sad part of the story being her uncle, who does not want her to get into college. He keeps tab on her every move. Hiding from him, Noor applies for colleges, but has to give interview from her bathroom so that her uncle does not get to know. Will she able to free herself from this life? We shall see.  Misbah is Noor 's aunt. Salahudin is Misbah aunty 's son. Sal and Noor have been best friends since childhood. Sal is too dealing with his share of problem as we notice in the story. Misbah was the one I loved the most reading and knowing about. She is that one invisible thread of hope between Noor and Sal that kept them going on with life. I really felt emotional for her. She is my favorite of the three. It was so disheartening to see her go through so many problems in her life with nobody to share her problems. Despite all that, she remain so strong, positive, and confident about her principles of life, and about humanity.   Told from the first person 's POV, the story has three POVs. We, as humans, are very vulnerable to situations. All My Rage tells us deep and harsh reality of myths that we are surrounded by. Girls are trained to behave like flowers, their education thrown out to the air, career objectives get shuffled, and priorities are shifted towards the male gender.I knew this because I spent a lot of my childhood among people with this perceptions towards life.Today if I have to ask them ane question I will ask - tell me how any of this is a good thing?  Misbah is not going to let this thing happen. And she is not going to leave her children unattended. Sabaa Tahir has done an exceptional job in bringing to life the words and emotions that one can only feel. All My Rage is the story of life, friendship, love, pain, and suffering. The way emotions were put into words is a commendable effort by Sabaa Tahir.   If you are a Muslim, you will love this. I was able to relate to many of the Muslim experiences dekar with in the story. I was very fascinated about the food habits talked about in the book like potato pakoras, kaddu gosht and more. All the punjabi, and hindi dialogues were so masterfully narrated. If you are in hunt if a good emotional heart binding story, you will love it. But, let me warn you, it is difficult book. It will break you from inside, and you will be left sobbing at the end.  This book was a beautiful roller coaster ride of emotions for me. I went into the book to read a simple contemporary story, ended up coming out heart broken with Sabaa Tahir 's beautiful piece of work. I wanted to give it five glowing star. I really wanted to. I was a little bit disappointed at the ending, I wanted to see a better ending for the two of them(Noor and Sal). I so wanted it. Hence, I am reducing that half a star for one little portion of sadness.  I was of the impression of a Fantasy writer who want to try her hands on a different writing style. However, Sabaa Tahir is here to tell us look what I did to your minds with my contemporary YA writing. I am not here to limit myself to one genre, I am going to expand it, and I am going to excel at all of them. Sabaa Tahir is here to win our souls.     17 book reviews: this was SO good 18 book reviews:  I wonder what it s like to be with someone who can love you through your rage.         is the best book I ve read so far this year. Why? it s emotional, provocative, wholesome, heartbreaking, hopeful and just all-around incredible  I fell in love with the characters from the very start; the story touched my heart in so many ways. Sabaa Tahir wrote about grief, what it s like to be hopeless and lost, to survive in a place that just wants to bring you down, to love so deeply that I was able to feel it coming off the pages. She wrote about three kinds of love: family love, friendship love and romantic love and she did all that so beautifully that I just wanted to be a part of it all.  Sabaa s writing style fit the story so well. We had 3 POVS:     (Salahudin s mother): Her chapters were short and far in between. I loved the little snippets into her life and how she talked about Sal and Noor. You could tell she loved them so much      : my favorite She had a hard life; she lost her parents when she was a child and her (asshole) uncle took her in and I just hated him so much. I felt all of Noor s fear, love, hopelessness and rage. She dreams of being a doctor and getting out of Juniper. I just wanted her to get everything she ever wanted I appreciated Noor s attachment to music and how it was her escape when things got hard...Relatable!     : I loved him and all his flaws and how he was doing the best thing he could to save those he loves under the circumstances he was in. I just felt for him so much and wanted to give him a hug and tell him everything would be fine Also, he s a nerd and a bookworm and a writer. More reasons to love him   Noor & Sal s relationship was just the best I tabbed almost all of their scenes together! You can see clearly how much they love and care for each other. And when things only started getting worse for them I just wanted to punch something I felt so angry!! It was so unfair and they didn t deserve all that happened to them but I can understand how that only made them grow individually and together. (that last chapter was such a relief!)  I cried quite a few times. I felt angry and heartbroken. This story took a piece of my heart with every chapter. I felt so connected to everyone and everything.  As a muslim, I absolutely loved the Islam representation it made this story seem even more personal and close to my heart. When Misbah said  If we are lost, God is like water, finding the unknowable path when we cannot.  It made my heart expand   All My Rage also portrays islamophobia, drug and alcohol addiction, physical abuse, the impacts of sexual assault, grief and death, etc...really well. Make sure to check the trigger warnings before going into the story   It comes as no surprise to me that I loved this book; An Ember in the Ashes series is one of my favorites I admire Sabaa s way of telling stories and writing characters and taking us along for the ride Looking forward to all the other stories she ll share with us!  19 book reviews: I ll read whatever Sabaa Tahir writes, but I m super pumped about her pivot into contemporary fiction!  *Thanks to Penguin Teen for an advance review copy! 20 book reviews: i read this book in one day.  it 's an incredible book that delves into the nuances of what it means to be an immigrant and a muslim outside your home country. i cried and tabbed so many pages. i have been looking for a muslim rep experience that does not completely reject islam nor is the \"perfect muslim model\" (because that does not exist) and sabaa tahir delivered. this book is a treasure, showing the perfection of being imperfect.  i cried. the emotional plotlines were a gut punch and the goosebumps i had oh my god.  i adored how faith was never a synonym with weakness and being apologetic. no. it was a synonym with strength.  the tension between sal and noor, their friendship, their love, everything was so raw and beautiful. misbah has my whole heart and i sobbed so much. misbah means lantern in arabic and boy was she a lantern illuminating the way for her two children.  it just occurred to me right this very second that misbah is a lantern that emits light. and noor means light in arabic.  yeah... i am not okay.  21 book reviews: And the award for first book to make me cry this year goes to....  Seriously though, All My Rage is an incredible book. Heartbreaking and hopeful, a story about pain, loss, family, and forgiveness. I have enjoyed fantasy from this author and was curious to see how she tackled a contemporary story.  Told in two timelines, this book primarily focuses on current day but also includes flashbacks to a young woman coming of age in Pakistan and getting married. In the present day, two Muslim Pakistani teenagers who were childhood best friends are dealing with really difficult circumstances. Salahudin 's mom has died, leaving him and his alcoholic father with a mountain of debt and an aging motel. He knows selling drugs is wrong, but it seems like the only option for keeping his family afloat.  Noor is desperate to escape their small town and the racialized bullying she faces, but her uncle- her only surviving family who saved her when a bomb killed the rest of her family in Pakistan- wants her to stay and work in the liquor store he owns. He does not want her getting what he had to give up- a college education. And he hates that she is religious.  This book is beautifully written and will rip your heart out before piecing it back together. I felt so deeply for these characters and Tahir navigates very sensitive issues with grace and compassion. I loved this so much more than I expected it to. I received an advance copy of this book for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.  Content warnings include addiction, drug use, medical scenes, physical abuse (on page), child sexual abuse (off page), racial and religious slurs, panic attacks, grief, death, police interactions, probably others but those are the big ones.  22 book reviews:   dia 14 de janeiro e acho que j  temos um forte candidato a favorito de 2024. Posso dizer com todas as certezas que foi uma agrad vel surpresa e a prova de que realmente preciso de ler mais livros fora da minha zona de conforto.  Este livro foi uma montanha russa de emo es. Senti a tristeza, a dor e a raiva de todas as personagens ao m ximo e vou pensar nesta hist ria durante muito muito tempo.   a prova de que a raiva faz parte de todos n s mas que n o nos define. Acompanhar a evolu o das personagens, a maneira como elas lidaram com as adversidades que enfrentam todos os dias, atrav s da escrita da Sabaa foi extremamente doloroso, mas ao mesmo tempo que me partiu o cora o foi colando-o de novo no s tio.  Se ainda n o leram este livro, que seja o vosso sinal para o fazerem.  23 book reviews: This book discussed some incredibly intense topics of abuse and addiction as well as racism and Islamophobia and loss of a parent. Be mindful of these as you read!  This book follows three perspectives. Present day Noor and Salahuddin, and Misbah in the past. Sabaa did such a phenomenal job making each voice distinct. It was beautiful to see the past and present connect, especially after Misbah s health suffers. Seeing the two characters grapple with their grief in different ways was heartbreaking and beautiful.  There were moments that were hard to read. Salahuddin has to struggle with his father s alcoholism and the neglect he feels while also trying to grapple with his faith and the grief of possibly losing his mother s hotel as her health fails. Noor has a controlling and manipulative uncle that won t let her go to college and wants her to stay far away from Islam.  What I think truly touched me was that their relationship with Islam was complex and it never fell into the rhetoric of  Not like other Muslims  or shaming Muslims who practice differently. Did I relate to this book in terms of the way faith was practiced? Not really. And yet, this book spoke to my core in a way that other books haven t. This explored turning to faith even when you don t feel worthy of it. It explores grappling with guilt and sin and forgiveness. AND IT HURT.  What Sabaa Tahir does best, in my opinion, is show the unfathomable love a mother has for her children. We see that with Sabaa s other books, but this one really focuses on the sacrifices parents make for their children. This book did such a good job of sharing how one life can shape countless others and how one moment can change everything.  I cried near the end because you can feel the struggle in all of these characters and it feels like it s completely rock bottom, and then you see the little bit of hope. It s just as much a story of loss as it is a story of recovery and love.     24 book reviews: a book to read if uve forgotten why u love reading <3333 25 book reviews: Wow. All My Rage was heartbreaking and devastating and beautiful all at the same time. I am frankly still processing everything that happened (this book is quite heavy--please take the CW 's seriously). I can definitely say that this novel needs to be taught in schools everywhere. As a second-gen South Asian-American, I definitely connected with Misbah, Noor, and Salahudin s story so much more in All My Rage than any book typically deemed an American classic. Misbah s journey as a Pakistani immigrant, as well as Noor and Salahudin s exploration of their Pakistani & Pakistani-American identities among their white peers provided such a cathartic outlet when processing my own experiences and relationship with my parents as a second-generation South-Asian American, and I m sure many young diaspora readers will find significant meaning within the pages of All My Rage, as well. I truly just cannot recommend this novel enough, whether or not you ve read Sabaa s previous works. All I know that Misbah, Noor, and Salahudin are going to stay with me forever.  Follow me on | | for more book reviews & recommendations!   26 book reviews: \" In this moment I wish I were a poet - not to speak beauty but to speak pain \"  I can for sure say this is one of those books everyone needs to read , not for the typical reasons but because its a book that has some very important topics and representation . The diversity had me loving it from the beginning .its themes include loss , grief , sexual assault , substance abuse and islamophobia so I would recommend checking the TW before starting it . Some parts of the book were hard to get into and required the right headspace but that makes sense and it should not deter you . A book full of emotions and consequences revolving around Pakistani characters in America each facing their own struggles. It has some romances though its not quite the centre attraction and is a three person POV ( I liked that ) Auntie Misbah is such an inspiration and absolutely loved her and the little snippets of her story .    I love how faith was presented , without shame or clich  .While I could not relate to their way of practicing it I could still appreciate it and I liked how it grew on Noor .There were struggles as a result of islamophobia , they felt real not grandiose or overdone . Not everyone was Islamophobic and the islamophobia was not flounced too openly . I also really loved the characters of Imam and Khadija , those two are a power couple and admirable alongside Misbah herself .  the more i think abt this the more i think i wouldnt actually like it much on reread. or rather i wouldnt stand by this exact rating or review ... yeah i dont remember connecting or rlly liking any character other than misbah who hasnt quite the main focus (if only ). i dont think i liked the romance either and i felt it could be more muslim? butttt yeah its the topics this book handles that makes it appealing and strong .  27 book reviews: 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars. I won t soon forget this story about Salahudin ( Sal ) and Noor. Two high school seniors in Juniper, California (not sure if that is a real place but the author grew up in an area of California that is similar to this book s location)  Sal has lived in Juniper his whole life, his parents own and operate a small motel. They moved to the US from Pakistan after they were married. His mother has a terminal illness (which you will learn about as you read the story)  Noor lost her whole family in an Earthquake in Pakistan, her uncle traveled from California to find his family after the earthquake and only found 6-year-old Noor. He took her home to raise her in the apartment above his liquor store in Juniper. He put his life  on hold  to save her and he never lets her forget it for one minute.  Teenagers have a lot to deal with. It seems these 2 kids have more than their fair share and it s heartbreaking at times.  Sabaa Tahir will tell you this story from alternating points of view and she doesn t pull any punches. If reading about alcoholism, racism, or child abuse are triggers for you, know that all of these are factors in this excellently written story.  28 book reviews:                                                        !                     ...                                             ...                                     !           !  29 book reviews: 28/4/2022: Finally starting, BR with Marie.    ...................................  31/10/2021: Still waiting...5 more months!  ...................................

    " The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts": "book reviews: this book is a tool through which the author, gary chapman, can play out his jesus-complex disguised as a relationship self-help book. there are references from the bible throughout almost every chapter and gary likes to include generous praise from his clients who call him a \"miracle worker.\" it 's damn-near pretty close to being called god.  the book has all the hallmarks of a bestseller: easy to read (i read it in one day); hopeless circumstances that seem beyond repair; and an uplifiting ending. the more bestsellers i read, the more i realize that the formula for mainstream media is not just used in music and movies, it 's used in books, too. ugh, how annoying. i admit, i was almost sold on it, too. the author used just the right amount of despair and at the appropriate moments, instilled hope for a better future. and while hope is not bad at all, the book lacks in addressing the complexity of relationships as well as the diversity of relationships in today 's world. for example, this book may not translate well in multicultural relationships that are dictated by a whole different set of mores and values. also, i wonder how it would be relevant to queer couples or polyamourous relationships. it 's quite apparent that this book is meant for hetero-white-christian-monogamous couples.  but the one major caveat of this book that is not so much a caveat as a poorly disguised advocate of misogyny, is the case of a woman who has been abused (what type of abuse has been perpetrated is not made explicit and gary 's reluctance to do so makes me suspicious of how the church deals with issues of domestic violence). gary 's advice? dismiss any of your own feelings of discomfort (being used for sex) and have sex with your husband as an act of love and hope that he will reciprocate that love. and what i do not understand is how people have overlooked this, even people who are in the psychology field. that 's one thing he does not really address, how to identify your limits and make compromises. if you ca not see the problem with this picture, i pray you never get married. or have a relationship. or speak to people.  the gender roles in this book are fucking archaic. there 's this little section where gary talks about the gender differences in sexual desire. according to him, these differences are all physiologically based. men simply have more tension built-up as a result of massive sperm generation whereas women do not, and that is why women do not crave sex the way men do. instead, women only want sex if their men meet their emotional needs. what, do men not need to have their emotional needs met? are they really just fucking animals who want to empty their over-spermed dicks? why do not they just jack off into a toilet for crying out loud? oops, am i not supposed to mention masturbation in the presence of god? and gary makes women seem like fucking prudes from the latest harlequin romance, the christian edition. gag. this man has very little knowledge of couples outside the realm of christian folklore.  his section on physical touch made me laugh. i was not sure if the lame attempts at humor were to assuage his own discomfort or that of his audience. yes, gary, people have sex. i understand that when you tell me to rub my partner 's leg with my foot that i should make sure i am not rubbing the dog. harhar.  to be fair, he touched on the basic fundamentals of communication with your partner, but i can hardly call this book revolutionary. his book on the five languages of love for children sound more useful just because the developmental stage they are in matches the dumbed-down tone of the book. you would think he was writing for couples who were born in a vaccuum.  i am so over reading new york times bestsellers. we have been brainwashed into accepting that the typical mainstream formula is quality literature. i prefer real talk to fluffy shit, thank you.  1 book reviews: I think the basis for this self-help book is good. I totally get the \"love languages\" thing. My husband 's \"love language\" is Physical Affection and mine is Quality Time. I totally see that. But this is like a \"Love Language For Dummies.\" It talks to you like you are an idiot who has never had basic human social interaction before. And there is not really any advice, just this guy rambling on about how smart he is for figuring out that people need to be loved in different ways. Like, his advice for someone whose spouse (not partner, not lifemate, and - in this instance, always the wife) prefers \"Acts of Service\" as a love language (because wives love when their husband does the laundry for them, basically) is just that -- do the laundry without being asked. Well no shit. That 's not real advice, that 's common sense. And if the husband were to argue \"I do not have time, I work a lot so that I can provide for my family\" blah blah blah, he just says \"WELL MAKE TIME.\" Super helpful, guy.  Not to mention the book is sexist and heteronormative. Unfortunately, I did a little googling on the author AFTER the fact, and of course it is, because he 's a Bible beater. I wish I had known that before I wasted my $7 on the Kindle book. I would really like to see this concept updated and brought into the 21st century, written in such a manner as to A) actually include all walks of life, not just middle class straight white married couples, and B) actually offer advice that can be applied to a relationship.  2 book reviews: This book was recommended to my friend by her pastor to read before she got married. My assumption was that it would be religious in tone and not very relevant to today 's relationships. I am so glad I was wrong! This is one of those books I would suggest everyone read. It is such a simple explanation of what can so often go wrong in relationships. It 's not about men vs. women, it 's about the way people receive love. The basis is there are 5 Love Languages (obviously). And if you speak a different love language than your partner, then you may not feel loved.  The 5 Love Languages are: Words of Affirmation Quality Time Receiving Gifts Acts of Service Physical Touch  I am sure everyone responds to all of these in some way, but we all have a primary language. There is a great quiz in the back that can help you more quickly define yours. By reading the book, I knew what mine was, but the survey pinpointed it to a T and helped me rank mine by importance, even better than I think I could have done on my own. This book will help you in your current relationships (of all kinds, not just romantic) and any future relationships you will have. It really pinpoints how relationships can fall apart after the honeymoon period is over, even if you still love each other. It helps you understand how to show your love for someone else in a way that they will best receive it. I could give a bunch of examples from the book, but I want you to read it! So go get it from the library TODAY. Then share with me what your primary language is! I would love to know everyone 's. Mine is Words of Affirmation.  \"Almost never do two people fall in love on the same day, and almost never do they fall out of love on the same day.\" \"Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself.\"  3 book reviews: This book is based on the premise that everyone has a \"love language\". Things others say or do that make one feel \"loved\",they are follows:   -words of affirmation. -recieving gifts. -acts of service. -physical touch. -quality time.  Personally I want you to tell me how great I am (words of affirmation) while walking in the house with a collection of poetry for me (receiving gifts), make a beeline for the trash that needs to be taken out (acts of service), then come back in and read quietly next to me (quality time) before I ride you like the wild stallion that you are (physical touch) so where does that leave me? Which love language am I? This book was not helpful (as indicated by the shelf it 's on).  4 book reviews: blahblahblahblah Doing what your spouse asks of you makes them love you more. There. I just saved you $14. 5 book reviews: I wo not go into the circumstances which lead to this bizarre buddy read that took place at Disneyland. Sometimes life can be stranger than fiction. I will say that this book has some reasonably helpful thoughts and ideas, but... it is way too simplified and way too heteronormative and way too traditional Christian-value based to speak to me in any meaningful way.  Every single example featured a husband/breadwinner and wife/homemaker (who sometimes worked outside the home) couple. In one example, when the wife was asked to describe something positive about her husband, she says: \"he let 's me keep any money I earn in my part time job\". Another example included a young wife who wished her husband would change the baby 's diaper when he got home from work because she was busy cooking dinner (HIM: I would like her to cook dinner for when I get home from work).... WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!?!?!  The author did not overtly advocate for traditional gender roles in the home, but I could not help but think there was a subliminal message indicating his preference for this. In the one example where the husband seemed to take on a fair share of the cooking, cleaning and other assorted domestic chores, the wife complained. She wanted him to spend more time with her. As it turned out, the wife really wanted to cook and clean, but the husband was too efficient and did not give her a chance to do so. Oh, happy ending. Needless to say, I am crying feminist tears at this point.  Do not get me wrong, I am all for good communication, respect and understanding how to make your spouse feel loved. But when this misogynist flavored relationship guru doled out advice to a woman in a 'horrible' marriage, I took issue. The details of horror of the marriage were largely unsaid, other than it was given that the husband cursed and said he hated his wife. This woman was very religious and clearly the idea of leaving her husband was at odds with her beliefs. Since the husband had no interest in seeking marriage counseling, the author/marriage counselor devised a unilateral plan he admitted did not know would work. The crux of the plan was for the wife to speak to her husband in his love language, and hopefully he would eventually he would reciprocate and the love tanks would start to refill. This plan basically suggested, among other things, that the wife initiate sex with her husband (as his love language was physical touch) even though this idea did not appeal to the wife. Kind of a 'take one for the team' approach. The author clearly said that this was her decision to do so. Ok, so all this has the appearance of consenting adults and informed decisions, so where 's the problem Katie? Oh, I do not know, how about emotional manipulation of the vulnerable? Call me cynical, but I picture an abused spouse reading this and thinking that I just need to have sex with my husband and maybe things will work out.  And that leads me to the other big issue I had with this book. All the case studies were simple and tidy and all had happily ever afters. Not very realistic. This author only cited success stories and provided no useful examples of how this love language thing can go wrong.  Overall, I think the idea of love languages seems reasonable, but I was sorely disappointed in the examples and approaches suggested by the author. At best, he gave an overly optimistic view of how implementing his ideas would work. (and if they do not work the first time, perhaps you could try one of his marriage $eminars or buy more of his book$) At worst, they pander to the emotionally vulnerable in abusive relationships, giving them specious relationship advice.  6 book reviews: So, this is one of those rare books where it was five stars until literally the end and after that...I really just did not feel comfortable giving this book a rating at all.  At its core, this book had a great message.  Across cultures and religions there 's the underlying theme of finding love...but what about maintaining it? Nurturing it through the years?  That 's where comes into play.     The idea is that everyone has a love language, and what communicates love to one person might not necessarily be the same for the other.  And up until that point of the book and it resonated very deeply with me. This book was verbalizing something that I had noticed for years but just did not have the words for it.  After all, who has not picked up on the fact that different people like different things?  To some people - (i.e. flowers, post-it notes with heartfelt messages and small surprises) are what shows that you care.  And to others - having someone to spend with you (ie doing chores together, playing a game, or going on a date) is what matters most.  \"I love you\" or \"You are beautiful\" or \"You are amazing\" in order to know that the other person cares.  I also liked how the author explained that love is work, that it takes a conscious effort to manifest and that it makes all the difference.  And while there were a few moments that seemed or got a bit heavy-handed with religion, I could take it with (remembering that the book was written in the 1990s and that those moments were not the focus/core concept of the book).  It was really the last example in the book that rubbed me the wrong way.  Up until that point, the author would explain a concept, provide examples of it and an anecdote of how it works in real life. And yes those examples were sometimes a bit simplistic/rosy-colored but ultimately I feel like it worked well.  The last example of the book was supposed to be the one that was the end-all-be-all test of the Love Language Theory.  And (spoilers ahead) Gary Chapman was able to save the marriage by letting the wife get...hmm...I do not know entirely if it would be but it was borderline enough to make me feel very, very uncomfortable reading it.  Now, I do think I should preface with this is just my interpretation of the woman 's story and there very well might be further extenuating circumstances that I am yet unaware of that might sway me to Chapman 's side  Essentially the last woman in this book is being by the husband. We are not given a TON of examples but it is heavily implied that this situation untenable - that the woman could not live like this anymore.  BUT she did not want to get divorced because...reasons. Some religious but also part of her remembered her husband before he became so monstrous.  So Gary, after being assured that she isto save her marriage, discusses his \"plan\". Gary believes that her husband does not feel loved and that 's why he lashes out.  The author and the woman go over the love languages. I do not remember what hers was but the  Now physical love language can manifest itself in a few ways - could be that you just crave touch - hugs, hand-holding, resting head-on-shoulder during movies, or snuggling at night. Or it could be sex.  I am sure you can imagine what the woman 's husband wanted.  It boiled down to she felt horrible because of the way he treated her and did not want to have sex with him which (according to the author) was the root of why the husband was so cruel.    The brilliant plan was for her to have sex with her husband - even though she did not \"feel\" like she wanted to. And to stop her nagging him and essentially just pretend their marriage is going well.  I do not know if this is because while it is clear that the woman does not want to have sex, she does go willingly to bed but that 's only because Gary told her it is the only way to save her marriage and get her loving husband back. So. Maybe not rape but definitely made me feel awful for her.  anyway because her marriage is saved.  Now, I will admit thatthis example. I feel like there are just some marriages that are not worth saving - and as soon as you cross the line towards sustained abuse, that 's it.  And perhaps if the author had degrees in the field (Note: The author had MA in anthropology, masters in religious ed and PhD in adult ed but not in the field of question (clinical psychology/licensed therapist) (as far as I can tell)) or he had consulted with a professional...and if the only solution proposed was something other than \"weekly sex with husband and stop complaining to him\" I would feel differently but to me, this situation was serious enough to opposed to armchair diagnosing the husband as sex-deprived.  Never does the author broach the subject of marriages that to end in divorce. Never does he talk about what to do if you ca not do it anymore. It felt like he was just pushing this love-as-the-only-answer narrative too far with that last example.  The ending just hit such a sour note for me - and I had loved this book so deeply before it.   7 book reviews: My mother in law gave me this book and I hesitated reading it because it sounds so cheesy (and just take a look at the cover--how dorky!) But I was stuck on vacation with nothing else to read so I reluctantly gave it a try. In a nutshell, this book has changed my life. Page after page I found myself wanting to yell, \"yes! Thats exactly right!\" If I could give this more than five stars, I would. Okay, maybe \"changed my life\" is a bit strong, but it has certainly enhanced my marriage like nothing else I have ever read or done. The advice this author gives is so profound and universal, it can be applied successfully to any deep relationship you have (children, parents, close friends). I just ca not recommend it highly enough. Every couple, whether newly together or old marrieds, could benefit from this book.  8 book reviews: This was recommended by a  friend  of my wife, which proves part of the old adage:  A friend of thy wife, is thine enemy .  That s from the Bible or the Decameron or Archie Comics.  I think.  I ll do the whole would-it-kill-you-to-read-something-positive-with-me-for-a-change thing in order spend some time with my wife. Plus, bonus, the audio book was relatively short.    I ve had to read a few scoops of self-help literature over the years, so I m down with the lingo:  Annie Wilkes s How to Win Friends and Influence People.    I m OK (Neurotic, OCD, manic-depressive), You re OK (Nymphomaniac, Daddy issues, Passive-aggressive).    Untying my  inner child  from the radiator and letting him have ice cream with my  toxic  parents.    Books that give you a  thought for the day , you know, something cosmic and revelatory to think about and chew on for eternity (or until you close the book).      Well, as a way to work into that, fanatical (and borderline crazy) Goodreader, let me explain the good doctor s theory on the FIVE languages of love. Basically, we all speak a primary language and we all have a language of love that we learned from mommy and daddy.  One of languages of love.    Five! Count  em, Five!    What was that number again?    So, that number is five, right?      According to Dr. Chapman, the five languages are:    Now, I m done.  1) Giving gifts   If the last time you gave your wife flowers was when Nirvana was a thing, then this one isn t you.  2) Words of affirmation   These don t include:  You re an idiot/moron/devil/shrew/succubus etc.   3) Acts of Service or doing stuff for your loved one or something   Helping my wife bury the hoochies that chase after our son qualifies here.    4) Quality time      It s not me, me, me. Maybe your wife, wants to hang with you and do stuff, like, I don t know, talk   5) Physical touch   It s not only smexy times, but just being there, being present.    Note to wife: Please treat every day like my birthday!  So, in a nutshell, recognize your love language and your spouse s love language and try to accommodate them in some small way.  If I ve saved your marriage, you re welcome or just send me a check. Make it out to  CASH .  Warning! The doctor likes to work in the Christian stuff and this is strictly a hetero tome, so if the first is a turn off and you find the second limited, look for help elsewhere. And like anything in this world that makes money, Chapman has written enough additional books on this subject to choke a Tijuana stage show donkey.  9 book reviews: A quick and valuable read to help you better understand how you and your partner best like to express and receive love. Great for helping you see what you truly value in a partner and what your partner truly values in you. 10 book reviews: Ein kurzes Buch mit ganz viel Inhalt. Dabei ist der Inhalt eigentlich selbstverst ndlich, m chte man meinen. Man sollte seinem Partner zeigen, dass man ihn liebt und die Liebe nicht einschlafen lassen. Lob und Anerkennung, Z rtlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft geh ren beispielsweise dazu. Eigentlich selbstverst ndlich, aber es ist gut und auch wichtig, sich dieses immer mal wieder ins Ged chtnis zu rufen. Daf r ist dieses Buch ideal; es regt zum Nachdenken und Reflektieren an. Mir hat es sehr gut gefallen!  11 book reviews: 12 book reviews: 4.5 stars  I absolutely recommend this book to EVERYONE. Whether you are married, dating, single, whatever. The ideas and concepts in this book will benefit any relationship. The idea of loving others the way they need to be loved might feel counterintuitive, but it something so essential to growing as a person and understanding what love really is.  I had always known about this book and the love languages, but this was the first time I actually read it. Of course, as with any self-help type of book, there were a few cheesy moments, which is why I docked it half a star, but overall it was a fantastic read!  13 book reviews: The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate, Gary Chapman  The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate is a 1992 book by Gary Chapman.

Chapman told her to stay in the marriage for six months, and do ALL the emotional labor and follow  the teachings of Jesus.  I fear for her safety. Ann s closest friends, who presumably knew of her situation, told her to get out.

Hell, I can even go as far as to say that it had pretty good points for someone new to relationships.  Now that I m writing this review, I don t think I can hold back because the remaining part of this book is fucking trash and I have to talk about it!  If you ve ever been in a relationship where there s healthy communication, I think all the advice given by the author won t sound so revolutionary. That 's because you don t have the fancy words to label the ways you show your love to your partner.  But, I don t want to drag this book down completely as I feel that this has some good points in the beginning.  Love language  is a metaphor for the actions you take to show your love for your partner which results in a full love tank i.e. satisfaction in a relationship.  After the emotional high of love wears off AKA honeymoon phase of the relationship ends, it leaves us with the reality that the person we are with is not as perfect as we had once imagined. In this situation, we have to make efforts to sustain love and cultivate intimacy.  All of this is fine until the author ruins everything by attempting to save the relationship of a woman who has been abused. Using religion, he manipulates her to have sex with her husband (because his primary love language is physical touch). I m not even exaggerating this. I found it wrong and vile.  If he had given the same advice to a man, I d be angry too. But this is especially disgusting because, in many cultures and communities, women are told to just put up with the abuse or sweep it under the rug. I just cannot believe he gave this advice using such pleasant words.  It takes two to be in a relationship. It should be the decision of two people to make it work. If only one person is putting in efforts while the other person couldn t care less, it s best to give up because this is an unhealthy dynamic.  It was wrong on his part to give such advice to the vulnerable woman who was in a dilemma of whether she should stay with her abuser or leave. It just plays into the mentality that a good girl can fix a bad guy if she loves him enough. We should wonder about something else. Is the guy even worth loving? Short answer: No. Long answer: HELL NOOOOOO!  Secondly, he talks about how a relationship can be revived even after there has been sexual infidelity. I m neither an expert in the field of dating and relationships nor have I read any research papers or statistics, but I feel there should be a line that cannot be crossed.  In my opinion, certain actions should be forbidden and considered the last straw in relationships for eg, cheating, abuse, and some other serious offenses (murder?).  I think aiming to make every relationship work by applying the love language rules is idealistic and unrealistic. Sometimes, people just aren t compatible. There might be a hundred reasons for not being together. I don t think all problems can be solved by applying the five simple rules.  All in all, read the first 70% of the book as it is sensible. For the rest, hurl the book out of the window and forget about it.  21 book reviews:        : -        -                                                                                                ...                                                                                                       .  22 book reviews: Gary Chapman, a marriage councillor (and pastor), comes up with 5 basic ways that people use to express (romantic) love: - words of affirmation - gift giving - acts of service - quality time - and physical touch  He also, very daringly, theorises that all marital problems are caused by the participants' lacking language skills, i.e. them having different ways of expressing love. In his defence, Mr. Chapman spends coming up with increasingly looser definitions for said love languages to support his claim... so he might as well be right by the end.    For all my hatred of the self-help/self-improvement genre in general, I am fairly lenient when it comes to qualifications I require from authors writing these books. As long as they are fluent, are not boring me and try to make a modicum of sense, I am willing to give them a chance. , 9 times out of 10, I end up disappointed but no one can say I did not at least give them the benefit of doubt.  I mainly view these kinds of books as advice from some \"well-meaning\" busybody intent on sharing their coping mechanism with the world. Had this book been a 2-page essay, I would not even have considered it all that bad...    part is how he explains/illustrates the mistake in difference of communication: like not just lobbing (empty) praises at someone who wants to see action. He also makes a valid point in people not handling the difference between the long-term more sedate pace of love and the initial passionate falling in love phase.  part is in fact mostly due to the specific examples with which Chapman chooses to illustrate his concepts. Though I give him props for changing some of his more sexist anecdotes from the first editions, he still has some very problematic ones. Off the top of my head, the one where he makes the husband listen by literally repeating the wife 's complaints word for word. And later he suggests to a woman whose husband constantly screams and belittles her, that she should have sex with him more often... among other things. Dunno about you, but outside of some very dubious BDSM scenarios, I ca not see this ending well.    And part is how almost of his patients are ambushing him. Maybe this is my modern, scheduling-oriented self speaking, but did people in the 60s and 70s just walk up to councillors and start pouring their hearts out... whereEVER? Or is this just a cultural(ly rude) thing where people 's personal time is not meant to be respected?    I think I should make this official: most popular books give me allergies. No really, you should see how the mere mention of Oprah 's name has me break out in literal (i.e. metaphorical) hives. Additionally, I spent three quarters of the allocated reading time having to start the book.... so there was I was ever going to like it.  Apparently there are 2 versions of this book, with the 2nd edition (from 2015) being the more \"\" one for the contemporary reader. Having gone through the first half of the first edition, I can tell you that the general idea remains the same and the overall traditional Christian undertones are still very keenly felt through both versions.    Alternately, I am told that my religious tolerance is ridiculously low, for someone living in a predominantly Christian society.  23 book reviews: I found this book useful without being preachy and guilt ridden. Gary Chapman is a marriage genius. I felt like I was in couple 's therapy without paying hundreds an hour. He used Jesus as an example once, for anyone avoiding religious text.  As we all know marriage is hard and it is a daily choice to love but after the honeymoon bliss is over can we still have a happy marriage? Did the other person suddenly change or did we change without thinking about it?  There 's so much static in our daily lives; work, bills, kids, money, climbing the social ladder, other people, resentment, exhaustion etc. We start to take our relationship for granted and it starts to surface as anger and hate.  So in 5 steps you find your way toward a more loving, enjoyable partner bc of the way you love him. Chapman does not promise easy; he promises a happier emotional love tank which can make the marriage reborn.  WORDS OF AFFIRMATION QUALITY TIME RECEIVING GIFTS ACTS OF SERVICE PHYSICAL TOUCH  Which fills you up? Which fills them up?  Side note: I discovered WORDS OF AFFIRMATION makes me feel loved.  His first is: PHYSICAL TOUCH and second QUALITY TIME  24 book reviews: Chapman used many real-life examples from his own marriage, and of couples that he had counselled across the years, to illustrate the concepts in his book and how they can be applied to address different marriage/ relationship issues and circumstances. These are case studies help us to identify similarities and lessons for our own relationships.  In the book, he also offers 2 pages of additional ideas and suggestions for each of the 5 love languages, as well as separate love language profile surveys for husbands and wives (to identify your primary love language). If you enjoyed the ideas in this article, do get a copy of The 5 Love Languages from Amazon  25 book reviews: I would never have read this book on my own but was urged to read it after a debate with a friend of my roommate. It 's written by a marriage counselor and directed towards couples, but it can be applied to all relationships, both romantic and platonic. The author 's theory is that there are five major ways to express love (the five love languages). Each of us has a primary love language, and relationship problems occur when others fail to express love to us in that language. It 's an interesting theory but WAY oversimplified, and I was extremely bothered by one of the real life stories where the author encourages a wife to stay with an abusive husband and rescue their marriage by learning his love language. That 's crap! The book is written from a religious perspective, and I struggled a lot with that as well. Overall, I was not so impressed, but I did conclude that my love language is Quality Time, and I have been surprised by how much insight that has provided into how I operate in relationships. For that alone, it gets two stars instead of one.  26 book reviews: This year I am doing a Reading Challenge; so I have 26 books with specific subjects that I need to read. BOOK21: A book that will improve a specific area of your life  I think every married couple should read this at least once. Do the quiz and know what Love Language your partner speaks.  For the advice given in this book I give a five star rating. The writing on the other hand was not that good. He tends to \"speak\" down to the reader, making you think - I am not that stupid. Also he repeats himself A LOT!  Reading this I think is the easy part: to practice what suggest is the difficult part.  27 book reviews: Before I start in on the reasons why I did not like this book, let me mention the good parts of it. As someone who just got married, I value ideas about how to strengthen a lifelong relationship, and the book did have some good ideas. It 's always good to be reminded that I should be looking for little things I can do to make my spouse happy, that even if I am happy with everything in a relationship I should be checking in with my spouse to make sure he 's happy too, etc.  I have always thought personality quizzes were fun and this book has a certain appeal because of that. There is something fun about trying to discover your \"love language\" and your spouse 's, and see what that says about you both. Just to establish, the 5 Love Languages in the book are Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Receiving Gifts. I can see how in certain instances, thinking about the love languages could strengthen communication in a relationship. For instance, if one spouse really communicates most strongly with physical touch but that does not come naturally to the other partner, they might feel unloved until the other partner learns to show love through physical touch.  Finally I appreciated how the book suggested mindful, practical ways to maintain a relationship over time. It talks a lot about the \"in love\" experience at the start of a relationship and how that 's different than developing a lifelong, sustaining love. It reminded me of a quote from an Adrienne Rich poem: \"I choose to love this time for once / with all my intelligence.\" To me, loving with intelligence means that once those crazy feelings of infatuation at the beginning of a relationship subside, and you and that other person start to see each other 's flaws, to learn about them as an individual and not an ideal you have built up in your own head, you still to love them (or, if you see that they are abusive or mistreating you, etc., you choose to end that relationship and love someone else who respects you).  I think in a lot of our TV shows, books, and movies, there are two kinds of relationships: the young lovers who emerge victorious at the end of a romantic comedy, perfectly in love and just starting out with their lives, or the middle-aged married couple who nag each other and take it for granted that romance and sex are off the table permanently. It 's kind of a sad pattern that I definitely do not want to be true in my own marriage. So to circle back to the book, I did appreciate that it was very practical about how to consciously nurture the love in a relationship; it does not assume that once the honeymoon is over, things will fall apart.  But I still gave this book a 1-star rating. Even though it brought Adrienne Rich to mind, Gary Chapman is no Adrienne Rich. It 's kind of a bumbling mess written by someone with maybe a slight Jesus complex. I noticed that even though platonic love is discussed, every example of a romantic couple in the book is a heterosexual couple and the book presumes, consistently, that the only form of acceptable romantic love is between a man and a woman in a Christian marriage. It was also openly against open or polyamorous relationships. I understand because I am not interested in that for myself--but I would not judge someone who wants a non-monogamous relationship, because it 's all a matter of personal choice. I did not like that the book assumes so much or that Chapman feels he can tell people what 's best for them.  I also think too much emphasis is placed on finding your one true love language. Yes, I did just say personality tests are fun, but while reading the book I really connected with several of the love languages described almost equally. It 's nice when my spouse compliments me, but it 's also nice to hold hands with my spouse, or when he does the dishes for me, or gives me a gift, or when we spend quality time together; I ca not really differentiate between the niceness of those different things. Yet the book really insists everyone has one love language and maybe one secondary love language. It smacks of someone trying to sell me something and I do not like that. It 's also kind of creepy and weird to read about all these troubled couples who host Chapman in their homes for the night while he 's traveling for seminars, just to beg him for marital advice. Reminds me of televangelists who prey on their flock. I am wary of self-help books to begin with, I only read this one because I have heard good things about it, but it reinforced my view; I do not need to be sold on the idea of love or preached to about it.  My biggest problem, which came close to the end of the book, is one example Chapman gave of how the miraculous love languages work. A woman came to Chapman who was so sick of her marriage, she was on the cusp of leaving, because her husband did not care about her at all anymore. All her friends were telling her to get out. She said she hated him and asked Chapman, \"can you love someone you hate?\" Which of course he decided to meditate on by reading the Bible. OK, I can dig it; the Bible has some good quotes and advice even if you are not religious. In fact I have no problem with the words of Jesus Chapman chose to share with this woman--love thy neighbor, treat others as you want to be treated, if you give a measure it will be returned to you until your cup runneth over, etc (I am paraphrasing because, lazy).  OK so that 's all fine. But then Chapman is all, \"what 's your husband 's love language?\" and she says \"physical touch\" and he 's like \"well you need to touch him and have sex with him more\" and she says \" and he says I AM NOT KIDDING. I laughed as my valuation of the book instantly crumbled before me into sad, atheist dust. It 's not directly expressed in the book, but this lady basically hints that her husband is verbally, if not physically, abusive and at the very least totally negligent and uncaring. Well of course the suggestion works and he starts to come around and love her back in her own \"love language\" but any respect I had for the book disappeared at that point.  Also, even though as I have said I am all for choosing love and loving with intelligence, some of the suggestions Chapman has are just laughable. For instance, every day you should ask your spouse \"how full is your 'love tank' on a scale of 1 to 10?\" and then if it 's less than 10, you are supposed to do something to \"fill their love tank.\" I am sorry but I just ca not with that childlike, pandering language. You can choose to love mindfully without teetering over into this totally clinical, almost bureaucratic method.  FINALLY, and this review is so long now I know nobody is reading at this point but oh well, all of the advice is totally directed at middle-aged couples who have basically fallen out of love, so a lot of it was not applicable to me. Also, a lot of the advice is the really basic flavor (listen to each other, give your spouse undivided attention, give your spouse little gifts or notes to remind them how much you love them) you could get anywhere, that honestly should just be common sense by the time you are married. And finally finally finally, the \"love languages\" are nice and all, but I can see so many instances where troubles can arise in a marriage that the love languages could not fix. For instance, disagreeing about money/family/politics, if one partner is downright abusive or uncaring or habitually cheating, if a partner withdraws to the point where they wo not do anything to help fix the relationship despite how strongly you are speaking their \"love language.\" The end. Phew.  28 book reviews: This is a book that everyone should read at least once. it is imperative to know how you need and express love so that you know how to ask for the type of love that you need to feel fulfilled and happy in a relationship. It is also essential to know how to give the love that your partner needs to feel fulfilled so that the balance stays on top.  I love that this book can tie in a dash of religion without being preachy and alienating others! Bravo Gary Chapman!  Definitely worth a read! 4.5 Solid Stars! I already went and bought a copy to share.  29 book reviews: The author says love is a choice. He says that the infatuation that people experience in the beginning of the relationship is not real love. It is something else. Real love takes work while the infatuation period is instinctual and effortless. But is not it the stuff we dream of and wish would last forever? Can we really accept that we will only get that chance at the beginning of the relationship and that thereafter, in order to remain monogamous, we must accept that it is not for us to feel ever again? It explains a lot. But I accept his theory with the angst of a romantic.  Yet anyone who is married and holds married life as a value that must be maintained must at some point consider the notion that making the marriage work after the honeymoon can be a matter of personal choice. And in so choosing, there are actions that communicate that willingness to different people psychologically. These are the five love languages that the author discusses: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Giving Gifts, Acts of Service, Physical Touch. I will not go into any details of what is meant by each of these here. The titles are somewhat self-explanatory, with the exception of the last one, which does not necessarily refer to sex. The author explains each love language along with the concept that most people are chiefly responsive to just one. He also discusses how to determine your own as well as your spouse 's, and even provides some optimistic advice on how to practice the love languages with an unreciprocating partner. Despite the author 's Christian underpinnings, as a non-Christian, to me this did not detract from the relevance of the author 's ideas.  In fact, these \"love languages\" are not confined only to the marriage relationship, but may also serve to strengthen bonds with children - or perhaps any other person you need to communicate your love and support for. I especially found the chapter on children the most valuable because it not only expands the concept beyond the marriage relationship, but also drives home the point. We might have a choice as to whether we wish to stay married or not - but our children are ours forever.  And this brings me back to the point about marriage. Far from being ready to claim mastery of the ultimate male-female partnership, I have reflected upon it a great deal. In an age where the divorce rate challenges the age-old institution upon which the family is built, one must ask how marriages were ever successful in the past. Some may point out that they really were not, but that society simply forced two people to be miserable by making it taboo to separate. And this then begs the question, why would the world 's varied cultures and divinely inspired religions condone this relationship again and again? In fact, I would venture to point out that for the vast measure of our recorded history marriage has not only been a standard, but has also been traditionally arranged! What ancient wisdom allowed such \"life-sentences\" to form such a firm foundation for the basic building block of society?  I suspect the answer lies right here in this book. As hard as it may be to admit, the commonplace yearning for finding a new and exciting fling is quite likely an unfortunate addiction to a desire that in its very nature is meant to be only a temporary rush that pulls two people inexplicably together at the heart during their initial engagement. It is later, through maturity and insight into what makes the other person tick that we can choose to make each other perpetually happy and foster the bonds of enduring love. This book provides some valid insight into this process. It is light and easy reading that I think every couple should invest some time into, again and again.  MM March 1, 2005  ",
    " The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel)": "book reviews: For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma   yeah, I loved it shamelessly, warts and all .  And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe . The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why? You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what s right. But makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become.    Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that s what Collins did well here  I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice.  The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant   you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it.   and that s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.  Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn t become prey. , and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle. It s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his   and wants it only Don t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one   that would be too cheap. No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took   and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.    Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn t root for anyone. Now I can reread trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.       Also posted on .  1 book reviews: Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest   DNF @ p.101        Me: So what do you like to do for fun?    TBoSaS: Cabbage soup.    Me: Uh huh.    TBoSaS: Roman names.    Me: Uh huh. *signalling desperately to the waiter for a glass of wine* Those are not really hobbies you know.    TBoSaS: Hobbies?    Me: You know, things that give your life meaning.    TBoSaS: Oh.    Me: Yeah.    TBoSaS: Does hating on the poors and being surprised that they have feelings count?    Me: This date is over.    So, nobody was looking forward to THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES more than I was and if they say they are, they are . Even though a prequel with Coriolanus Snow seemed a bit like a cash grab, I was still willing to put down a \"soul of my firstborn\" down payment to get my grabby little hands on a copy of this book because I love a good villain origin story.    Keyword: good.    I think the problem here is that it feels so impersonal and boring. The first three books were all narrated in first person and had tautly written action scenes so everything felt very in the moment and urgent. We see the Capitol from Katniss 's eyes as this glittering bacchanalia of conspicuous consumption while she and her people are literally starving and she is horrified that she has to compete to the death for the entertainment of these awful people who do not care whether she lives or dies as long as she puts on a good show. Children, for these people, are just another commodity.    Here, it does not really work. We already know that the Capitol looks down on the other districts. Seeing Coriolanus bitch and moan about being in genteel poverty while in the same breath whining about how his mentoring Tribute is from the grodiest district does not really add anything new to the narrative. And it does not help that Lucy Gray is a manic pixie dreamgirl who literally arrives on stage in a frilly ruffled dress, singing stupid songs that take up waaaaay too much of the page count.    And if I heard Coriolanus talk about his fecking cabbage soup .    I ca not. I just ca not. RIP my untarnished memories of the original series, because this bloated 500-page mess crapped all over it. I think the author would have been better off writing about the first Hunger Games, or one of the games that took place in extreme conditions (like the arctic one), or maybe about a more sympathetic character, like Haymitch or Finnick. I would LOVE to read about Haymitch or Finnick 's competitions in the Games and seeing how they got to be the fucked up and jaded individuals that they were in the books. That is the kind of subtle darkness that I expected from the series. I wish it had panned out with this one, but I was mostly just really, really bored.    Date over. And I hope you know, you are paying for that wine, TBoSaS.    1 star  2 book reviews: I feel absolutely drained by this book.  Because I was such a big fan of The Hunger Games trilogy, I was determined to finish The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, but doing so took a LOT out of me. What a chore this book was! I now understand the disappointed and outraged reviews of others who read it first, but what I do not understand is how those people were still able to blast through this in a day or two. You guys are far tougher readers than I am.  I have to confess that I was initially enthusiastic about this book being told from Coriolanus Snow 's perspective. I know it put some people off, but one of the few things I love more than a good villain is a good villain origin story. No, I did not expect to sympathise with him, but could I understand how he would gotten so messed up and evil? Well, maybe.  But... I do not think it works. For so many reasons, but a major one for me is that this book is so boring. So meandering, unfocused, dry. There 's a lack of urgency and emotion. A lack of any connection with the characters outside of Snow, who is so self-serving and self-pitying that I could not even have fun hating him. I could not understand what we were reading for. I had no real questions that needed answering. This book added nothing to the Panem universe.  And the \"romance\" was just downright unpleasant.  The plot takes us back to the 10th Hunger Games, where Coriolanus Snow is assigned as the mentor to the district 12 candidate, Lucy Gray (whose songs are the one shining light in this novel). Coriolanus sees this as an opportunity to shake himself free of the hardships of the past and improve his social status. Lucy 's potential victory becomes deeply-entwined with Coriolanus 's own, and their relationship is a discomfiting mix of romantic feelings and him using her to achieve his own means.  But, still, while this is unpleasant, I do not think I am half as bothered by it as I am by how utterly dull the story is. I am not so refined as to be above some trashy drama, but that 's the thing: it 's not dramatic. It 's lifeless and cold. 90% of the plot exists inside Snow 's head. He tells us about the supposed hardships he has had to endure, but we never really feel them. And something about his perspective makes every other character he encounters seem dull also.  A few others noted that this book picks up at the end, which is possibly the only thing that carried me through. It does, but I can also say it was far too little and far too late for me. I think the only good thing about my lack of connection with this book is that I can safely say I do not even consider this part of the same universe as the original trilogy. I can now go forget about it.  |  3 book reviews: Only last 20 pages of this book managed to stir my interest. So, is this 1 or 2 stars? If I hate read the rest of it? Okay, I will be generous. 1.5 stars it is, but there is no way I am rounding this up.  The problem with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is that it does not know what it wants to be until the very, very end. It meanders here and there, bloated, unfocused, wordy, boring, misguided, treading the same water on and on and on, to the point of tedium. Just to get to the climax where Snow needs to decide if he wants to be good and poor and in love or bad and successful. I kept waiting for some grand twist or revelation to happen. What I got was a tiny splash of excitement after 500 of uninspired blah.  There are failures of every type in this novel. Snow 's evolution is convoluted, drawn out, poorly paced, and entirely too much time is spent on lingering on his sob stories of poverty, school demerits and cabbage soup. His inner world is neither explained well nor is it interesting. This is not a successful villain origin tale. You will never convince me that it is. Too many new characters are introduced, but none of them are memorable. There is not one person of Haymitch 's caliber, or Cinna s, or Effie 's. There is an attempt to show the dawn and messiness of the early Hunger Games, with all the gore and DYI-horror, but it 's diluted by the wrong perspective, weird Capitol apologia and a BIG BAD, super-boring first game maker villain. There is a romance that it totally unbelievable and an incomprehensible joke.  I literally spent 99% of this book with this expression on my face. (I wish I were exaggerating.) None of what was happening made any sense, especially the romance (gag).    I do believe there is a decent story somewhere in this mess of bloated mediocrity, a story that should have been told by Lucy maybe? But as is, this is a massive failure of execution. The pacing is off, the themes are muddled, there is no passion, there is no urgency, there is no heart, there are no stakes. There is, of course, Lucy who was badly underserved. And her songs (too many?). Two potential positives totally wasted on this travesty of a novel.  I am not touching this book ever again, and I am going to try to forget it ever existed.  A heartbreaking fiasco.  ____________ Not sure I liked this excerpt or the idea of redeeming a monster. Still, hope dies last...   ____________ Never expected this one to happen...  4 book reviews: - i did truly find the nods to the original trilogy fun. finally finding out the origin of the hanging tree song, why snow despised katniss so much from the get-go, how certain features of the games were implemented, etc. was really interesting. that being said, i have seen a number of reviews say that this read like fan fiction, and i honestly kind of agree. the way that every single loose end from the original story was tied up felt a lot like fan service to me, and while as a fan of the original trilogy i gladly ate that shit up, i do not think any of it was a needed addition to the overall world.  - snow 's character felt like an afterthought in his own book?? I was surprised by what a passive protagonist he was for the majority of the story, and he lacked the detail and nuance that would have made this a compelling character study. while i liked that we got to see how easily he was able to manipulate others from the start, his overall transition from the little, privileged weasel of the first two parts to the actual villain in part three was entirely abrupt and unsatisfying.  - the pacing of this was also wonky as heck. the first 450 pages were moving at the pace of a snail (that 's a fact, not a complaint. i enjoyed the slower bits more) compared with the breakneck pace of the final 60 pages, i got whiplash.  - the ending (no spoilers) but while i thought snow 's portion wrapped up way too quickly just as he was getting interesting, there was enough left hanging with *cough* other characters *cough* that i truly would not be surprised if we got a sequel to this story, and idk how i feel about that.  not sure what else to say....basically, unpacking more of panem 's history was an ambitious idea on collins' part, and i think it could have been done well (maybe as part of a collection of novellas?) but, this book was just far too long and failed to strike a good balance between snow 's story and the exposition of the early games.  5 book reviews: always trust your gut.  for example, here is my initial note on this book:  do i want to read this book?  no.  well, i do not think so.  okay i am going to leave this here just in case  and if i had just gone with that feeling and absolutely sprinted in the opposite direction, we would not be here right now.  writing a rant review about a book whose main crimes are being boring and not as good as the actual series it 's a prequel of.  see? even my complaints about it are not interesting.  like, for example, this million page long book would be more like 40 if you took out every usage of the protagonists' incredibly long names (coriolanus and lucy gray, which they say CONSTANTLY and always IN FULL), plus the words cabbage soup, for some reason.  if you took out every reference to the title we would not have a book at all.  and, for another example, what if i told you this was one of the suckiest romances of all time, so awful i am forced to use the already made up term \"sucky\" to the fullest extent english grammar will allow me. a love story between two boring teens, one who is classist and misogynistic and hateful and boring, and one who is poor and a woman and saccharine and also boring.  what if, hypothetically, the lucy gray character 's main personality trait is that she writes and performs songs, and what if the songs are unbearable and corny even as everything else in the book rides on our ability to believe they, for lack of a better word, slay?  what if everything that made the hunger games so appealing and well-done - the action, the satire, the quiet and subtle moments of revolution - did not exist here?  and have you considered if the whole thing were so boring it feels like it could be charged in international court?  yeah.  not good.  bottom line: get in, loser. we are going to trust our instincts and avoid unnecessary additions to beloved series  6 book reviews: 2023 update: I reread this book because watching the movie reignited my interest and I wanted to see if I could read this book with better appreciation now that young Snow is hot lmao. Sadly, I am keeping my original rating, as not even my thirst is enough to keep my interest. I enjoyed the movie 's direction more (we see more of Lucy Gray and the world, Snow 's character arc is a subverted \"hero 's journey\" instead of flat, etc) and the book limits us to Snow 's internal monologue the entire time. Unfortunately, he 's not an interesting enough of a character to be stuck with, no matter how much Hollywood has yassified him.  ---  I really enjoyed the first half of the book and looked forward to how Snow 's villain origin story would be pulled off. I was invested in his conflicted feelings about the Games and possessive affections towards his love interest - this set up a really interesting (and juicy!) dynamic, because there 's a lot of potential to create a tragic, dramatic, and poignant story there. Unfortunately, the last third of the book bumped my rating down to 3 stars, as I felt very underwhelmed by the outcome and execution. The character development was so rushed at the end; rather than a gradual and nuanced transition to \"evil\", Snow flip-flopped way too many times for arbitrary reasons. The last third of the book also became extremely heavy-handed with all the mockingjay metaphors and the constant singing to basically sum up the entire story. And if you are going to turn to the dark side so quickly and unrealistically for the sake of canon, at least give us a dramatic showdown for entertainment! This prequel really did have potential, but the last act did not stick to its landing.  7 book reviews: a lot of people are not going to like this book. it s weirder and maybe a little...goofier? than the original hunger games. it s also much more philosophical - almost part novel part contemplation on nature vs nurture and the base instincts of humanity. and it is not a villain origin story like you ve read before. if you ve come here looking for a story like the joker where you leave sympathetic to the villain and understanding what moment pushed them to being evil? well, you ll likely be very disappointed. but if you, like me, have grown frustrated with the narrative that destructive and horrible white men are just victims of society? you might love this one like i do. honestly, i think with this work suzanne is subverting and critiquing the entire narrative of the  villain origin.  house of cards could be a much better comparison to this novel than any villain origin story you ve watched or read before.  biggest complaint and what kept this from 5 stars for me: the pacing is a little off. about 75% in, the novel seems to lose a lot of it s bite and just sort of meanders (until the end, which is definitely explosive).   watch my reading vlog for the ballad of songbirds and snakes:  8 book reviews: *the perfect portrait of me, who waited for something meaningful to happen in this book till the end*   sooooooo moral of the story: Snow was just going through late confusing raunchy Puberty  all in all from the beginning I was in the    oh and using the excuse \"slow build/burn\" for a book that has poor writing and plot is getting old, boy hoooooo boy the writing was BAD Ms. Collins! the developing was BAD Ms. Collins! And SO.MANY.CHARACTERS.AND.THEIR.NAMES.MY.GOSH.     *during reading*     9 book reviews: Listen, I hate President Snow as much as the next person. But SNOW. FUCKING. LANDS. ON. TOP.  This is actually brilliant. Like genius. Critical, and scathing and thought provoking. Sprinkled with moments where your jaw just quietly drops in shock and pain but you ca not do anything except keep on reading.  This book is hypnotic. It had an unputdownable quality I am still unable to quite put my finger on. Hats off, this is how you prequel.  The only reason I took off a star was because of the rushed ending. I would have easily read 200 or 300 pages more if it meant the ending was handled as beautifully as the rest of the book was.  10 book reviews: I went into this one being VERY SKEPTICAL and for the most part I enjoyed it. I still did not really feel like we delved in too deep on how President Snow became the corrupt person he is in the hunger games trilogy, but we definitely saw a different layer to his character through this story. I found the first portion of the story to be the most engaging bit and the later half I found a bit underwhelming. In a lot of ways it felt like the story was being dragged out, but I was also still engaged with what was happening, it was just not very strong plot wise in the later half. I ca not say it really added anything to this world, but I was not mad at it to be honest. XD  11 book reviews: It won t be everyone s cup of tea, but for me it certainly was. If you re someone who knows the original books super well, then I think you ll get the most enjoyment out of it. There s so many references and nods to the original books that made me so excited! I also thought Snow s perspective was super interesting to be in and it gave us loads of information about the world of Panem. We learned so much in this book! Overall, I super enjoyed it and I flew through it because I simply couldn t stop turning the pages.  12 book reviews: *whispers softly*: fuck  *whispers louder*: this book releases tomorrow and if I see any of you posting even the mildest spoilers in your status updates you will have a safe place in hell that looks exactly like the 74th Hunger Games  *yawns*: 60% in and I ca not make myself care so I will just finish this some other time...or not   13 book reviews: Am I the only one excited to read more of Snow 's brilliantly manipulative ways and dive into his past and (hopefully) rise to power? I mean, poisonsssssss *snake hissing*  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  I have a vital, life-changing question: why does this book have 14,680 ratings when IT'S NOT EVEN OUT YET!?  it 's out so you guys can finally have an excuse for RATING BOOKS YOU HAVEN'T READ.  14 book reviews:  I think there s a natural goodness built into human beings. You know when you ve stepped across the line into evil, and it s your life s challenge to try and stay on the right side of that line.   i put off reading this book for 3 years because i was afraid i wouldn t like it. but suzanne collins never disappoints and i never should have doubted her 15 book reviews: So apparently this is about President Snow...   A teen born to privilege but searching for something more, a far cry from the man we know he will become. Here he s friendly. He s charming. For now he s a hero.   Really?  16 book reviews: When you patiently wait for this book too long and you find out this book 's plot is about: President Snow 's early times: 17 book reviews: 18 book reviews: I really really really do not care about Snow 's life. 19 book reviews: (B+) 77% | Good Notes: Awfully banal, too many names to recall, the end carries weight, but too-little-too-late, revealing but not urgent at all.  *Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:   Progress updates:  - Preamble (1) Some of you might recall that I did an audiobook re-read of \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy late last year. Well, the whole purpose of that was to prep myself for reading this book. - The problem is I forgot, lost urgency and it got lost in the shuffle. - I am sure most people here know the feeling, when you buy a book, you either read it straight away or it sits around on a shelf until you are in the mood again.  - Chapter 1 (1) I do not like that Collins uses poverty to make Snow sympathetic. - Feels cheap to me. (2) Snow 's cousin 's named Tigris. I wonder if this is the same Tigris from \"Mockingjay\"? - If so, it would give her scenes there added meaning. (3) Snow 's family is bankrupt nobility, a contrast with his school rival, Sejanus, who 's family is nouveau riche. - Such a very Victorian trope. Odd to see outside of classics.  - Chapters 2-6 (1) Dr. Gaul, the Head Gamemaker, is inclined to speak in rhyme... frequently, not all the time. - Might as well call her Dr. Seuss. (2) Familiar names keep popping up. I assume Arachne Crane is related to Seneca Crane and Hilarius Heavensbee to Plutarch Heavensbee, for example. - How very \"Harry Potter.\" (3) 100 pages in, and I am not feeling the urgency of the original books. - Sort of reads like fan fiction.  - Chapters 7-10 (1) There 's a lack of distinction among students. All the names are too alike, exotically Roman, and easily confusable. - Contrast this with \"Harry Potter,\" where student names were distinct, a bit stereotypically ethnic but distinct nonetheless, and gave an impression of appearance and voice. - I am having difficulty telling Clemensia from Lysistrata and Persephone. Make note of different hair color, at least!  - Chapters 11-13 (1) Whenever Coriolanus frets over the possibility Lucy, or Tigris, are not as chaste as he naively presumed, I hear Britney Spears singing: \"I am not so innocent!\" (2) This is turning out to be quite the Jane Austen romance. - Well, except for all the murder... and explosions... and allusions to prostitution... and ritual humiliation... did I mention murder? (3) Tigris like to eat raw meat. - A bit on the nose.  - Chapters 14-16 (1) Of course, being an Ancient Rome analogue, this society unsurprisingly has their own variation of public crucifixion. - 20' high poles with a crossbeam sounds remarkably similar to American football uprights. (2) It 's a running joke that very few people in Panem actually know the national anthem. - Possibly a commentary on indifference to national unity in the Capitol: anthems being symbolic of nationhood.  - Chapters 17-22 (1) Collins seems to only know how to write one kind of female lead. - Practically perfect in every way, who boys pine after. (2) About 60% in, and it 's a totally different book. - It could have just ended there, and the rest could be Part 2 of a duology. (3) Oh no! They are not doing what I think they are doing to link this to the main series! - No spoilers, please. (4) How very \"Game of Thrones\" Night 's Watch.  - Chapters 23-24 (1) The whole book I wondered why Lucy Gray Baird was called \"Lucy Gray\" while everyone else is referred to by their first name. Apparently, her first name is \"Lucy Gray\". - It is not a double-barreled surname, her people have double first names, with the second a common surname. - Something that could have been explained 250 pages ago! (2) The romance is going too well. I feel like tragedy 's around the corner.  - Chapters 25-28 (1) '\"Hey, you found some katniss\" ... but [Lucy Gray] immediately examined the roots, from which small tubers hung.  Little too early yet.\"' - How awfully meta. (2) Less than 50 pages from the end, and I still do not know what to think of this. - By now, books would be in tidying-up mode, but what appears to be the climax does not feel built up enough to cap off this book, it feels like the end of a second act.  - Chapter 29-Epilogue (1) Yeah, I just finished the book and I still do not know what the heck to think about it. - Whereas \"Mockingjay\" similarly required time mull over its ending, it was a much more exciting book, punctuated with action. This, on the other hand, was slow throughout and ended with a head-scratcher. (2) On the bright side, the thing I dreaded would happen because of the midpoint plot twist, did not end up happening.  20 book reviews: cackling at myself for picking this up 3 years ago and DNF ing it, and now reading it and giving it 5 stars  21 book reviews: 22 book reviews: A new BookTube Video is Up all about whether you should buy, borrow or burn 2020 YA books! Let me know what you think! The Written Review    Well, as they said, it 's not over until the mockingjay sings.  Coriolanus Snow, future president of Panem, is just eighteen-years-old in this prequel to the Hunger Games trilogy.  He is one of the Snows - a once mighty house in the Capitol but now is on the edge of desolation.  He 's desperate to preserve the image of his family and find a way to claw his way back to the top.  Then, the unthinkable happens.  Coriolanus 's graduation is now tied to the Hunger Games. He 's been given the girl from District 12 (Lucy Gray) to mentor and must find a way to bring her to the top.  Despite her being wholly and completely below him (after all, she would district)...he finds himself drawn to her and her light. But there 's darkness within Snow, a darkness that he 's willing to embrace to get what he wants. And no one - not the Capitol, not his friends, not even Lucy Gray - better stand in his way. Wow.  Guys, gals, people of all genders - wow.  I was away by this Hunger Games prequel.  So many prequels feel like completely and utterly unnecessary additions to the lore...but this one? I think it worked really well.  It added to and expanded the Hunger Games series - giving some to the origins of the Hunger Games.  It was MB to watch these cruel humans design new muttations and calmly discuss the best way to wring out emotions (and participation) from the outer districts.  I also . There 's no doubt that he 's an AWFUL being. Like completely and utterly terrible.  And yet, I was glued to him.  I never truly emphasized with him (cause, hello, he was appalling) but he was riveting to watch and provided such an interesting perspective.  There were a few loose ends that I wished were tied up in the end but overall, I really enjoyed this return to the Hunger Games - and am crossing my fingers for more!  | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  23 book reviews: Reread 2023: I decided to pick this up after watching the trailer for the film. Still really enjoyed it.  Original review: From what I have seen from early reviews, I am in the minority for this one - but I really enjoyed this. I can understand the criticism, and perhaps the argument that this is not particularly necessary, but there 's just something about this world and its set up that manages to suck me in every time.  Following Snow as a main character was always going to be a bold choice. He 's not likeable or redeeming in anyway, and I think many people will be put off by this as he 's often hard to connect with on an emotional level. He 's selfish, ambitious, proud and generally does not care about anyone unless he can get something out of having a relationship with them - whether this be power, money or advancement in society. When he becomes so taken with Lucy Grey it comes as surprise at first, until we see just how unhealthy their relationship is. His perception of love is so skewed from the norm that he believes he possesses Lucy. He owns her like an extension of his property and her success in the games can only lead to more success for him. He does not really want her to be free.  His relationship with Sejanus Plinth is another complicated edition to the story. As the son of a wealthy former District 2 entrepreneur, Snow is obviously jealous of the boy at the start of the novel. While Snow must keep up a persona of class, and uphold the Snow name while secretly wollowing in poverty, Sejanus is frequently bought his way to the top by his powerful father. But Sejanus is almost the opposite of Snow. He 's a romantic, a believer in goodness and putting the world to right. Fairness and equality. Everything the Hunger Games fights against. He 's also incredibly annoying to Snow, constantly throwing him into situations he has no intention of being involved in. But he 's the only friend he has.  I was also delighted to see the history and revisit some of the well known places of the Hunger Games. The story builds and expands on the lore well, intrinsically linking the stories together from the past. There are the ghosts of Katniss and Peeta throughout the story in the form of Lucy 's songs, the tree by the forest and the mockingjays - a creature Snow instantly hates because of their obvious subversion from the Capitol dream. It was interesting to see the backstory of the games, its purpose and development beyond dumping a bunch of children in an abandoned arena with weapons. By instilling interest into the event by involving the citizens of the Capitol and engaging the psychology behind it you encourage its continued existence and validate the violence. Especially when you combine the idea of the games with a leader who is clearly a psychopath (looking at you Dr. Gaul) by adding in mutts to kill your tributes in fun and colourful ways.  The writing has improved immeasurably too, when compared to Collins previous novels. On a base level the story is simple, yet you can delve a lot deeper into the philosophy of human nature, war and the constructs of political dominance and the effect on society. Why do the Hunger Games persist? What is their purpose and what are the consequences for the people who live in the Capitol and districts? I found it thought provoking.  I understand the complaints, but any trip into Panem is a winner for me. Coupled with an interesting, morally grey lead and machinations of power and corruption with crazy professors who mutate snakes and bunnies to kill and you are onto a winner for me.  24 book reviews: review to come  --- Its astonishing that I have managed to avoid spoilers for 3 years. All I am hoping for is that Collins does not give Snow a redemption arc. Let me hate him in peace   Pre-read theories:        25 book reviews:  Being a hero at home had its limitations; he needed a larger audience.   So,  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes  made it into the  Goodreads Choice Awards 2020  and is probably one out of 3 books I actually managed to read this year. *lol* Taking a closer look at all the reviews that have been written about it, I have no idea how it ended up as a nominee in the awards but I suppose the main reason why it made its way in there is because it s popular and provoked very conflicting emotions. I mean, all publicity is good publicity, right? ;-)  I can see why so many people didn t like it. The expectations for this were probably sky high and if you expected something similar like it s no wonder people ended up hating the book. As for me? Well, I went into this completely blind and all I knew was that it was going to be about President Snow. And tell you what?! I enjoyed it immensely! XD This book was right up my alley and the carefully hidden Dark Court faerie in me was a happy camper! ;-P (As was the part of me that loves to collect hints that are linked to the main trilogy.)  Yes, Coriolanus Snow is neither a hero nor an especially likable person but he s cunning and knows how to use his strengths. I loved all the machinations and lies, the countless manipulations and the back-stabbing attitude of the tributes as well as their mentors. It kept the story going, it forced me to take a closer look at some of Coryo s classmates and it helped me to understand Snow a little bit better. Mind you, I still hate him! *lol* But you can enjoy a book and still dislike its protagonist. ;-) So if you re looking for a slow book whose focus is on the art of schemes, I m pretty sure you ll enjoy this. If you re looking for action and a good redemption arc, well, I m sorry to say it, but you won t get it in here. This is no story in which the heroes win; it s a murky, morally grey and ambitious tale. And it ends with: ;-P           I have so many mixed feelings about this boy! On the one hand there were moments I could relate to him and on the other hand he did a lot of things I didn t agree with. To say he s a fascinating character would be the understatement of the century. Is he good? No! Is he bad? No. If anything Coryo is one hell of a multifaceted character and I ve to give Suzanne kudos for managing to make him this way. So who is Coriolanus Snow while he s the mentor of Lucy Gray Baird in the 10th Hunger Games? He s a boy driven by the will to survive! The lengths he s going to just to ensure that his family  stays on top  are kind of remarkable. I mean there s a boy who knows hunger, who has nothing but his family, a fancy apartment and his good name. War hardened him, showed him his limits and taught him that sentimentality has no bearing once you re faced with the decision to either burn your beloved books or to freeze to death. Still, while his cousin Tigris is working hard to keep food on their table, Coryo s job is to attend the academy s classes. All in the hope that he ll become big and earn them enough money to keep them afloat. That s the boy at the beginning of the book, but the longer I followed his journey, the more it became apparent that he s also an exceptional egoist and opportunist. Everything he did was calculated, every move he made was deliberate. All of his actions had an ulterior motive, even if it was as simple as not to anger Dr. Gaul. This boy is trying to survive and as long as the end justifies the means everything is allowed! The most fascinating thing for me was the fact that Coriolanus knew Dr. Gaul was trying to manipulate him into a certain direction, but that he still decided to let himself be formed by her. It was way easier than to swim against the tide and to lose everything. There were so many road junctions, so many different routes he could have taken, yet he always, ALWAYS chose the one that made life easier for him. Even if it meant to betray his friends. In the end this led to him being the perfect pawn in Dr. Gaul s game and it eventually culminated in the poisoning of Dean Highbottom. His first real and intentional murder; the very first cobblestone that paved the way for his cruel future. Well, I don t know about you, but I think Dr. Gaul won in the end!             I absolutely loved Lucy Gray Baird! She was one hell of a girl and I couldn t help but admire her for her strength. She was scared and alone, but she still refused to back down. Some might say she s a survivalist and that would be true. In contrast to Coryo she still has compassion and a good heart though. I think those two were pretty similar but what distinguished them were their different moral concepts and convictions. Coriolanus was like a wind chime always going in the direction of the least resistance without regretting (most of) his decisions while Lucy Gray had to do horrible things in order to survive and despised herself for them. She had to do those things to stay alive, but she neither enjoyed doing them nor did she accept her situation as an excuse. Quite the contrary, she didn t excuse her actions; she lived with the harsh reality of them! Maybe it was her being a part of the Covey that helped her to get through the Hunger Games. I mean she was exceptionally resourceful and she knew how to work a crowd. Both qualities that worked in her favour. And let s be honest here, the fact Coryo fell for her gave her an undeniable edge over the other tributes as well. He cared for her wellbeing, gave her food and helped her to avoid the deadly poison of the snakes. Guess Lucy Gray Baird might not only have been sassy and charming but also a little bit manipulative as well. ;-P      Dr. Gaul is one of those characters you can t help but despise. She has no regard for life, or at least not as long as it isn t useful for her purposes. This woman was ruthless and cruel, using her position in order to threaten, bully and hurt the people that got in her way. The handful of mentors she took an interest in all either ended up dead or were sent on their way to madness. For her the tributes were as much a part of the game as their mentors and she saw them all as tools. I don t know why but for some reason the picture of Tilda Swinton in  Snowpiercer  always came to my mind when I thought of Dr. Gaul. *lol*It just seemed to fit her personality and the weirdness of her character. The thing that happened with Clemensia?! Oh boy! Dr. Gaul was one hell of a manipulative witch and it s no surprise Snow turned out the way he is now after ending up under her tutelage. >_<      Sejanus Plinth was too precious for this world and that s exactly what cost him his life in the end. He was too trusting, too compassionate; he saw the tributes as people and not as animals like everyone else. Sejanus was brave but also so very innocent and naive. I think he underestimated the power, wiliness and cruelty of the people he was dealing with. On the one hand that made him braver than any of his classmates but on the other hand it also painted a target on his head. Someone like Sejanus had no place in a world like the Capitol and I think the only three people to ever realize this were his mother, Coryo and yes, unfortunately also Dr. Gaul. I think Sejanus was an idealistic dreamer and I really liked him for it. But dreaming will only get you as far and he didn t have the necessary slyness to go about things the right way. It pained me to see where his way was heading but as a reader there was nothing I could have done to stop it. Which is another reason why this book was so intriguing. It made me pull for him, but at the same time I knew he wouldn t make it.          I really think those two loved each other. The way they fell in love might have been pretty fast but considering their circumstances I think it was realistic. I mean Lucy could have died any second and Coryo s life was dangerous as well. Not to mention that they were both very young and at least for Coriolanus it was his first love. If he wouldn t have harboured real feelings for her he would have never even considered giving her his mother s compact. It was, after all, his most precious possession. This said they barely knew each other and never had the time to spend all too much time in each other s company. It s no surprise they didn t work out in the end; I ve to admit that I was sort of thrown by the events at the ending of the book though! I mean OMG!!! After everything they went through together he actually wanted to kill her... just like that?! O_o But that s Snow for you. He was always way too practical for his own good and he saw an opportunity to get the life he dreamed of. Lucy was the only obstacle left in his way so his logical conclusion was that she had to go. I m glad Lucy was so smart and figured it out before he got a chance to kill her, but I ll always wonder what happened to her. Maybe Katniss is her descendant? Who knows?      Was it friendship or not? I think everyone who read this book might have asked themselves this question at some point. I think it was and then it wasn t. The only reason Coryo saved Sejanus so often was because he would have probably died if he didn t. I mean it s not like Dr. Gaul gave him any choice in that matter. For Sejanus it was definitely friendship, he trusted Snow and considered him to be his best friend. For Coryo? I think some part of him actually cared about Sejanus, but it just wasn t enough to put his friend before himself. When faced with the choice between his or Sejanus s life Snow would have always chosen himself. And he did it in the end. He knew exactly what he did when he sent Dr. Gaul that voice record and even though he tried to reason with himself he ultimately knew that he had made the wrong choice. He knew about the consequences, no matter how hard he tried to convince himself into believing that he didn t and yet he still did it. What really struck me as tragic was that nothing would have happened if he would have let Sejanus disappear with the rebels. I mean all they planned was to run away and to seek refuge in another district. So why did he do it? An ingrained sense of duty? To curry favour with Dr. Gaul? Aside from that he had absolutely no reason to turn on his friend. So if you ask me it was some combination of stepping over his friend to get where he always wanted to be and some twisted kind of payback for all the times he got into trouble because of Sejanus. That s just my opinion though. If you have another theory: Hit me! I d love to discuss this! XD        Honestly, I was kind of impressed that Sejanus was able to defy Dr. Gaul for so long. That boy had guts to stand up to her like that and to question her in front of his entire class. Truth be told I was surprised she didn t shut him up immediately, but then again he probably was another one of her experiments. She enjoyed to be challenged by him and for a while it seemed to amuse her. Also she would have had plenty of opportunities to harm him but she chose a public execution the Hunger Games in a district that was so far off that no one even noticed. Talk about revenge. Dr. Gaul got her payback alight. >_<      Since this was Snow s story I didn t expect to be all too invested in it, but the more I read the more I was intrigued by the book. was definitely a surprise in this regard and I don t regret picking it up. Backstabbing, cruelty, machinations and complex characters, this book has it all. I can recommend it to everyone who can t help but appreciate a well-crafted and thought-provoking intrigue. ;-P  26 book reviews: 1.5 stars  I went into this cautiously optimistic because although I was not pleased that we were following Snow... I thought Suzanne would not do us dirty like that right? WRONG. She absolutely did.  My biggest complaint with this story is simply that it did not need to happen. I did not care. I did not want to know any of the information I was told in this story. Snow 's backstory does not make him more interesting or compelling. In fact, it makes him less so.  The story forces you to follow this character whose ending you already know. Even with that, he has no character arc. He does not really change throughout the story. So you are forced to read about him being awful but not realizing he 's awful for 500 pages. And while I do not think the story romanticizes him in any way, you still are forced to suffer through it. Also, the games themselves are more brutal because the Capitol has yet to figure out how to make them into the spectacle that they are in the trilogy, and I just did not need to see that brutality in fiction when I have to see it in real life in 2020.  AND HE HAS A ROMANCE! puuuuuke! A romance with a character who has very little agency and who he makes his own personal manic pixie dream girl. She would have been far more interesting to follow as a protagonist. Actually, a number of the side characters would have made much better protagonists for this story. ANY NUMBER of other stories from this world would have made a better story!  The extra .5 I gave this book was that it 's not horribly written and there are a few \"easter eggs\" for things in the original trilogy, how things got to be the way they are, etc. But I still do not care about those things and could have done without learning them.  WHY WAS THIS WRITTEN?!?  Anyway, I have a vlog of my reading experience coming up so you can see my immediate reactions.  27 book reviews: 1.) Suzanne Collins is breaking the book world today. 2.) Who is rereading The Hunger Games with me? 3.) dfklgjdlgkdhkjsflsdkf;  Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Youtube | Twitch 28 book reviews: | | blog | tumblr | ko-fi | |  It 's a yikes from me.  Did the world really need The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes? I think not.  Full of unnecessary exposition and weighed down by self-indulgent fanservice, is a train-wreck of a novel. The story lacks rhyme or reason, things happen only to advance the plot (regardless of whether they make sense because what is even logic?), there are no stakes (Coriolanus having to eat cabbage soup and not being able to pay taxes are hardly sources of tension), the characters are ridiculous and one-dimensional, frequently the writing veers into the ludicrous, and the author does not trust her readers to reach obvious conclusions by themselves.  Having recently re-read the Hunger Games trilogy, I was reminded of how good a writer Collins is. One of the strengths in THG series lies in Katniss' first person narration which brings immediacy and urgency to her story. In THG Collins' exploration of the ethics of violence and the conflict between survival and sacrifice struck me as being both nuanced and intelligent. There was also a certain ambiguity that allowed, nay encouraged, readers freedom of interpretation. Which begs the question...Collins, what happened?  may be the prequel to THG trilogy, but it 's an altogether different beast. Which would have been fine by me if it had been  wouldifferent but good'. What we have instead here are simplified discussions about human nature (are we inherently bad? Do our circumstances shape who we are ? Are we responsible for what we do in order to survive?), an unconvincing story that is dragged-out for 500+ pages and is populated by goofy characters.  The novel strives for depth, yet its attempts to address the nature/nurture question and other moral quandaries result in a clumsy and overt parable that is leagues from being a satisfying or insightful philosophical inquiry into human nature. An example of this would when Dr. Gaul assigns Coriolanus Snow and other mentors homework along the lines of:  Write me an essay on everything attractive about war.  What follows is a predictable and cringe-y scene in which they express their different opinions (shocking I know). Was that the only way to include a discussion on the  positives  of war? It seemed a desperate, and rather pathetic, attempt to throw into the story some  'serious' material. Just because the characters who are talking about these things have ancient-Roman-sounding names that does not make their conversations any more meaningful or thought-provoking. Not only does the character of Dr. Gaul exist to tick the  amad scientist' box (I will get to her in due time) but she 's also there so she can explicitly ask characters 'challenging' questions regarding their moral and political tenets. So subversive and illuminating is she that she says things such as:  Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need  and  What happened in the arena? That s humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears.  We also have characters like Sejanus Plinth who although District-born has spent the last few years in the Capital, and he comes out with:  You ve no right to starve people, to punish them for no reason. No right to take away their life and freedom. . Did this guy just suddenly realised what kind of world he lives in? After years of Hunger Games he 's like 'nah, that 's wrong. Humans should be free.' (as if he does not know that his words will have consequences?). Away with Plato. Move aside Nietzsche. Sontag? Get out of here. There is a new philosopher in town.  Corny philosophising aside, the writing was weighed down by obvious statements which made the characters seem rather simplistic. Worst still we have cheesy gems such as  you re mine and I m yours. It s written in the stars  and  although he didn t believe in it, he tried to channel her telepathically. Let me help, Lucy Gray , or witty descriptions like  The cabbage began to boil, filling the kitchen with the smell of poverty.   What in the world? I am supposed to take this seriously? The writing exudes wattpad energy.  The third person narration did not do the novel any favours. Most of Coriolanus' thoughts and feelings are not articulated so that his character is given no new depths. Collins' shies away from portraying him as a truly morally corrupt yet self-delusional person, making him into a not very convincing 'he 's not that bad' kind of guy. He 's an orphan who is tired of eating cabbage soup and not having money. Boo-hoo. His personality is just so tepid...he 's sort of ambitious, sort of a liar, a  'sort of' kind of person. Look, I was not expecting the next Ripley or Humbert Humbert but Coriolanus is such a non-entity. While the narrative makes it seem as if he 's this cunning and charming guy, Coriolanus' no Machiavelli. His elitist views are exaggeratedly rendered, so much so that they make him into a caricature of the contemptuous heir. Even those scenes in his family apartment or the ones where he 's with Tigris or Lucy Gray did not make Coriolanus any more believable or sympathetic. His 'arc' as such was merely motivated by his desire for wealth. As the descendant of a powerful yet crumbling Aristocratic family he believes he 's entitled to more than just cabbage soup for dinner. And of course, he hates Sejanus because 'new money'.  From the first chapters characters are classifies as either good or bad. Throughout the course of 500+ pages they do not change. Their thin personalities remain fixed. Because of this the cast of characters is entirely forgettable. Although their names may appear on a page, their personalities remain largely non-existent. Coriolanus' fellow students and mentors....did they even possess an individuality ? With the exception of holier than holier-than-thou Sejanus, these ill-defined Academy kids soon morphed with one another. What they say or do matters very little. They are mere accessories to Coriolanus' story (we get it, although they have been indoctrinated to believe that the Districts are scum, they are not entirely entirely desensitised to violence or cruelty). Lucy Gray was just so ridiculous. She seems one of the few random characters to have a normal name, and yet there was something comical about the way a  wouldistressed' Coriolanus would shout out her name. While the narrative did seem now and again aware that she was treated as an object, the way she s depicted seems to corroborate this. She just did not convince me as an actual human being. At times she seemed a twelve year old Marie Sue, at times she seemed to have walked off the stage of a musical, and yet we are meant to find her intriguing? The adult characters are unintentionally funny. From the  woulderanged' Dr. Gaul (who speaks only in cliches and is not at all intimidating) to Dean Highbottom (whose surname merely brought to mind Neville Longbottom) who for some reason I do not care enough about does not like Coriolanus. These two, similarly to the other characters, do not leave their assigned roles (in this case 'the mad scientist' and 'the bitter guy who for reasons holds a grudge against the protagonist'). The characters in this novel are clownish. They have wannabe-Roman names, they speak in clich s and come out with uninspired maxims.  The world-building relies on readers having read THG. Which is weird given that this is not a sequel. Panem is a dictatorship because reasons. The novel also has a weak sense of place. The Capitol is barely delineated. The Academy is a building, Coriolanus lives in an apartment, and the Hunger Games take place in an arena. The architecture of these places is obviously irrelevant. Who even cares about descriptions of the characters and their environment? (I do).   One of the first things that did not seem very rational was that the Capitol assigned the tributes to eighteen-year olds. Sure, the childhoods of these Academy students were marred by the war, but in comparison to the tributes, they have led a fairly privileged existence. But however rich their education may be, they still lack experience. They have little insight into the entertainment industry and just because they have discussed war strategies does not mean that they could give any useful battle tactics. One thing is theory, the other one is practice. Yet, we are supposed to believe that the powers that be decided that this particular group of students will mentor the tributes for the upcoming Hunger Games. The reason for this  amentorship' is to make the Hunger Games more popular, garner some extra views or I do not know. To me this seems an ill-conceived plan. Anyway, let 's go along with it: mentor=more entertaining Hunger Games. Okay, so why am I meant to believe that the same people who are working extra hard to make the Hunger Games more interesting would let the tributes starve for a few days in a zoo cage? So they can collapse and die as soon as they enter the arena? Why even bother with the mentors then?! It was quite clear that the only reason why the tributes end up in a zoo cage is to remind us readers that to the 'civilised' citizens of the Capitol, District people are less than 'animals'. There were so many scenes like this. They did not make sense but they are theatrical. Characters are attacked, killed, and or tortured for effect. For all she writes about violence and human nature, Collins' will often sacrifice believability for exaggeration. The whole thing with Dr. Gaul and her snakes was laughable. She 's such a crudely drawn figure that it was impossible to feel intimidated by her actions. The violence in this novel seems closer to that of splatter film. The Hunger Games themselves are not only boring but they are described in a yawn-inducing way. The games section reminded of how in THG films they occasionally showed the game makers watching Katniss to make up for the fact that in the book we had Katniss' narration to fill the moments of 'quiet'. There was something so impersonal about these Hunger Games that I really did not care to see the way they would unfold (we know who is going to win anyway).  Shockingly enough, I struggled to finish this novel and ended up skimming a few pages in the final section. I am baffled. What is this mess? What was it trying to achieve? It adds nothing to the THG. Coriolanus is not nuanced nor is he believable. If anything he seems a very different shade of evil to that of President Snow. We still do not know much about the war. We get it, the Capitol suffered at the hands of the  arebels'. Collins' tries to make this particular Hunger Games more significant by making characters come up with ideas that will be implemented in the following Hunger Games (like the sponsors or whatnot). For some reason Collins' has to 'foreshadow' later events or ca not help but to reference mockingjays ( the show s not over until the mockingjay sings ) and 'the hanging tree' song. What was the point in Tigris? She had a small cameo in the ...why try to make her  important ? Especially since her role in this prequel in pretty irrelevant.  With so many pages did we really need to have passages in which earlier conversations reappear in italics? Why not trust that your readers will be able to remember what Coriolanus is referring to?  Last but not least: I am so done with the  muttations'. They were the weakest aspect of THG trilogy and to dedicate so much page time to them is just...  Moral of the story: approach prequels with caution.  / / / /  29 book reviews: im so confused. was this supposed to make me like snow?? because it really didnt. can we make it a rule that if authors do a spin-off, it needs to be about a character worth reading about?  im just really not sure what the point of this is, because its definitely not a redemption story and theres hardly anything that directly ties it into the main series. i just  i dunno what to do with this.  the thing is, i had a really good time being back in panem. i also thought SCs writing has really improved since the original trilogy. i genuinely think if there had been more mentoring, more hunger games, more interaction between snow and lucy, this could have been a really interesting story to read. and its insane that im asking for more when the book is already 500 pages. so much page time is spent on unnecessary things.  i think my expectations were probably set too high for this.

Comedy gold. They loved them, they could not get enough of them. From knock knock jokes to standards this cheesy jokes will brighten up in kids day. There are over 800 jokes (get ready to listen to them all parents) and the book is separated into fun chapters and has illustrations peppered throughout. There are even funny little facts that kids will get a kick out of and longer jokes in the back that older kids will get a kick out of when they deliver the punch line. Here is a sample of some of the gems:  How can you tell a vampire has a cold? - He starts coffin.  Why did the golfer wear two pairs of pants? - In case she got a hole in one.  Kids love it - that 's enough of a review for me.  4 book reviews: Belly laughs galore!  Carole P Roman is the  go-to  person both for child readers and for authors of children s books   knowledgeable, warm, sensitive, caring and always the champion for her audience, be they readers or writers! Her extensive list of publications include her terrific  travel stories    some very fine and entertaining trips to the various countries of the world   meaningful history books, and fanciful children s stories.

This big book of jokes will tickle AND teach the art of good humor to kids...and adults. Riddles, puns, knock-knocks, and more merge thinking with laughter. A Winner!\"  Accompanied by some fine illustrations by Dylan Goldberger, the jokes flow freely and are surprisingly fresh. Example:  What time do you go to the dentist? Tooth-hurty.   How does the moon cut his hair? Eclipse it   What has 18 legs and catches flies? A baseball team  And on it goes getting better on every page turned.  Once again Carole P Roman proves she rides at the top   she just shares that joy of living that ignites kids  imaginations. Go for it!  5 book reviews: What a hoot!...  Who hasn t had a child come up to us and say:  Knock, Knock!  only to respond with some silly answer when we ask:  Who s there?  The younger the child, the louder are apt to be the peals of laughter that follow as they take in the fullness of the joke they sense they just pulled.  If Knock-Knock jocks are your and your children s (or grandchildren s) cup of tea, then you re in luck: there are a ton of them in Carole P. Roman s  The Big Book of Silly Jokes for Kids.  In fact, the book contains more than 800 jokes, including Q&A types, the aforementioned Knock, Knock jokes, Tongue Twisters, Puns (I have a friend who absolutely HATES puns; no telling what might happen now!), and Riddles. The latter are funny word puzzles that use imagination and humor to solve a problem. Here s an example of a riddle: While looking at a photograph, a man said,  Brothers and sisters have I none. That man s father is my father s son.  Who was the person in the photograph?  Give up? It was the man s son.  In short, this book is a gold mine for those who are looking for something to pass the time with their family and friends, whether it be on a casual weekend outing, on a long car trip (yes, you can do something other than stare at a movie screen or into a cell phone), or in front of the fire on a long winter night.  And to make it all the more fun and interesting, the book is laced with Silly Stats . . . things like: According to researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), this is the hardest tongue twister:  Pad kid poured curd pulled cod.  According to Guinness World Records, this is the most difficult tongue twister:  The sixth sick sheikh s sixth sheep s sick.  Which one gets your vote as the toughest tongue twister?  This is a book that everyone in the family can enjoy, especially those mischievous adolescent boys who are always trying to embarrass their parents in front of other adults at family gatherings. You know the type: the ones that will go up to your guests and ask:  What is a ghost s nose full of?  Then, when no answer is forthcoming, blurt out for everyone to hear:  Boooooo-gers!   6 book reviews: What a delightful humor collection of over 800 jokes put together by award-winning children s author, Carole P. Roman. This book of almost two hundred pages consists of seven sections: question and answer jokes, knock-knock jokes, tongue twisters, puns, riddles, wait for it stories, and your turn, a section with tips on how to tell and write your own jokes.  I received a copy of this book from the publisher and voluntarily chose to read and review with my honest opinions for no compensation. In addition to the jokes and stories, Roman sprinkles the collection with silly stats. I enjoyed these informative tidbits as much as the humor. These statistics include information on the history and cultural origins of the jokes as well as information about the nature of the subjects of the jokes. For example, I learned that in 1936, the trampoline was introduced in Central Park, New York, with a kangaroo jumping on it.  This book provides hours of fun for readers of all ages. Young children can easily master the simple question/answer jokes, while older readers will delight in memorizing the wait for it longer stories. The book would certainly be a hit at children s parties or for family entertainment around a campfire. Highly recommended and fun for all ages.  7 book reviews: This is a fun joke book! Easily arranged into \"knock knock\". . . \"riddles\". . . \"long jokes\". . . etc, it makes it easy to go back and find your favorite jokes. It also has a cute \"how to write your own jokes\" section at the end of the book. It 's a nice addition!  ----  I received this book for free but all opinions are my own. :)  8 book reviews: I ve been reading this on FaceTime with my grandson who lives in another state, then my granddaughter started listening in, also. Even if the jokes weren t so cute, it has been well worth the time spent laughing with my grandkids. Very nice little book; we ve all been enjoying it. 9 book reviews: Coming soon...visit www.cover2coverblog.blogspot.com 10 book reviews: This is a great book if you have anything to do with children. They love it and it 's great to watch their faces as they suddenly giggle. 11 book reviews:  The humor is inclusive and family-friendly with kneeslappers that kids will be bursting to tell every chance they get,  the back jacket states in Carole P. Roman s children s book, The Big Book of Silly Jokes for Kids: 800+ Jokes.  ~ What ~ This one-hundred-and-sixty-page paperback targets children ages six to twelve years old who enjoy silly and funny questions/answers, knock-knock jokes, tongue twisters, puns, riddles, and more. With no profanity or adult situations, a few cartoon drawings are added.  This back-pack sized book contains over eight-hundred jokes that are separated into six sections with a seventh chapter for writing in one s own jokes. The chapters are divided into Ha! Q&A, Knock, Knock, Tongue Twisters, Puns, Riddles, Wait for It, and Your Turn with short one-liners to paragraphed stories, included with some black and white illustrations, bolded wording, and  Silly Stats  of interesting facts.  ~ Why ~ Every kid and adult love jokes, even the typical  knock-knock  ones or corny puns. I like having books to read for our four young grandchildren when they visit, especially if they are funny or produce laughter. With these jokes been clean, they are not embarrassing or lewd while often being a play on words that have to be read not spoken to understand. I appreciate there is an ending chapter dedicated to writing in one s own designed jokes, including five tips to get started.  Here are some of the book s examples: What word is always spelled wrong in the dictionary? ~ Wrong. What did the triangle say to the circle? ~ You re pointless. Knock knock. Who s there? Ken. Ken who? Ken you come out and play with me? Can you can a can as a canner can can a can? No matter how much you push the envelope, it will still be stationery. What is the best thing you can put into a pie? ~ Your teeth. Two knives are side by side in a silverware drawer. One knife turns to the other and says,  You re looking sharp.  Silly Stat: Did you know the human tongue has eight different muscles?  ~ Why Not ~ Some of these jokes are pretty lame and contain bathroom humor. However innocuous they are, the silliness will bring joy to children. Beginner readers may have trouble understanding some of the jokes, especially if they are play-on-words. Due to the more complex jokes in the latter chapters, older children may enjoy them more than younger ones.  ~ Wish ~ Since I am not a fan of ghosts and vampires, I prefer jokes that reference them excluded from the book.  ~ Want ~ If you are looking for a joke book geared toward kids but apropos for all ages, this is a keeper.

The jokes listed inside this book are family friendly. I loved that I could read them to my 3 and 7 year old without having to worry.

    " The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma": "book reviews: The Body Keeps Score is my jam. It 's better than that. It 's like my slammajam. This is my fave book of the year so far, by a bunch.  It 's a rich treasure trove of information from the frontiers of trauma research, etiology, diagnosis and treatment. It 's changing the way I do therapy and it 's changing the way a interpret human behavior.  And to think. I almost did not read it.  When I entered the mental health field I had intended to specialize in Somatic Experiencing (SE) trauma therapy. But I quickly rejected the model when I realized it was way outside the mainstream and lacked randomized control trials (RCT) that demonstrated its effectiveness compared to other \"first line\" treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE).  I saw the author Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk lecture at the Evolution of Psychotherapy conference in 2013. He was awesome, and he really reinvigorated my interest in doing somatically oriented trauma work. But something about the experience as a whole left me feeling woozy.  Perhaps my experience was negativity impacted by the mass, prolonged exposure to the unwashed throngs of other psychotherapists (never a good thing), some of whom were from the San Francisco Bay Area (a deadly combination).  Do not get me wrong. There are lots of mental health professionals (even ones from the Bay Area) that are highly functional, sober, top notch folks.  But there are also a bunch of kooky, crazy as fuck people in the field (Particularly in the Bay Area), and there were a bunch in the crowd, and I think I was feeling a bit (or perhaps a lot) of shame for my profession. A pathological shame that was clearly a sequallia of my own dark hippy shadow.  I myself lived in the Bay Area for around a decade. I came to therapy from an unconventional \"hippyish\" background. I went to art school as an undergraduate. I have practiced yoga and meditation for over 30 years. Plus I have a couple of crappy tattoos. When I entered the field I was dreadfully afraid no one would take me seriously.  So I somewhat consciously but mostly unconsciously tried to distance myself from my own freaky roots.  I was probably still up in my head about all that when I was listening to Dr. Van Der Kolk. I was loving what he was saying, the parts I could understand any way (he speaks in a thick Dutch accent), but I also remember looking around the room and thinking \"I have to distinguish myself from these nutty hippies\".  Perhaps it was at that point I unconsciously gripped up and rejected somatic trauma work (again) in favor of the more \"masculine\" \"serious\" \"evidence based\", behaviorally oriented, here and now stuff that I currently practice.  Which, by the way, is Acceptance Comment Therapy (ACT). A mindfulness based variant of CBT which is incidentally a \"hippy as fuck\" therapeutic modality by many standards.  Anyway.  When I first saw that the book was released, I was like \"hey, that looks pretty good\" but then I had a flash back from the psychotherapy conference.  It was an intrusive mental image of a patchouli smelling, chubby middle aged hippy chick in a mauve knit poncho sweater and dream catcher earrings saying \"your fifth level is emitting too much teal energy\" and I reflexively withdrew my enthusiasm for the whole somatically oriented trauma treatment program.  Anyway. I did eventually get over myself (and my hippy phobia) and got the book and man is it good. It 's extremely, extremely triple extremely good. It 's like, organically, cosmically, spin your chakras at a dead show good.  And despite Dr. Van Der Kolk 's activist agenda, he 's actually a pretty reputable (Harvard affiliated) scientist and clinician and widely regarded as one the the worlds foremost authorities on trauma and trauma sequelae (yes I used the term seguelae twice in the same review, actually three times if you count the time I just used sequallia in this parentheses, oops, better make that four).  And, yes, Dr. Van Der Kolk also apparently does yoga and meditation and has probably smoked tons of weed and hung out at Eslen. But I am willing to forgive the man for that because I too have been guilty of similar behavior in my woolly headed, not so distant past.  Before I became a therapist, I was on my own journey to recovery from addiction, trauma, depression, anxiety etc.  BTW: when I hear other therapist start talking about their recovery, I cringe. Please forgive me if you are feeling cringy. But sometimes we all have to go there in order to communicate certain important points.  Anyway.  The foundation of my recovery was self-care. For me, self-care was (and still is) founded on basics such as: healthy sleep, exercise and nutrition. It also included good therapy and a little 12-step. But the rocket fuel of my recovery was yoga, loving kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation.  Now, one of my primary intentions as a therapist is to assist my clients in developing self compassion and embodied mindfulness skills for utilization in their recovery.  While the secular mindfulness revolution thing that has been happening over the past two decades has normalized mindfulness and provided ample scientific evidence for the clinical use value of mindfulness training e.g. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  And mindfulness-based psychotherapeutic modalities such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) have provided evidence-based mindfulness integrated psychotherapeutic frameworks.  The evidence for somatically oriented (embodied) therapeutic modalities has lagged. Dr. Van Der Kolk 's work is providing this evidence and is blazing the trail for mainstream acceptance of somatically oriented practices.  Dr. Van Der Kolk 's work is also foundational for changing the way the field conceptualizes and diagnoses trauma.  Additionally Dr. Van Der Kolk is lending legitimacy to some cutting-edge and very exciting trauma treatments such as Neural Feedback and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).  I, like millions of other people, have suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. In early recovery I received lots of good therapy for trauma and I am happy to report that I am no longer impaired by PTSD symptoms.  Out of all of the therapy I received, anecdotally speaking, I have to say, some of the most effective was EMDR. I had phenomenal results from an equally phenomenally brief treatment time (two, one hour sessions).  This is standard EMDR testimonial. People very commonly report that it works and it works fast.  Again, as a nascent therapist in training, I had intended to train in EMDR. But EMDR is like the dirty redheaded stepchild of psychotherapy. Despite ample evidence of its efficacy, nobody can figure out why it works, so the model has been widely rejected by the mainstream mental health community.  I sort of drank the Kool-Aid and jumped on the anti EMDR bandwagon. But after reading this book, I am feeling very enthusiastic about treating trauma with EMDR.  I could go on and on, but I would rather just urge you to do yourself a big favor and read this book.  1 book reviews: This book represents everything that is groundbreakingly wonderful and and pseudoscientifically horrendous about trauma research. Individuals who suffer trauma are in need of actual help. This book contains some of the best, latest, and most effective cures for trauma sufferers, which can steer patients toward the help they need. However, van der Kolk seems wholly unable to engage in critical thinking when it comes to various treatments.  When attending courses in cognitive neuroscience and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, my favorite professors were those who ripped apart each treatment to examine it for efficacy. The profs held out hope that cures were attainable but put them under the microscope to make damn sure the \"cure\" would not actually retraumatize and individual or make matters worse. In order to trust a mental health care provider, that provider should demonstrate not only a knowledge of the literature (as van der Kolk does as he repeatedly throws around his MD and Harvard alma marter to assure his reader of his credentials) but also an ability to sort out fact from fiction. van der Kolk seems entirely enamored with outdated findings (that have since been shown to be incorrect) and therapies that have failed to be backed up by empirical support. Most concerning, he seems completely in denial about how easily false memories form and the damage they can do.  On a more positive note, he does a great job championing individuals who are often rejected by the field of psychiatry. Since false memories are real, and they have wreaked havoc on an already traumatized person 's fragile life, many aspects that lead to remembering repressed memories have come under fire. This has served to invalidate the real and true experiences suffered by many people during their childhoods and beyond. Under particular scrutiny is dissociation, something that can be particularly difficult for survivors to deal with, is treated as if it does not exist. This is certainly a problem and I do not know how to find a middle ground between dissociation deniers and false memory/ personality creating therapists, but I would venture to say that van der Kolk 's approach is not it. There has got to be a better way to validate the real, and sometimes repressed traumas while, at the same time, not creating new ones by promoting fictitious experiences that do not exist.  Additionally, there is a lot of study involving a person 's perception that never made it into this book. I understand that, again, it is difficult to take on the effects of perception while simultaneously trying to validate what really happened to people. But, perception can really affect mental health and subsequent behavior. Not only that, there is a very real phenomenon in which excused behavior can cause the trauma sufferer to continue to delve out trauma to others. While van der Kolk mildly touched on this at times, he did not do so in any in depth of concrete manner.  This book could have been half as long and, if van der Kolk had stuck to only empirically sound findings and treatments, could have been a great book. Associating words with Harvard and MD does not make them true. It just makes people believe them more. Sometimes that is more harmful than helpful.  Despite the foregoing criticisms, this book, with its many chapters on various treatments, might help trauma sufferers seek a treatment that seems right for them.  2 book reviews: As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women were not as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely if ever do not finish a book, but I am shelving this one.  3 book reviews: Am I supposed to feel bad for Tom? I do not. He reports that he murdered a farmer, children, and raped a woman in a village in Vietnam to \"cope\" with the loss of his platoon. I do not understand why he was never criminally charged for this? Being traumatized does not give you free reign to do whatever you want. The author even seems to blow it off by saying something like, \"I understand why this happened. Men have been getting revenge like this since Homer 's time\".  Now, Tom is actually parading around as a lawyer in the United States. I guess if you kill and rape in another country it gets forgiven? Are their lives worth less than American lives?  The author even brings up a certain case Tom got very excited about being involved in; finally \"felt alive\". He was defending a murderer, and he won. I am not sure how the author missed the fact that in Tom 's brain he was actually defending himself in a desperate attempt to justify his actions in Vietnam. I am also not sure how the author seems to miss the fact that he seems to be empathizing with a very problematic, asshole, rapist, homicidal combat veteran in an attempt to become closer to his own father 's memory.  Hardly a mention of Tom 's wife, who is seemingly unawares that she is married to a man who committed these atrocities. There is not a serious consideration for the safety of her or their children, despite the fact that Tom is \"prone to violent outbursts\".  I am quite upset over this portion of the book and the lack of empathy shown by the author towards Tom 's victims. He even mentions Tom and his friend chasing around \"Vietnamese bar girls\" in a weird \"boys will be boys\" way, blatantly ignoring the trauma that led those women to that situation to begin with. Oh, and again the fact that Tom had a significant other at home during that \"good fun\".  This is not worth my time to finish. It borders on misogyny and is very tone deaf. I am actually pretty disgusted by it. People like Tom are the main cause of all of this bullshit in the first place.  Shelving.  4 book reviews: A lot of women and non-binary folks read this book, so I want to say this:  This book was written by a white man who hurt women (and who knows who else) and is simply regurgitating the wisdom of Black women and women of color who have not only been through the trauma he speaks of, but who also have been saying these things and operating in trauma healing far before this yahoo put his stolen thoughts down.  Knowing the reason folks are most likely reading this book and how he made people feel violated in chauvinistic ways is more disturbing than the heavy contents itself.  UPDATE: in replacement, I HIGHLY SUGGEST  Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto  by Tricia Hersey,  What My Bone s Know  by Stephanie Foo, The Body Is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor plus the accompanying work book, and Who is Wellness For by Fariha R is n (I also have a shelf that I am constantly adding books to in case you need more!)  5 book reviews: A compassionate, intelligent, and transformative book about trauma. As an aspiring clinical psychologist and writer, I look up to Bessel van der Kolk a lot. In The Body Keeps the Score, he infuses empirical, innovative research with hands-on clinical experience to explain trauma in a clear, authentic way. I loved his emphasis on incorporating both biology and social relationships into our understanding of trauma, as awful events affect both the body as well as the actual life of a struggling individual. He clarifies many misconceptions by stressing how many victims of child abuse often go ignored when compared to war veterans, and he argues with much logic that we cannot just use drugs to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental illnesses. We must treat the whole person.  Dr. van der Kolk steers this book in a hopeful direction by discussing many treatment strategies for PTSD. He includes descriptions and research studies to support a gamut of methodologies, ranging from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to Eye Movement Desensitization Therapy (EMDR) to Neurofeedback, and more. In particular I enjoyed reading about the Internal Family System approach (IFS), a mode of psychotherapy I had never heard of, which I found enlightening and holistic. Dr. van der Kolk emphasizes the importance of getting back in touch with our emotions and our bodies after trauma, and he gives many practical ways to do so, like talk therapy and yoga, just to name a few.  Dr. van der Kolk 's genuine heart elevates this book above others. His vulnerability with his own story models a message for all of us to live by: only by confronting and accepting the past can we learn to live in the present. He writes about the importance of de-stigmatizing PTSD and mental illness, and he relates the issue of trauma to several societal factors, like the prolific amount of gun violence in the United States and the lack of socioemotional education given to our kids. Dr. van der Kolk, with great humility and insight, details his admiration for each of his clients - because they have overcome such devastating hardship, and they have had the courage to share their stories with him, and in some cases, others as well.  A stellar book I would recommend to anyone interested in trauma, mental health, or science in general. I noted so many well-written passages and cannot wait to reference this book in the future. I hope more people read - it would improve our society a lot.  6 book reviews: As someone who suffers from chronic pain I ve found it difficult to find resources about the connection between trauma + physical pain. This is because the mind-body connection are (I think intentionally) underdeveloped in Western medicine which so often rehearses the body outside of context.  Van der Kolk shows how trauma can shape every aspect of our psychology + physiology: making us attracted to dangerous/painful situations, affecting our perception of time + space, dispossessing us of the ability to describe our discomfort, causing chronic muscle pain, headaches, + autoimmune disorders. We live in a world that constantly underemphasizes the emotional trauma even though the same parts of the brain are impacted by emotional pain as by physical violence. Heartbreak, betrayal, neglect, depression physically hurt. This continual undervaluation of emotional stress means that it accumulates, depletes significant energy + attacks our most vulnerable organs.Van der Kolk describes chronic pain as when your brain gets trapped in a pre-programmed escape route, stuck in perpetual fear. For him, the goal is about how to develop coping strategies for trauma that don t retraumatize us: reintegration, not repression. Healing is possible when we commit to this reintegration. Talk therapy isn t enough: we can t just describe the problem, we have to experience  immobilization without fear.   As a doctor, his book has a clinical bent + outlines various strategies like EMDR + biofeedback which help break trauma cycles. I wish that there had been more discussion of people who have complex trauma where there is no  before  or  after  to the traumatic event. I m thinking here about how racism + transphobia are continual forms of trauma that we can t move out of. There was so much important info in the book, but I was kind of turned off by the clinical language where complex people became case studies and cultural rituals became Western mindfulness practices without appreciation for context.  As a survivor of abuse this book can be difficult to get through, so serious content warning.  7 book reviews: Gave up. The author 's description of his (psychiatric, traumatized) women patients as \"slender\" and \"gorgeous\" is so annoying. (ETA: Especially considering that he is writing in the same breath about rape and incest survivors.) 8 book reviews: This is a remarkable book. There are a lot of people I would recommend this book to, but it is about trauma and so the author discusses trauma and describes traumatic events   and the more I thought about who I might recommend it to, the less I felt able to. I m not sure I really can  recommend  you read this   but then, I might be more squeamish than other people are with books on these topics. And dear god, there are people out there who do the most awful things to one another.  In one of Steven Pinker s books I read years ago   either the Blank Slate or How the Mind Works   he says that father-daughter incest is incredibly rare, in fact, virtually unheard of   like most things he says, he said this with utter conviction and, like most things he seems to say outside of linguistics, he was completely and even dangerously wrong.  Like I ve said, a lot of this book makes for unbearable reading. That said, I would still encourage you to read it if you can bring yourself to. Now, I m not saying that for the normal bullshit reason people say such things   you know, because it gives you an insight into the dark side of the human condition (if you want that, you could just turn on the news), or that it is so inspiring to see people overcome near infinite aversity (I guess it must be, but there are better ways to be inspired), but I would suggest reading it because I think our world is becoming an increasingly traumatic place. I m certainly not saying that modern life is the same as being raped by your drunken father while you are still in primary school, but I do think that modern life presents us with a sense of powerlessness, of disassociation, of an overwhelming sense of loathing for what we are forced to do in our day-after-day jobs and that all this can be (no, actually, IS) a source of mental trauma to far too many of us. If the trauma discussed here often happens with a bang, I think the slow drip, drip, drip of horror of a lot of modern life can have much the same accumulative impact. Couple that with the abject precariousness with which we hold our jobs, even while they cripple our sense of self-worth, and really, you get one of those perfect storms people seem to like to talk about   you know, lots of bad things and all of them happening at the same time.  I am a very strong believer in the power of narrative   we are not just  pattern making creatures  but rather we are  story making creatures . All the same, this isn t always a good thing. The story Hitler told of German humiliation after WWI, of the power of world Jewry to cripple the German nation out of spite, of the Jewish link to Bolshevisms, and this and so much more, left us with a decade drowned in blood. My belief in the power of stories has always made me fond of the psychological  talking cure    well, fond for other people, if not so much for myself. I ve always believed that if we can find ways to  rewrite  our stories we gain power over our life. This book makes it clear that in cases of real and deep trauma this isn t always possible, in fact, it is counter-productive at best.  The author explains that when we experience deeply traumatic events our brains  cope  by shutting down those parts of the brain that are not immediately necessary for us to come out the other end of the event alive. The part of the brain that gets shut down that is most interesting in relation to post-traumatic stress is the bit that locates the event in time. (That part of the brain has a name, I m never interested enough to remember those names   the book gives you all those names and maybe even more). I guess the brain figures that all times are one time if you it isn t clear you are going to live through an event. The problem is that this means that the event then isn t really connected to any specific time   and so it can never be  over    it is  ever-present . That is, any trigger that brings the event back to mind doesn t just remind you of the event   it puts you back into the immediacy of the event. You don t just  remember  the event   you are back living it. And this is why talking cures don t work so well with trauma   if memory is like groves implanted on our brain, reliving events in all of their immediacy over and over again, as if these events are constantly in the present, turns those groves into canyons.  A lot of post-modern theory is interested in how our bodies embody who we are. A case in point is gender   what it means to become male and female is highly dependent on the culture you are brought up in. In pre-revolutionary China certain women had their feet bound since this was considered the height of feminine beauty   but you don t need to physically bound parts of people s bodies to embody social attitudes within them. The wearing of high heels comes to mind, of course, but I m also thinking of the  man spread  people complain about on trains   and yet, you never hear the same complaint about women. And why? Because women are taught to make themselves small throughout their lives in our culture and this eventually becomes so embodied within their identity as to be unnoticed by them or anyone else   well, unless they break the rule, take up more space than is allocated to them, and then everyone notices.  A large part of the point of this book is to show how trauma marks our bodies in ways we may not notice as being related to the trauma and that these marks, these embodied scars, while designed to  protect  us, can often have the effect of prolonging and accentuating the scars the trauma has left.  As such, a lot of this book, at least the bits that consider at how to overcome trauma, look much less at what drugs you should take to make the symptoms disappear, but rather what can you do physically to control the effects of your trauma. The author practices EMDR   Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing   which, is something my daughter has been doing, and something I would have dismissed a few years ago as nonsense. As I said above, the point of much of trauma therapy is to convince your brain that the traumatic event is now in the past. It is pretty difficult to rewrite your story if the story seems to be happening right now and you are about to die. So, finding a way to think about that story and to also feel safe is pretty important. The author suggests that EMDR is one of the ways to achieve that   well, and patience too. He also has an entire chapter on yoga. He stresses the importance of becoming aware of one s own body, and not just in the sense of noticing when you are hyperventilating or your heart is jumping out of your chest   although, these are good things to notice too   but also where memories feel like they are stored in your body. You know, where it is uncomfortable to be touched or, in yoga, which positions make you feel vulnerable and why that might be.  He also talks about the power of writing   I really do believe in this, like I ve said already, I believe in stories. I really think that most of us miss the point of writing, that it is a way for us to see what we think, quite literally, and that we do not use this power nearly often enough. But, again, this comes back to my belief in the power of narrative, and perhaps it is just me.  Like I said at the beginning   it is hard to know if I can recommend this book, but it is fascinating stuff.  And Benjamin Rogers   thanks for recommending this to me, I m very grateful.  9 book reviews: I am not a psychologist, psychiatrist, doctor, social worker or otherwise involved in treatment or research of mental conditions or disorders. What I am is a guy in his mid-twenties who experienced multiple instances of severe medical trauma as a child, in my case open-heart surgeries at the ages of three months, six years and eleven years.  I have spent the majority of my life (read: all of it) doing my best to repress and resist the terror, anger and sadness I felt as a result of having gone through these procedures. And I was able to get by, mostly, though my life always seemed to be a highly fragile construct, where I worked tirelessly to maintain control.  I lost control this year, or maybe part of myself decided it was time to let go of my controlling behaviors and coping mechanisms, which no longer serve to help me, but instead negatively affect the quality of my life. This was a very tough realization, and my default response was to beat up myself for behaving 'wrong' or otherwise being 'a failure' for the way I had been just trying to get by.  That 's why this book has been so important for me, because I now realize that the way I have been living is not bad or wrong--I have been trying to survive, to get to a place where I can truly feel safe, validated and connected to others. But my body does not know how to let down, to let go. Much as Dr. van der Kolk points out throughout this book, I am stuck in these moments of past horror, faced with autonomic imbalances that keep me on the defensive 24/7. And I do not know how to stop.  This book has already proven to be a crucial resource, as it sheds light on much of what I have been struggling with my whole life, showing that there are people out there who really understand. Just as important, it shows me that there is help available. It took me over three months to read this book, because part of me hated that I could identify with so much of what the author describes when discussing the nature of trauma. Oftentimes it just made me profoundly sad. Some of the experiences shared within are also quite harrowing. Usually I could not get through a chapter without breaking down. But I kept coming back to it, because I knew it was within my power to help and educate myself.  Thank you, Dr. van der Kolk, for helping me take this step towards healing myself, past and present. I hope to look back on this period one day and recognize how much reading this book helped me to start down the path to recovery, presence of mind and body, and fully engaging with life.  10 book reviews: This book was super okay. I think the title should be changed to, \"PTSD for Treatment Professionals: An academic and anecdotal exploration of trauma treatments.\" So, that was not what I signed up for. I will say, if you have PTSD, probably do not read this book because it has these very graphic descriptions of patient trauma experiences. I think therapists are the target audience for this book, and it provides an interesting overview of the treatment modalities available for PTSD and the research about them.  One thing I will say about all of the PTSD books I have read lately is that people HATE the DSM. I kind of get it, and I can see how it fucks everything up, especially with kids, but also I kind of think the rage should be turned more to the insurance industry than the DSM. Like the DSM seems more like a symptom of the overall problem where we are more into classifying people than helping them.  My other takeaway is that Bessel A. van der Kolk is super badass. He is one of the early researchers on PTSD, and he describes working in the old mental hospitals and seeing people sprayed down with hoses to clean them. So, that 's an example of the type of story he tells that made this book a slow read for me. I will say, I listen to people 's trauma stories all day long, but the stories he told in this book were really heavy to me. I had to take a lot of breaks.  In the chapter on EMDR, he talks about his EMDR training. He was in a group training class and was partnered with a person who did not want to talk about his trauma experience during the EMDR. (In EMDR, the way van der Kolk did it, you basically wave your fingers in front of someone 's face as they re-experience a trauma memory, and the eye movements process the trauma memory into the regular stream of memory in the brain. It 's super magic and also evidence-based.) Van der Kolk was mad that the person did not want to talk and complained to the instructor. The instructor told him to question whether there was a voyeuristic element to why he became a therapist.  So, that seemed like an insightful perspective, and I thought it made sense with this book. A lot of the stories he told had a voyeuristic element to them in my view. I do not really feel critical about that, but I did not enjoy that aspect of the book.  I appreciated the overview of trauma treatments, though. So far, from everything I have read somatic experiencing and EMDR are the ones I am most impressed with.  11 book reviews: I got to page 13 after a Vietnam war vet disclosed horrific crimes he had committed with seemingly no author acknowledgement towards the victims and the individual seeming to never have to face any consequences for his actions (still a practicing lawyer??!??!) despite disclosing this.  Other commenters note this and add that there are many voyeuristic description of female victim survivors experiences  I am done with non fiction male narrators taking an \"objective neutral stance\" in situations like this  Not the book for me!  12 book reviews: This book has received much praise and also disappointed many readers. I now understand why. If you plan to read this book, you need to understand it 's two basic characteristics: 1) it 's POP-SCIENCE and 2) it 's TRAUMATIZING.  Let 's tackle the first point. Pop-science is not science. People who write pop-science are rock stars with a degree. Most of them are administrators who spend most of their time on the lecture circuit, writing books, attending conferences, and managing a host of grant writers, practitioners, medical staff, public relations experts, middle managers, and financial officers. Their days of actually practicing their art has long gone, but they still will occasionally see the odd patient here and there to keep their feet wet, their privileges relevant, and to demonstrate their medical genius.  How do I know this? I have been practicing psychiatry for two decades and have worked with and met my share of famous pop-practitioners in my various roles as a medical provider, chief medical officer, State government policy-maker, public speaker, and chief executive officer. Dr. van der Kolk is one of those rockstars and thought leaders.  And it is thanks to people like him that we have a society that has been moving at all to trauma-informed care, and to understanding the neurology behind anxiety and disorders impacted by or caused by trauma. And it is thanks to books like this that the known science is explained in a way that is accessible to people who have not lived their whole lives speaking the lingo. This book was designed to turn on light bulbs, to inspire, and to reduce stigma. One of the greatest things I can ever do for a patient is to DEMYSTIFY their experience. When people realize that their experiences are not due to moral failings, or to being weak-willed, or because they are \"crazy,\" when it all ceases to be magic and now they can define it and hold it in their hands, then they have a challenge with solutions rather than a stigma to hide from others and themselves.  But this then leads to the weaknesses of books like this. Pop-science has to balance rigorous academic standards with making a product that is easily understandable and sensational enough to sell to a wide audience. So the science will not all be fully explained or referenced. And what science there is may be flawed by the basic issue that there just are not the same standards applied to a self-help book as to a scientific journal article. So Dr. van der Kolk can ramble on about how what a mensch he is, and tell sensational details about his experiences with patients, and take some liberties with the verifiability and consistency of his outcomes.  Therefore, do NOT think this is the book that will change your life with secrets no one but the chosen few have known till now. And do NOT read this book with the idea that you will be able to debunk scientifically everything the author is saying and prove he is a fraud. And do NOT read this book if you are easily triggered.  Regarding my later warning, know that this book goes into some explicit details regarding traumatic events. Some may hit a little too close to home. And this leads to my main criticism of van der Kolk 's work--I do not think he takes into account enough the potential to RE-TRAUMATIZE.  I think an important take-away should be that your brain is designed to protect you from danger, and one of the ways it does this is by erring on the side of being hyper-alert. All humans are designed this way. If you were to hear a rustle in the bushes, it 's best to assume it 's a lion and not a rabbit. Because what if it is a rabbit? No harm is done if you run from a noise when it was only caused by a little bunny. But if you were to make the opposite error and assume the rustle is something harmless and it 's really a hungry carnivore, well you may just get removed from the gene pool. So we are all primed this way. But what if at some point in your life everything proves to be a lion? And no matter what you know to do to avoid the danger, nothing works to protect you or someone next to you?  Now that is when your brain essentially short circuits the traumatic memory. Merciful to say the least. But your brain is also responsible for keeping you from getting hurt again. If you burn your hand on a hot stove, you will rightfully feel anxiety near a hot stove. This is protective. But with PTSD, now you have a situation where your anxiety is not necessarily paired with a conscious cognition. Fear, panic, defensiveness, aggression, may seem to come out of nowhere.  So where this book fails to tread lightly is in the emphasis on verbalizing the traumatic event, the idea being that making those cognitive connections gives the traumatized person more control and the therapist more access to working through cognitive distortions that are no longer helpful in protecting the person. This overemphasis tends to lead to some gratuitous sharing by patients, which then gets gratuitously shared in this book, and then we get to vicariously read about these experiences.  And here 's the clincher--the book did not need to go there. People can and do get better without having to wallow in their story by telling it over and over again. Sometimes there is no way to even know if the story you get from this practice is accurate, because our minds naturally confabulate and fill in gaps of memory. This book should have discussed the danger of therapists accidentally contributing to false memories and retraumatizing someone. It should have focused more on grasping the here and now, no matter what the past story. In Chapter 6, he does mention the importance of physical self-awareness as essential for fully experiencing the present, and my own clinical experience finds this to be absolutely spot on. It is not avoidance. Accepting that something awful has happened and then helping that person develop more effective ways of interacting with a world that is, in fact, not completely filled with nothing but hot stoves and lions--that 's what this book is ultimately all about. Therefore, all the patient anecdotes were unnecessary in my opinion.  So that is why I give this book a middling review. I do recommend it, but proceed with caution.  13 book reviews: Nearly finished. Couldn t deal with his voyeuristic description of specific traumatic events. It came across as self-inflating. It s almost as though it gave him pleasure to share how others confided their traumas to him. Not a great book if you re easily triggered by descriptions of sexual abuse (sometimes unnecessary graphic). 14 book reviews: DNF @ 75%.  I wo not give a rating to The Body Keeps the Score since I am setting it aside with no intention of picking it back up. My expectation was that it would provide insightful tools to help deal with my own chronic neck and back pain, but it reads like a psychology textbook. As I fortunately have not suffered the severe PTSD-causing trauma of focus in the book, not much is applicable in that regard. Even viewing it from the lens of a psychology memoir, it did not hold my interest. There I would refer readers to the superb and superior Good Morning, Monster by Catherine Gildiner.  AND I really did not enjoy reading about the various trauma/abuse tests done on animals... including dogs!!!  Not for me.  15 book reviews: actual rating: 3.5 stars 16 book reviews: This book is...okay. My problems with it: Way too long, van der Kolk is long-winded and draws attention to himself, his insights, his compassion, his associations with too much regularity. The book would be a third shorter without his ego included. Could be an academic text but not really. van der Kolk ca not seem to make up his mind if he wants to provide us with the most up-to-date trauma research or a folksy case study journal. Made for tedious writing. He describes some rape and incest victims as \"gorgeous\". Gag me. Being a trauma victim does not excuse inflicting trauma on others. In the first PTSD case he describes (a Vietnam Vet whose unit was killed in a rice paddy), \"Tom\", he positions Tom as someone haunted by his friends' deaths. After the rice paddy incident, Tom goes out and kills a child, rapes a woman, you know war crimes, and what van der Kolk offers is, \"maybe the worst of Tom 's symptoms was that he felt emotionally numb.\" Well, no. That is not the worst of his symptoms. Well, maybe getting away with rape and murder is the worst of his symptoms. But van der Kolk continues to somehow excuse the traumatized by saying that they feel shame \"about the way they behaved during a traumatic episode, whether it is objectively warranted or not.\" EXCUSE ME? Shame over the commission of atrocities is not objectively warranted???? They feel shame? Enough shame to present yourself to an International War Crimes Tribunal? Guess not. Again, gag me.  Having said all of that, it is, overall, a necessary and important subject highlighting how trauma alters us physiologically and that treatment has to include a re-mapping of the brain and body. That seems like a pretty straight-forward case to be made. Unfortunately, Bessel van der Kolk somehow seems to muddy the waters here. This book shows up as an over-wrought, an over-long, missed opportunity.  17 book reviews: fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck 18 book reviews: Audiobook.... read by the author: Dr. Bessel van der Kolk.  Kolk is one of the world s experts on trauma. He spent three decades working with survivors.  This book is packed filled with science, research, experience, and human stories that are phenomenally informative and intense!!!!  Kolk exposes how trauma physically affects changes in the brain and body causing anxiety, rage, depression, the inability to concentrate, problems remembering, flashbacks, trusting, and forming relationships.  He examines trauma caused by childhood neglect, abandonment, sexual or domestic abuse, and war.  ....We learn lessons from Vietnam veterans. ....We get a better understanding how the brain works. How PTSD plays out. ....He explains the body-mind connections: losing your body: losing yourself. ....He takes us into the minds of children, and adults - showing how trauma develops over time -turning into PTSD.  We get a grand overview of the  historical development  -academically & intimately - associated with understanding mental health science. I found this book literally fascinating, important, engaging, and helpful.  We get a wide glimpse of how doctors have been educated. (with real life examples of doctor/patient connections),  The stories were incredibly gripping and compelling..... integrating medical and psychological practices.... ....mixing traditional talk therapy, medications ( many different ones were explore of their effectiveness), new treatments, and alternative therapies such as mindfulness, meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, boxing, tai chi, walking, kick boxing, etc. were also explored.  Towards the end of the book Dr. Kolk outlines healing paths to recovery - letting go of the past and rewiring the brain. How to choose a doctor - etc.  I can t express enough how informative and gripping/informative these real life stories exposes. And how sadly PTSD is passed on to our children.  Dr. Kolk shared with us patients trauma....( he s an amazing advocate for finding solutions) > real healing treatments, beyond medications, ....and ongoing life healing. We see why it s vital to get help!!! Old traumas get stuck in the brain - it takes gentle safe work to unlock them... in order to experience real joy in the present.  I came away with a  deeper  and  expanded  understanding of the body/mind connection in relationship to trauma.  I also came away with remarkable compassion/admiration - respect - and dignity for people who have dedicated their lives in the field of mental health... and for all those who suffer.  This is an extremely comprehensive book exploring PTSD...(havoc on the brain and body).  Highly recommended to educators, parents, and the rest of us! Paul & I both found this book exceptional! One of the most valuable Audiobooks I ve ever bought!     19 book reviews: Disappointing. I so looked forward to this book from Goodreads. I found it to be disconnected and disorganized, covering so many different aspects of trauma that it dealt with none of them well. The disjunctive aspect of placing Vietnam vet PTSD along with survivors of childhood abuse was confusing. Language used was at times that of a professor, at times that of a thesis, and at others of a non professional. van der Kolk 's debate with DSM V was also unnecessary to the book. A great deal of footnotes were listed, however in many areas footnotes were necessary to support statements and were not there. Case studies, neuropsychology experiments on rats are not valid supporting evidence of corresponding brain function in humans nor of the \"curative \" aspects of EMDR. I find it difficult to recommend this book to any particular \"audience\" or reader  20 book reviews: In the space of two weeks, two people recommended this book to me. A fascinating look at the body and trauma, very wide-ranging. 21 book reviews: This book took me more than a year to work through, and I m glad I took my time with it. The sheer number of flags on these pages will tell you how meaningful this one was for me... as a rape and sexual abuse survivor who is still battling the long term effects of PTSD, this one hit home so hard.  It gave me hope, it helped me understand deeper levels to what I ve lived/am living through, it taught me so much about how the body holds pain and past experiences, it broke my heart as I read of stories similar and different to mine, it reminded me again and again how important therapy and EMDR and psychiatry are for healing...  (also hear me say: I am a Christian who fully believes in the power of prayer, and I also see a psychiatrist and take a daily antidepressant and have additional anxiety meds for when triggers cause panic attacks, I see a Christian counselor every single week, I have gone through EMDR, I have trusted friends and loved ones supporting me daily, and ALL of these things are helpful tools in my arsenal as I work to heal and be healthy.)  This powerful book is not for the faint of heart, and it s not really an easy read, but wow, I am so incredibly thankful for all of the research and wisdom and stories that went into this important and needed work.  I feel seen, heard, understood, known, and most beautifully, hopeful.  22 book reviews: Dr. van der Kolk 's study of trauma treatment is the most respected book lately published on the subject of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Following in the footsteps of Babette Rothschild and Peter Levine, van der Kolk takes as his focus the physical aspects of psychological injury - suggesting that work with the body is the clearest and most effective approach to healing. He is not a fan of the pharmacological. Drugs, while useful in tamping down the flood of fearsome emotional response, do little more than re-establish a basic level of functioning. In his view, medications cannot be considered treatment as they do not lead to a resolution of the condition. Over thirty years of research and clinical practice have led him to alternative methods of care that have shown to produce real results in the lives of those too often relegated to prescriptive numbing and symptom management.  After a bit of a muddled start (that trigger the vulnerable reader), the doctor locates his footing and begins a guided tour through a series of body-based programs designed to address the fundamental conflict underlying PTSD. Those familiar with trauma are well aware of the sense of being caught in the maelstrom of a past catastrophe and unable to break free. The surreptitious assault of flashback, the tactile immediacy of phantom danger, and the brutal jolt into a fight/flight/freeze posture leaves the psyche in a constant state of high alert as energy levels drop to depletion. Dr. van der Kolk traces the body-brain connection and walks the injury through several alternative treatments - among them EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), yoga, IFS (internal family systems therapy - which has nothing to do with families and everything to do with creating a whole of the many different internal parts of a person), psychomotor therapy, neurofeedback, and even theater work. These are the money chapters, and where a substantial amount of hope resides. Merely becoming familiar with the methods may, in fact, set some wheels to turn...and that is helpful.  Dr. van der Kolk is not a writer, but then few in this field throw their skills in a literary direction. What is important to them is what will help you. This book holds that aim as its sole preoccupation. And all I have to say about that is...bravo.  23 book reviews: What fascinates me about trauma is what it does to you. It helps you survive whatever has tried to hurt you. It s a survival instinct.  When you experience trauma your brain protects you, it literally creates a new personality on top of the one you were born with and transforms you. It increases your senses, it makes you more intelligent, but it changes your brain chemistry and that 's the big problem. If your chemistry changes then you are not going to benefit in normal everyday situations because your flight, fight and freeze part of your brain is now on over drive, your hypothalamus is now stuck in hyper drive and your prefrontal cortex becomes neglected and undeveloped and in a contradicting to making you more intelligent now makes you less able to learn by constantly injecting stress hormones into your blood stream.  A lot is crammed into this book, over 30 years of research into trauma and I agree with the author, trauma is so important and so relevant in our society. Most people experience some form of trauma throughout their lives, but it seems the younger and more undeveloped you are the more profound the effect is later on in life. It literally passes down from generation to generation and we still do not discuss or treat trauma as a norm. If everyone was more knowledgeable about trauma and how it affects us then I think our medical advice and how we treat people would be far different from what it is today. I find it easy to notice when someone has experienced trauma. It affects their persona, but there are visual and acoustic clues as well. It helps to know if someone has trauma because you have to adapt to their reasoning and thinking which can often be off kilter.  This book is brilliant for psychologists and people who want to learn more about themselves and trauma. It has a diverse knowledge or different applications which are proven to work. Obviously CBT is the most common, but two more I find very interesting and fascinating for trauma treatment is EMDR and Yoga. Both I think are brilliant and I was aware of before the book, but this book shows just what impact it has on masses.  I genuinely feel like when it comes to psychology and nutritional sciences, the USA is years ahead of everyone else especially the UK. I really hope a lot of this work makes it over here sooner rather than later.  Knowing more about trauma means we can help heal our society, prevent abuse and even enrich ourselves.  24 book reviews: This book mentions many important points about trauma and healing (specifically in kids/adults who experienced abuse during childhood), in passages I sometimes really liked, but I am unable to recommend this without critical reservations. For instance, one cannot help but notice the homogeneity of white male Eurocentrism reflected in source after outdated source. Are we really to laud an exploration of trauma, in a 440+ page work, that still manages to exclude almost all but one type of academic voice   that which looks and sounds like the author s own? I m not impressed.  More alarmingly for a title of this scope, van der Kolk repeatedly fails to address systemic issues of the overwhelmingly male-identified assailants who inflict violence and cause trauma to his patients, . In several examples of treatment that he himself administered and included in this book, the cloud of abusive patriarchal reproductions in his male AND female patients left undiscussed   and therefore normalized via complicity   unnerved me.  I caution fellow survivors of male abusers that the ways the author chooses to talk about some accounts can be extremely triggering/uncomfortable (eg, NOT talking about any relevant rehabilitation for male patients who raped and murdered women and children. Then going on to exclaim over the high percentage of people, predominately women, who experience debilitating trauma for the rest of their lives specifically due to sexual violence/childhood abuse   and leaving it at that). You get the sense that his professional/research capacity tops out at being a sympathetic buddy to war vets and a collector of traumatic stories from willing patients (in a later chapter, he openly admits his \"voyeuristic\" therapy tendency). These are just a few of my qualms.  Bessel seems like the problematic archetype of  a good man.  I appreciate his 30+ years of advocacy within the trauma counseling and research community; he has championed trauma-informed care for PTSD patients and established multiple trauma research foundations. His legacy is certain   and that makes the narrowness of his vision all the more disappointing.  If you read this book, consider being additionally mindful of the ways it cannot adequately (or at all) serve the traumas carried by Black, brown and Indigenous bodies, let alone trans bodies and bodies physically disabled due to their trauma. This book may inform you, but I doubt it will impress you.  25 book reviews: Some parts of this book were very triggering. I do not recommend it as a first choice for someone who has Complex PTSD. 26 book reviews: The Body Keeps the Score is a non-fiction book about how the body stores trauma and what you can do about it.  My most distressing take-away from this book was how common trauma is. Author Bessel van der Kolk discusses how people from all walks of life suffer from trauma.  People suffering from these kinds of afflictions believe they are the only ones. They try to numb the pain with drugs or alcohol and are easily triggered which brings back the pain of the traumatic events again and again.  This affects their lives, relationships and ability to trust others.  Kolk details how traumatic memories can be triggered by smells, touch and taste. He explains how powerful emotions remain behind, even after the logical mind has processed the event.  He suggests you ca not think your way out of strong emotions.  What do we do about this?  Form a strong community around yourself with supportive relationships. Practice mindfulness and yoga- exercises that explore the mind and body connection.  Also, find a therapist who practices eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). The author records amazing recoveries by sufferers who utilized this therapy.  Personally, I have practiced EMDR with a therapist and the results were astounding. I left the session feeling lighter than I have in years, having released trauma I did not realize I was carrying.  But, like others, I still struggle with powerful emotions stored in my body. It is a process, not a cure. And I have learned to take life one day at a time.  Highly recommended for readers looking for scientifically-proven ways to handle trauma.  27 book reviews:                              .                                                  .                                                                    .                  .                                       .                            .                              .                                  .

This book was recommended to me a while ago, and there was such a long waiting list at the library that I had forgotten about it. I only heard about these allegations a few days ago and can only speculate about whether or not this affects his credibility as a practitioner, scientist, or author. I can say that those who act in such ways tend to think they know much more than they actually do - an attitude that was unfortunately reflected in the narrative of this book.  This book describes many different approaches to trauma treatment, some of which are proven or evidence-based and some of which are controversial or are based on outdated study. However, van der Kolk presents each one as if it 's a revelation and a comprehensive solution. He also at various points denigrates other recent scientific consensus, such as the existence of false memory syndrome, and voices his disapproval of the DSM V and most use of drugs in mental health treatment.  The author includes many case studies, which do a lot to boost the book 's interest level and readability, but some are not backed up by footnotes. van der Kolk 's descriptions of patients are often oddly specific and vaguely patronizing or reductive, especially for female subjects. Every case conclusion feels simple and complete as if it 's packaged in a neat bow, but what mental health journey is ever that easy? No matter how well a treatment really works, the chapter makes it feel like an infomercial.  I finished the book feeling that I would learned a lot about various trauma treatment theories, but also suspicious that I would been slightly misled. This is in part because of van der Kolk 's lack of attention to valid scientific controversy and positivity surrounding various pseudoscientific treatments (I had to do my own research online to determine which sections to trust). It is also partly because I expected this to have a self-help element, but it did not. Instead it was a primer on various treatments to be used as a jumping-off point. Maybe it would be more useful educationally if van der Kolk was not so credulous. He claims multiple times in the book that he is a skeptic, and yet he is always easily convinced by witnessing one or two miracles.  I think people need to stop recommending this book so broadly, or at least warn that van der Kolk should not be taken purely at his word. I am not sure having to struggle through all of those traumatic stories was worth what I ultimately got out of it.  29 book reviews: I am a master 's level counselor who works with people who have been traumatized. About half of the stuff in this book I liked, but the other half was rather problematic with the author 's embrace of fads and poor science. Unfortunately the weaknesses of this book tainted the strengths.  I agree that child abuse and domestic violence are major problems. I also agree that we ca not expect children to be mentally healthy when they live in abusive environments. I did a practicum at a children 's hospital and I did see kids who had histories of abuse who were medicated into compliance rather than treated from a trauma informed perspective. I felt van der Kolk was spot on there. Unfortunately since he was rather uncritical about many things I ca not exactly trust the quality of his research on things that I agree with and back my own experience.  For one, van der Kolk asserts that memories can be repressed. He broadly dismisses the concerns about false and implanted memories. I have studied this issues extensively and he does not come close to addressing the concerns about false or implanted memories and does not give good metrics of how to tell false recovered memories from genuine ones. Further, the study he listed that supported recovered memories had some issues. Sadly, far too many children are abused, this is a tragic fact. But advocating for recovered memories without better understanding and accounting for the risks of false and implanted memories will backfire because it will lead people to dismiss children and adults who talk about abusive episodes that did happen.  The treatments that van der Kolk advocated was also full of junk such as neurofeedback. While EMDR does work, sort of, it does not work as well as CBT and you also do not need to do the eye movements. People get the same results from keeping their eyes focused. van der Kolk was rather uncritical about the treatments he advocates for while dismissing evidence based treatments such as CBT and barely mentioning methods such as DBT. And as someone who works with trauma who uses both CBT and DBT, his description of how practitioners use those methods is outdated and wrong.  Basically his embrace of junk treatments and recovered memories make it so that I ca not trust his research that validates the things we agree on. While there is a lot in this book I agree with and will say is supported by evidence, the fact that it is half evidence based, half junk science is a major Achilles heel. Not going to recommend.  ",
    " The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse": "book reviews: It is impossible not to like this book. It s entirely made up of charming illustrations and great handwriting and beautiful sentences and jokes about cake. It gives you zero chance to dislike it.  I wish I could dislike it, because I have a very cold and mean soul and it would be very on brand for me to hate something that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, called the most beautiful book/Christmas gift possible and the marketing copy calls  hope in uncertain times.   But alas. I had no chance.  This is the kind of book that you read in 20 minutes and then immediately hand to someone else, who then wants to lend your copy to someone but can t because they aren t a monster and instead buys 10 copies to keep on hand as gifts that seem personal but really aren t.  This giftiness is both the best thing about this and the worst.  At some points this feels more like a collection of quotes than anything else, which is sad because I liked other things about this - the boy, the mole, the fox, and the horse, namely. And I could get inspirational feel-good quotes anywhere (including on this site, by the thousands).  Still, though - this wasn t perfect, but it came pretty close.  Bottom line: Captain America was right about this one.  ------------------             needless to say i loved this so much it broke me in half.  review to come / 4 stars  ------------------   i do not know anything about this book but it looks like it 's going to make me cry  1 book reviews: when i first saw this title and cover, i said AWWWWW! and then, over the holiday season, so many people were praising this book in print and in person, i knew i needed to get a copy for myself. OR, to get a copy for greg because - fox - and read it before gifting it to him. because i am a monster.  for me it 's a mixed bag. on the one hand, the artwork is gorgeous    on the other hand, this    which just, no. like capital-letter NO with all of my being.  again, i am a monster. this is known.  show me a cute animal, and i melt like an ice cap, but human children inspire nothing outta me but low-level panic, gracelessly suppressed. i am just...not interested, which makes me feel guilty as a human person and plays its part in my nightly insomniac personal reckoning/shame spiral. also keeping me from sleep is my cynical inability to be charmed by the well-intentioned but facile insights this book offers up to readers. because people are getting genuine comfort from this book and i feel like a dick for rolling my eyes and imagining these words carved on a block of wood and sold for like twenty dollars.  does this book have messages this girl needs to hear? hell yes.      but then this happens    and it 's like that olde aesop 's fable about the signal and the noise.  i am a monster. my dreams are not coming true, my ship 's not coming in, 'at least i have my health' does not apply, i am growing old and bitter, and platitudes really only work for people with vanilla froyo problems.    if i treat it like a book written in a foreign language, it 's great - i can enjoy the pictures, and i can recognize the individual words even though the messages mean nothing to me.    i am a monster. like the mole, i will eat all your cake.    also, i miss calvin and hobbes.    THE END   2 book reviews: This unforgettable book with the memorable title is a book about friendship, kindness, and self-esteem told in the most special of ways.  First there is a boy. He is alone. He comes upon a mole, whom it seems loves cake more than anything else. The mole becomes the boy s friend and companion, his coach and confidante. The boy shares his fears, the mole shares advice and his love of cake.  When they meet the fox, it is caught in a snare. Instinctively both the fox and the mole know if the mole frees the fox, the fox should then kill it, but if the mole leaves the fox in the snare, it will die. Sometimes you can override your instincts, and the fox becomes a (mostly silent) companion on their wanderings. Then they meet the horse, who has hidden some of its special abilities for far too long.  isn t as much a story as it is a book of advice, encouragement, and lessons accompanied by whimsical hand-drawn illustrations. The advice and lessons are beautiful and meaningful, and the entire book is a genuinely heartfelt experience.  \"What do you think is the biggest waste of time?\"  \"Comparing yourself to others,\" said the mole.  The book is written in a handwriting-type font so it s a little difficult for even older eyes to read, so this is definitely a book that should be read together and shared. Almost every page has something special on it.  I really think this will be the perfect gift for those you want to share a message of encouragement or love with. It s similar to Winnie the Pooh in its content but not so much in narrative or illustration. This will be one you wo not be able to forget.  See all of my reviews at .  You can follow me on Instagram at  3 book reviews: Written in a hard to read font, I found this disjointed effort quite disappointing. There are some nice quotes but no connecting thread or continuous flow as it lacks a narrative. Both the story and the artwork seemed unfinished and I am left feeling incomplete in my understanding of the popularity of this book. 4 book reviews: 5 stunning, powerful, meaningful, and heart-warming stars for my first so called audio book, with a difference, and from a different narrator but a most treasured one. Yes, my 8-year-old Goddaughter / niece narrated this magical little book whilst I sat back and savoured every word and delighted in the look of enjoyment on her face.  I bought this for my little darling 's birthday in July, and she tells me at the grand old age of 8, it is her . My brother then informs me that this precious little one brought the book to school so she could read to the class as part of the Christmas treat 's they were allowed. Not to miss out on this moment I asked her to read to me too over the Christmas holidays, and this fabulous experience goes down as one of my most special moments in the  world - ever .  The story is so simple, beautiful, and adorned with such gorgeous phraseology and meaningful words that will blow your mind for its simplicity and beauty. The wonderful illustrations are a feast for the eyes and match the dialogue between these 4 adorable characters - perfectly. Best to list some of my favourite quotes that add so much to the meaning of life. I am sure you will have a list too....          I turned to my little darling and asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, and she said  ... like you   kind . I still have tears streaming down my face right now.  My reason for sharing this personal and touching moment is this. I want to share a book with you that just blew me away, not just the personal experience. So please buy this book and if you have a child in your family circle, then read it with them or let them read it to you. Equally, you will not be disappointed if you decide to read on your own - whatever age you are. It is so beautiful and magical and is now one of my favourite books of all time   and it s a children s, adults and everyone book. However, I do agree with the views on the font. This will make it harder for younger children to read.  The author wrote this book to lift the mood of the readers and share those parts of life that are important; love, friendship, self belief, tolerance and loyalty. Mackesy is so devoted to its cause and so generous in spirit he signs the book and leaves in places like bus stops and shops, hoping the person who picks it up will understand the importance of the story. He wants this simple but impactful story to bring a smile to the face of the people who find this little treasure - even for a while. How gorgeous is that!!!    Enjoy and be kind !!!! Happy New Year    5 book reviews: I listened to the audio of this, narrated beautifully by Charlie Mackesy in a meditative style that is sublime and just begs to be listened to again and again, whenever you feel the need for it. This is the perfect read and listen in our turbulent crisis hit times, helping to knit back together our battered bodies and souls. I would certainly recommend it for the simplicity of its pearls of wisdom for those suffering from certain mental health issues, such as depression. Needless to say, I am not surprised that this is loved by so many. If you have not read or heard this, I strongly urge you to give it a try. Pure gold.  6 book reviews: \"Sometimes I feel lost,\" said the boy. \"Me too, said the mole, \"but we love you, and love brings you home.\" - The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse by @charliemackesy   This book is so many adjectives: powerful, impactful, lovely, heart warming, comforting, beautifully crafted, brilliant, simply amazing, are just a few that come to mind!   As an artist and aspiring book illustrator myself, Charlie Mackesy 's stunning artwork is incredibly inspiring!   I love how loose his line work is, and the way he changes his media. Paired with his use of certain colors, this is a gorgeous work of art! This book should be a world wide required read! I feel that the simplicity of the phrasing emphasizes how, in life it is very \"easy\" to give up or feel unimportant, but it is just as \"easy\" to ask for help and to simply tell someone you love them. This book and it 's author/illustrator is an inspiration to all!    7 book reviews: I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/petrikleo  Well, isn t this just incredibly wholesome and hopeful.  The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse by Charlie Mackesy was a book that I spotted several times on many best-sellers list. However, I was never interested in it; I never expected or planned to read this book. This was a book gifted to me by my co-blogger, TS; she insisted her co-bloggers receive this wonderful gift, and I m really thankful for her generous gesture. Why? Because I surprisingly loved it. It arrived at my doorstep earlier today; I took a peek and ended up being charmed thoroughly to the end.    I ll keep this brief. The lovely art plus the text was a great combination that captured the feeling of loneliness, kindness, love, and gratitude that the characters felt. There isn t a narrative per se; it s designed like a collection of self-help/inspirational quotes you can usually find on Instagram. But Mackesy s artwork made the text more  alive  to me. The importance of existing, doing our best, and not be ashamed of asking for help were all delivered. I felt like capturing every page because they re precious. It s a short read; try to observe the art and let the text on each page seeps in; don t rush through reading it. Stay with your new four friends for a while.    is a hopeful book suitable for both young and adult readers. Growing up, my parents always taught me the importance of virtue, hope, love, and friendship; as an adult, constantly faced with growing responsibilities and crushing hardships just seem to make it difficult to remember those messages sometimes. This book made me remember those lessons again; it felt like I was taking a break from the harshness of life for a while. It s not even the type of book I usually read, but I know I will be reading this to my kid in the future one day. We always want kids and young adults to grow up with kindness and hope in their hearts; bring positive change to the world. But we can t leave it all to them. We, as an adult, also has a role to play in this. Be the right individual to impart the light of virtue to them. Be grateful, be hopeful, be kind.           8 book reviews: Getting an optimistic overkill while overstraining one 's eyes  Because this book simply kind of wants to make the world a better place It tries to give important, profound lessons about good and bad, struggling with emotional problems, self reflection, and many other topics in a minimalistic way. With some rudimentary drawings and many Buddha zen Yoda wise master style dialogues, scenes, and conclusions, it condenses essential philosophical, ethical, and psychological questions, issues, and problems to a level easy to understand for younger audiences.  Who let the fox out horsing around with a mole? An extremely clever character, or more precise personality and temperament, constellation to give the boy the overkill of deep insights. This might have been the trickiest thing in writing the graphic novel, finding the 3 perfect wise or silent companions to create the best allegories, pictures, riddles, and metaphors thinkable. That s especially complex because there are 2 philosophy prodigies with different, credible perspectives that reflect different schools of thought. At least I got it that way, although I m not sure.  An extreme example of how readers' cognitive biases influence their rating of positive psychology I, for instance, am as dark as it s possible and that s no swagger pimp stuff, just how I roll. But I still believe that a kind of seemingly naive and unrealistic approach, of making kids better future adults, creates a profound difference to somewhen build utopias. Of course, critics can say that the idealized version of reality will let kids hit the ground even harder, but I think that  It doesn t downplay serious topics or has any moralizing dramedy soap opera trigger like other genre examples Instead, it s a perfect balance of profundity and easy to understand concepts. And I also do believe that every adult, who really wants to, can grow back to the idealistic kid she/he once was.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:  9 book reviews: a quiet, meaningful collection of comforting thoughts and lovely art. not exactly the most profound of sentiments, but i feel like, if read at the right moment, it really could be quite impactful.  full of important and gentle reminders, nonetheless.    4 stars  10 book reviews: Lovely illustrations but the words are cringe-worthy. It reads like a shit celebrity 's enigmatic Twitter posts. All faux-wisdom that is not even close to being as deep as it thinks it is. 11 book reviews: A beautiful book with handwritten gems of wisdom about life, love, friendship along with lovely drawings. It was the perfect book to read right now. It takes about ten minutes, but it took me longer because I read it again as soon as I finished it. A real treasure to hold on to or pass on to someone you love, which is what I m going to do. A perfect book for an uncertain time. It did my heart good . It reminded me in some ways of The Little Prince or The Velveteen Rabbit in the way it touched me.  12 book reviews: This is a three-star book that I am awarding four stars because it encourages the sort of kindness and positivity the world needs at a time when everything seems to be going to shit. 13 book reviews:  This is a book for everyone, eighty or eight-   I agree wholeheartedly!  Reading  The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse  written and beautifully illustrated by Charlie Mackesy is a moving, inspiring and comforting experience . Expressed through short and sweet conversations between four unlikely friends - the boy, the mole, the fox and the horse, the author touches upon themes of kindness, friendship, self acceptance and life in general. The handwritten and hand-illustrated format gives this book a personal and intimate feel reminiscent of some of the fables and stories we read as children (and still love and enjoy!). This is a very short read and I reread this book a few times before I finally put it down.  After reading and rereading the book, I took the time to listen to the audiobook and I am so happy that I did! Even if you are not a fan of audiobooks, I would suggest pairing your reading with the audio narration. The author s narration is calm, soothing and simply brilliant. With the backdrop of soulful music and real wildlife sounds, this was a magical immersive experience I shall definitely revisit.  Simply put, this is a special book that you would want to share with your near and dear ones. I certainly will!  14 book reviews: A charming little feel good story of life and the wisdom that comes with it, the love & friendship of family who come in all shapes and sizes . Hand drawn illustrations. Geared for any age, as the author states, \"from 80-8\"   15 book reviews: A particularly maudlin boy, a Yoda-like mole who likes cake, a quiet fox, and a wise horse roam a generic countryside setting saying inspirational Instagram platitudes to one another:   Nothing beats kindness  said the horse.  It sits quietly beyond all things.    Often the hardest person to forgive is yourself    What do you think success is?  asked the boy.  To love  said the mole.   Is your glass half empty or half full?  asked the mole.  I think I m grateful to have a glass  said the boy.   Being kind to yourself is one of the greatest kindnesses  said the mole.  That s just an idea of what you can expect with this book and, if your eyes haven t rolled out of your head, you might get something out of Charles Mackesy s The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse!  Obviously it s just a dressed-up version of random feel-good messages   there s no  story  and it s only superficially a fable. It s also the kind of book that s easy to mock because it s so earnest. But I actually agree with a lot of what s in the book and think anything this positive and encouraging, particularly to those of us with doubt or low self-esteem, which most of us battle with at one point or another, is worth filling your head with. It just gets a bit repetitive after a while   kindness is good, etc.   and less impressive the more it goes on.  Mackesy s artwork is quite skilful though I found some of the pictures too sketchy at times   too many lines making the page seem busier than it should. Some of the art is quite beautiful though like the watercolour pages and the Pegasus sequence.  The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse is a modern-day combo of Winnie the Pooh and The Alchemist which isn t half bad   gentle and sweet, with a good message and full of heart, it s just a bit cloying at times.  16 book reviews: Just to let people know, I have a problem with any recently published books that I reviewed and have rated with 1 star either disappear or have been hidden. This one disappeared and I have added it again.  My previous rating and review disappeared.  I found this nauseatingly awful. Sickly sweet wisdoms spoken from a Christopher Robbin like toddler talking to animals. This reads like a poor copy of Winnie the Pooh without any of the good parts. Even the illustrations and situations are copied from Winnie the Pooh. This takes around two minutes to read, many pages blank for no apparent reason, the worst book I have read in a long time.  17 book reviews: Omg!! I ve heard about this book forever!! I didn t believe it!! I got it free in a sale! It s on my favorites list! It s so simple yet profound!    You are loved   Mel    18 book reviews: It 's hard to find the words for this one. Other people have though. I am not a Pooh fan. (Could those of you throwing stuff at me please stop? I am just not. Sorry to pooh pooh Pooh... ...but it 's just too twee for me.)  This to me is not twee. Okay, occasionally, but in the same way as The Beatles \"All You Need is Love\" is. Mmmm, that comparison feels so cozy. (There 's real music in here too, sheet music which I wish I could read. I have not seen it addressed anywhere and if anyone reads this and can give a sense of the tunes I would love to know.)  It 's all very special, the only book I have ever read where the copyright page comes last. I thought mine was missing it but no and what a great choice because it seems like the publisher is silently saying: we did not want to interrupt.  The words. Spare sentences that are sometimes profound and surprising.  They are at the edge of the water looking at a pair of swans swimming in perfect unison. \"How do they look so together and perfect?\" asked the boy. \"There 's a lot of frantic paddling going on beneath,\" said the horse.  I LOVE THAT!  And on a gorgeous full-color page they are sitting looking at the sky, at a shooting star (sounds a lot more romantic than meteor) and the mole says: \"So much beauty we need to look after.\"  Charlie Mackesy 's mixed-medium artwork is always beautiful with some small surprises tucked in. The lettering is lovely. There are black & white ink drawings, ones with small or large washes of color, ones with even more color and a few full paintings. Some pages have no words. There are two I would love to buy and hang as prints.  A simple book with sweet and sober sentiments. Kids will like the characters and relate to some of it. For most adults who are not able to hug everyone we love right now, I think this is the perfect time to read and send this love letter from Charlie Mackesy to the world.  19 book reviews: 'What is the bravest thing you ever said?' asked the boy...'Help' said the horse. Gorgeous beautiful black/wite brown/white colour drawings, really beautiful. For me though it is not a 5 star which is the average rating I think at Goodreads, why, because it is a bit a bit of supersweet cuteness and morality overkill.   This is probably because I m used to read dark books . So maybe I am not the target group for this book?   But, definitely a book to leaf through, read the wisdom, be in awe of the beautiful drawings,revisit so keep it close on your table, and be captured by the cute friendship between the boy, the mole (personally I liked the mole best, because of the humor in its statements), the fox and the horse in the beautiful drawings. Okay, 3.6 for me.   This is what Waterstones says:  Waterstones Book of the Year 2019, The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse was an instant favourite with our booksellers. A book to bring people together, Charlie Mackesy s inspirational paintings and delicate calligraphic text are a celebration of kindness, compassion and understanding, conveying an essential message for our time. Soothing balm for the soul in these turbulent, polarised times.  This delicately illustrated tale shows that love towards yourself and others is the only thing that truly matters in our hectic world    Nia at Cardiff -  A poignantly human, refreshingly pure and beautifully curated book    Izzy at Piccadilly.\"  20 book reviews: This book is so beautiful it almost makes you want to weep. If you are looking for a thoughtful and stunning book as a present for Christmas then look no further - it s GORGEOUS! This is a wonderful story of unlikely friendships and love which has some fantastic illustrations some of which a a bit reminiscent of E H Shepard s Winnie the Pooh drawings.  The boy first meets the mole and he is adorable - which is something I never thought I d say about a mole since  the little gentlemen in black velvet  wreak annual havoc with my lawn! He is an optimist and feels that most things are better for cake. Absolutely. Totally with him. I love all the illustrations but there are some of the horse that are simply amazing and moving. I love the sentiments of the book and it s one I ll go back to time and time again. What is so clever is its simplicity which actually makes it very powerful.  Just wonderful and I d give it five million stars if I could!!!!  21 book reviews: What a beautiful and inspirational book to start 2021 with. A simple and thought provoking read, where the reader is reminded of the fundamental of goodness and kindness we were all born with.  Beautifully illustrated and you cant help but love the characters as they plod along their merry way, a book that old and young can find joy in and I can imagine a mother reading this with her child. I loved the simple little messages that I think we all need reminding of now more so than ever in order to get through the tough times.  The book is beautifully illustrated in black calligraphy and watercolour.  My favourite quote from the book.    22 book reviews: Ten things I HATE about The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse:  1: NO NARRATIVE THREAD  It 's difficult to write a proper review of this novel/graphic novel/compendium/children 's reference book because it has no narrative thread whatsoever. It 's normal with these kind of experiments, yes, but the meagre paragraphs within are very disjointed and seemingly random. This is especially frustrating when the book 's introduction, penned by the author himself, talks about the characters of the horse or the fox or the personality of the boy. What character and personality? If his creations had any personality, they are still in the author 's head. There 's no narrative thread or character within these pages whatsoever.  2: POP WISDOM FOR THE PRIVILEGED AND UNINSPIRED  The saccharine faux wisdom in this book is heavily uninspired. Phrases like \"if at first you do not succeed, have some cake\" or \"Life is difficult but you are loved\" or \"The greatest illusion is that life should be perfect\" are very superficial. They fly in the face of real hardship and suffering. It 's the kind of quickly-glanced-over quotes on social media accompanied by a sunset pic.  3: NOT ORIGINAL  One would at least expect that the faux wisdom within is new or quirky or has some character of its own. But does not even offer that. The wise quotes are platitudes and clich s that we have been hearing since time immemorial. \"Often the hardest person to forgive is yourself\" (a quote literally copied from another author); \"Success is to love\" (stolen from a famous American poem called 'Success'). The abstract clich s are so uninspired and repetitive that it 's impossible to take them seriously. If they were in the slightest bit original, it might have saved this train wreck. Also, how is he not getting sued for practically plagiarising every word he put down? Oh, that 's right. Because the quotes are so often repeated that they have become trite idioms. They belong to everyone, like \"walking on sunshine\" or \"raining cats and dogs.\"  4: ULTIMATELY PREPOSTEROUS  Really, a child of six or seven would not speak about love and kindness as if he were the Dalai Lama. To the question of what he wants to be when he grows up, the boy replies, \"Kind.\" The book completely forgets about feelings that boys that age ought to feel besides the apparent spiritual enlightenment of a Buddha. Charlie Mackesy has forgotten what a boy that age should essentially be: innocent. With some indignance thrown in, some worry about the current state of the world. And what about some imagination?  5: MONEY  Make no mistake, this book has been published for no other reason besides money. It 's the result of what happens when an Instagram/Twitter artist garners a number of followers and publishers and talent-scouts see an opportunity to rake in old, hard cash. It 's what happened with Rupi Kaur and other eye-roll inducing Instapoets. Anyone with a love for literature and art would understand that Mackesy 's doodles do not belong in a book that sells itself as a children 's story. They belong on another medium. But anyone with a business brain would understand that printing the doodles, binding them and presenting them as a book... well, the rest is history: a New York Times bestseller that sells for  16.99.  6: HYPE  When the author has friends like Bear Grylls and Richard Curtis, it 's obvious that the hype train is going to reach you eventually. These two (and others) have carved wonderful blurbs at the back of this book, describing it as \"a wonderful work of art.\" Miranda Hart, the comedy actress from the BBC series tells us that \"the world needs Charlie 's work right now.\" We do not need overpriced pseudo-profound flimflam to tell us that \"love brings you home\", Miranda. I think the clich s found in this book could have just as easily been carved in some cave during the Upper Paleolithic period. But the hype is what it is and I bought it too.  7: EVANGELIST NONSENSE  This is not directly related to the book itself but the author is a self-proclaimed Evangelist who has recently found Jesus Christ after being an atheist all his life. He has been speaking publicly about this before he published his book and has been previously described as the most famous evangelist in the UK. It does tie in with the very abstract clich s found in the book itself. I am cynical about writers who talk about love and kindness and righteousness from the perspective of religion. We should not be teaching children that love and kindness stem from an omniscient being who made us in his image but simply because it 's the right thing to do for the greater good, for a better, richer, greener planet.  8: MISSED OPPORTUNITY  Several recent studies have found that people who enjoy pseudo-profound quotations, such as the ones you are likely to see on Facebook or other social media platforms (or this book), are not very smart and tend to make bad decisions. Ultimately, the studies say, the people do not even follow the quotes they themselves like but use them as a kind of ego boost or to convince themselves they are better than others. This is quickly proved when people who criticise this book online are harassed and described as 'heartless,' 'evil,' and a slew of other nonsensical titles. This means that the book 's pandering to its social media audience is a missed opportunity at a good story the book could have been had Charlie Mackesy not banked on his followers buying his book no matter what.  9: STORIES TEACH MORALITY  The introduction to this book claims that this \"story\" could appeal to eight-year-olds and eighty-year-olds alike. But the feel-good factor you are likely to get from this book is akin to looking at an inspiring poster at your dentist 's office. You smile and you move on. And you forget less than half an hour later when the dentist is done with filling your molars. Clich s and quotes about kindness and goodness will not have a lasting impact without a good context. It is stories that teach morality. A long time ago, we seem to have understood this. Aesop wrote fables sometime between 620BC and 564BC. Jean de La Fontaine was a 17th Century French fabulist. They both understood back then that morality can be taught with a good story, a good twist, a great plot, some memorable characters. It seems that in 2020 we have regressed and are now applauding Instapoets and social media artists who copy and paste phrases from Brainyquote.  10: PANDERING / MARKETING  I dislike Charlie Mackesy 's book for the reasons above and for one overarching reason. This book represents how the publishing industry can trick buyers into purchasing books that are ultimately disappointing. The hype, the social media following, the blurbs, the author 's introduction, the marketing all promise one thing but provide another. The world is desperate for original stories but it seems that some publishers are so concerned with making money that they are now banking on an author 's social media popularity rather than his actual skill in telling a story, knowing that the book will sell no matter what. I believe that the reason this 'book' has so many positive reviews is because the ones leaving them have come to appreciate the harmless, feel-good, benign shell it represents in a world that is becoming more and more vile, forgetting that the business behind turning it into a money-making machine is similar to Bear Grylls pretending to survive on scraps in dangerous environments in 'Man vs. Wild' but really was just a few feet away from a service road the whole time. It 's a bit of scam. Not a very vile one, not especially harmful and not scandalous as such, but it 's scammy nonetheless.  23 book reviews:        !              !           50  60           \"   \"                     130                      \"   \"                    .                           \"   \"        .                         2                   ...                          !     . :                                                                                                      .                              .            24 book reviews: What an absolutely beautiful book.  The cursive lettering instead of the traditional block font adds to the aesthetic of this feel good story. The illustrations are exquisite watercolor over sketch pencil.  I deeply enjoyed reading this story as much as my children enjoyed listening to it and looking at the pictures. The moral of the story is heartfelt, teaching love and acceptance. It highlights feelings of loneliness and sadness but that we don t have to stay there, we have happiness in those we surround ourself with.  Young or old, this book is wonderful. The moral can either be taught to younger readers, or remind us older readers to find the beauty in ourselves in others.  25 book reviews: My sister bought this book for my daughter, who is a bit of a reluctant reader. My daughter has a processing disorder so reading is a lot of hard work. When the book is so good it outweighs the difficulty of the task of reading, I know the book is a winner. As she was reading, she kept running out of her room to tell me about a cute, sweet or touching part of the book. When she finished it, she handed it to me and said,  Your turn!   It s a beautiful children s book. It reminds me of The Little Prince or even a little like Winnie-the-Pooh. A boy meets a mole, who loves eating cake and giving sage advice. They later meet a fox, who is a little scary but only because he has been hurt in the past. The three meet a horse who stopped flying because it made other horses jealous. Each character has beautiful and poignant advice to give or insightful questions to ask the others. I found that many were things I had said, felt or heard at one point in my life. While there isn t a full narrative going on, it doesn t matter. The interactions between the characters add up to a friendship that lasts longer than the pages in the book. The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse is a lovely little stroll through life lessons, kind words, smart advice and keys to a happy and successful life. Such a sweet little book!  26 book reviews: The characters are just like talking inside your head trying to be honest yet positive and kind.  I have been looking for a book to read since yesterday to give me the feeling of a long, warm hug. I thought I needed a sad book. But that did not work. My fever got worse and I just could not focus.  Well, if you are having a tough time being sick and miserable, and nothing works but want to have a short book next to you, pick this one.  It 's so freaking comforting. It 's really short but each word will make you feel so good and loved.   I love the illustrations. They are quite soothing.  It is like a collection of life quotes but also a reassurance that you matter and that 's all it matters.  I am feeling so much better. Thanks to this book.  27 book reviews: I spent a sunny Autumnal morning reading this book and honestly it could not have been more perfect.   What do we do when our hearts hurt?  Asked the boy.  We wrap them with friendship, shared tears and time, till they wake hopeful and happy again.   This book spoke to me. From the beautiful words and gorgeous illustrations, it was a peaceful and heart warming experience.    I d quote the whole book if I could. Last one.        28 book reviews: \"                                            .\"                 !                                                        .                                                                              .            .                                                                            .                .    . :                                          .                    .  29 book reviews: Passend zum Jahresende 2022 nochmal gelesen.

    " The Deep End (Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book 15)": "book reviews: Yes I am 21 years old. Yes I pre-ordered this book. Yes I read it on release day in one sitting. No I do not regret my decision because my decision lead to pure joy and wholesome fun. 1 book reviews: The misfortunes and misadventures of the Heffley family still make me laugh, although I m beginning to think Murphy s law should be renamed Heffley s law as luck so rarely seems to be on their side! A quick read that entertains and amuses with situations that are often comparable with and relatable to our own unfortunate happenings. 2 book reviews: For the first time while reading the series, I feel this is a perfect proper sequel. A sequel to book number 14 \"Wrecking Ball\". (I cannot get over this reference  )  The story continues while the family ended up losing their house after the extra house construction drama which did more harm than good.  Aunt Reba, thank you for the chaos in this series    I see a huge improvement in the writing and how it 's being presented but the illustrations are almost the same.  But I am quite happy about this sequel. The damn story makes sense. There 's humour and there 's adventure. And moreover, Rodrick 's my forever meme representation. He 's just zzzzing    The family is trying to save as much as possible but they have to have a family adventure together. So off they go to a road adventure borrowing Uncle Gary 's camper van. Damn, I just could not bear the second hand embarrassment the family had to face following the trip    The characters are fun. More fun I would say. The story well planned out with much details. The art is amazing as always. Minimal yet effectively entertaining!  Some parts did remind of Tarzan 's story gone wrong!  And then a bit later on all the summer fun and adventure become alive. Yes, it would have been so much better to read this one during the summer!  All those water and adventure vibes!  Hahahahah! That skunk scene    And the bear in the end. Damn.   I am so saying no to road trips like this!  But I thoroughly enjoyed reading the  amis'adventures of this one!  3 book reviews: After reading a slightly serious book, I decided to read a light hearted book!  I saw this at the library and thought, \"This series is my childhood! Time to relive it.\" So I brought the book home, read it, and have decided that I still love this series to this day XD.  Sure, it 's not a Newbery Honor book, but I checked it out to laugh, and that 's exactly what happened.  The book was so funny, I could not put it down, and I read it in one sitting.  I am glad I read this book, since this time of year is stressful (final exams), and this helped me relax a little and laugh.  So I recommend this book to anyone who is stressed, or a bit down, this book. The whole series can make you laugh and cheer you up!  4 book reviews: I am starting to really feel for Greg. His mom and her constant need to enrich and educate them all as a family is really starting to make me worry if one day they will all crack and become murderers.  I loved how this mirrored the pandemic, without being about the pandemic, which made it both timely and timeless. Because their house got destroyed in the last one, they are living in their grandma 's basement, Dad is trying to work from home, Mom trying to get them to play board games, everyone getting on each other 's nerves.  Then they go on vacation, which turns out horrible as predicted. Poor Greg!  5 book reviews: Gettin' Around with The Heffleys!  Greg and his family are staying in his grandma 's basement since their own house is wrecked. And to repair the house, they need money which they do not have and are trying to save up. So the entire family is crammed in the basement and they are sick of each other 's company and the basement. Greg 's dad is working from home too. They just want to go for a trip or a vacation or anything to get away from here. When they find out that Greg 's uncle left his RV in the driveway, Greg 's mum has an idea and that idea is The Heffleys get on the road with no destination in mind and they experience what it 's like to be a camper or do they?  I love road trips, getaways, holidays, vacations or whatever else you call it or can think of along those lines but camping is something that I hate. Even though none of these things have ever happened to me whilst camping, I felt for The Heffleys but at the same time, I laughed out loud throughout. Fun misadventures. I loved this.  I love it when The Heffleys go away and they all want to do their own thing but never get to do those things. Greg 's mum always wants them to spend time together as a family and make memories but nothing ever goes according to her plans either. Hilarious! Art is spectacular as always and takes the story to another level.  I also loved how this gave me the vibes without being actually being about the , that 's very clever. An amazing read.  4 stars  6 book reviews: jeff kinney coming up with banger after banger since the first wimpy kid book that i bought in 2008 7 book reviews: I totally forgot the release date of this book. This one s actually good and I enjoyed it pretty well.   Total time spent: 55min. 8 book reviews: I do not even know what to say. This series should have ended 3 books ago. It 's the opposite of entertaining. Greg and his family go on a trip in an RV. Did not this already happen in book 9? 9 book reviews: I feel like a child again!!This series is actually my gate to childhood and middle school.I loved this book but i wanted Rodrick to be sassy in this book too...Overall,a very great read  10 book reviews:                    ,   Jeff Kinney                           \"   \"         11 book reviews: Will never get tired of this series even though I am a bit older for these books.  Jeff Kinney never fails to give humor in all of his books. It was a fun quick read with many laugh out moments. 12 book reviews: Fun (and disaster) in the sun with Greg Heffley!  In the fifteenth installment of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, Greg and the Heffley family take a cross country road trip in an RV. And naturally, everything that could possibly go wrong, does, with hilarious, entertaining results.  It 's no secret that I have adored every book in the series so far, but The Deep End was definitely one of my top favourites. The jokes were really on point, and the illustrations really captured and added to the humour of the situation. I found it realistic how frustrated middle schooler Greg was having to spend his entire summer vacation stuck in a confined space with his family. I felt his embarrassment over having to spend time with his uncool parents, subjected to endless teasing by his older brother Rodrick, and Manny, the baby of the family, spoiling his fun by being too young to participate in family activities, meaning Greg could not either. Yet when the chips were down, the Heffley 's were always there for one another.  reminded me of a combination of the , starring and a tamer version of . Recommend for kids, as well as like me.  13 book reviews: How can a book that is fifteenth (and as of now, last) in a long running series be THIS MUCH FUN?! I mean, WOW.  Whenever the Heffleys take a trip as a family their crazy adventures make for some of the most laugh-out-loud hilarious better books for this brilliant series (as proved in The Long Haul & The Getaway), that is also definitely true this time around for their camping adventure. Loved it from beginning to end, as simple as that.  And just like that, in less than a month I have devoured the whole series with all fifteen books. Now what am I going to read? Wimpy Kid and Jeff Kinney maybe forever ruined me for other novels, now I need crazy illustrated storytellings to go along with ALL my boring plain prose books! Get me the sixteenth one ASAP, dammit.  14 book reviews: It is incredibly brave of Jeff Kinny to \"redeem\" Manny the way he did. This boy, this three-year-old child, has become the only thing keeping his family alive. He saved his family from deadly situations twice, and he saved an entire population of people. Manny was not given a redemption ark, he was forced to mature so he could keep his family alive. What a tale, what a character. 15 book reviews: Still one of the best middle-grade book series out there today! The newest adventure has vibes very similar to book #9, \"The Long Haul\", but has enough fresh twists and takes that makes it a great addition to the series. This one also has a \"happier\" family ending than \"Long Haul\" which is nice to see. Dang, I love the Heffley family. :,) 16 book reviews: i m not gonna lie, i own every book in this series and i m not ashamed of it. it s become a christmas tradition that i get the new one every year. i read them as comfort books - books that provide no stress whatsoever. i can relax while reading them and just have fun. there s nothing too serious or emotional that happens in them, and i love that, and watching the silly solutions to the problems that do occur. 17 book reviews:         .           18 book reviews: Erneut am sante Erlebnisse mit Greg und Familie. - Lieblingszeichnung: Die durchn sste Familie hat sich in ihr Wohnmobil gerettet znd aus dem Wandschrank springt ein Stinktier. Einfach wieder irrsinnig witzige Illustrationen. 19 book reviews: i love this book 20 book reviews: Funny, snarky and very entertaining. The family goes camping and runs into all kinds of trouble. They remind me of the family from the TV show The Middle. 21 book reviews: There were 3 Bible stories in this one. Greg, stop trying to convert me to Christianity. 22 book reviews:                                               14   ,                      .                                        ,        ,                           -  ,                        .   : 4,2/5   8,4/10.  23 book reviews: anything for the goodreads reading challenge 24 book reviews: It s funny as usual, the ending part was the most hilarious, 25 book reviews: wanted to finish my challenge so I picked up this and now I m only one book away from completing it:) 26 book reviews:                                        . 27 book reviews: I keep telling myself I m about thirty five years too old to be reading these books but, every time I read one, I sit there laughing like a drain (  which is a very strange expression now I come to think about it). 28 book reviews: 29 book reviews: Another DOW story about Greg 's mom wanting her family to bond. In this one, the family goes on vacation in Uncle Gary 's camper. For those who like tall tales and stories that are larger than life, the latest book in the series is perfect. ",
    " The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book)": "book reviews: I am reading this book, and even though it is a small book, when I finish page 129, I start over again on page 1. I have been reading it for quite a while now, and I suspect I will continue reading it for as long as I can read. A few pages at a time is more than enough to give me something to kick around in my head for a few days or a week.  This is a book that challenges one to live up to four simple truths, and offers transformational results if one could live a life completely engaged in the four agreements. They are so concise that I can state them here. 1) Be impeccable with your word. 2) Do not take anything personally. 3) Do not make assumptions. 4) Always do your best. Simple huh? Track a day and see how many times you break an agreement (in your actions or your mind). To my constant amazement, I find myself stumbling over one or another of these agreements with some regularity. So it helps to remind myself by the constant reread.  I am not reading with a hope that I will attain some mystical state, but I read because I find the author 's explanation of how our mind, our society, and importantly, our relationships work to be insightful, even though it is based on a paradigm that is completely outside my heritage of growing up in a small New England town. Understanding the Toltec dream metaphor is an essential part of realizing the deeper meaning driving our relationships within the world around us. Ruiz does a good job of helping these concepts become clearer.  Ruiz has helped me drop many of my limited belief structures and has opened up insights into living that are valuable to young and old souls alike. Lately, I have started to sense that some of his intricate explanations of how the dream takes control of our lives are unnecessarily complex. That only makes the four agreements more relevant to me in my daily life.  It is 2022, nineteen years after I wrote this first review, and the book is still on my nightstand by my bed. Currently, I do not read from it every day (I think I am starting to get it), but whenever I do, it is a good read.  1 book reviews: I was surprised. I thought I would really like this book. A friend of mine told me the basic ideas were to be impeccable with your word, do not take things personally, do not make assumptions,and always do your best. To me, these sounded great: be honest, be forgiving, give others a chance to say what they think and try your best...or so I thought!  The ideas were actually more along the lines of: do not send out poisonous words that put spells on people, do not let others poison you with their spells (pretty strange, right?), do not have expectations of others, and yes, try your best.  My husband and I were going to read this together, but by page 16 he could not take it anymore! I needed to read it for our book group so I continued on solo.  I found the explanations for these ideas unnecessarily described as being from black or white magic, unnecessarily loaded with examples and I felt the author was talking down to me.  Also, by far the book 's biggest flaw, the information, if it had not been so swollen by overexplaining EVERY single concept, could have been presented in half OR LESS of the length!!!! Really, an elementary student might need all the over-simplified explanations supported by numerous examples, but even a teenager would have felt that Ruiz is beating a dead horse! (As my husband and I did by page 16!)  Another friend told me that the ideas in this book reminded her of things she 's heard before and gave as an example You Are Special, a great children 's book by Max Lucado. I suggest reading that instead of this book.  The book 's ideas felt religious and might be okay for someone who is without religion and looking for some principles to govern their life. But, for me, as a Christian, I felt that these concepts were not only familiar but succinctly summed up in \"love one another\" and \"try to be like Jesus.\"  I really did not like the book, but I suppose that I do not have to worry about the author taking it personally! :)  2 book reviews: I would like to propose this book as required reading for the course, Life. Make four simple agreements with yourself and living becomes so much easier, so much lighter:  1. Be impeccable with your word Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.  2. Don t take anything personally Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won t be the victim of needless suffering.  3. Don t make assumptions Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.  4. Always do your best Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.  What I love about this book * It 's a short, captivating read. I love the efficiency of receiving so much thought-provocation in so little time. * The agreements are applicable to everyone, everywhere, regardless of religion, gender, age, etc. * Stories, anecdotes and examples from various beliefs are intertwined throughout, spotlighting their common bottom lines: love, life and peace.  Possibly the most life-changing book I have ever read. No, really. ?  :)  3 book reviews: Trivial introduction to New Age ethics with a large side order of third-rate, rancid leftovers from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, all written for a third-grade reading comprehension.  Considering that the first agreement is \"be impeccable with your word,\" it 's ironic and even more horrifying that the words in this book are so lazy, careless, contradictory, infantile, incoherent, and devoid of integrity.  Miguel Ruiz thinks that the ideal human is--get this--a toddler:   Uh, yeah. That human also completely loses its shit if for some reason it ca not keep doing what it wants, and if you were to leave it in the woods, like a flower, a tree, or an animal that has not been domesticated, it would --like, really soon, unless it was, you know, adopted by wolves. In which case it would be useless as a human.  There 's a reason people call the period of being 24 to 36 months old \"the terrible twos.\" If you think about it, a toddler is basically \"a living being who lives off of other living beings, sucking their energy without any useful contribution in return, and hurting their host little by little.\" Or at least, that 's what toddlers would be if they did not stop being toddlers. And that, by the way, is Don Miguel Ruiz 's own definition of a parasite--but he 's too dense to realize it. (And if you are inclined to protest that it 's harsh to describe toddlers as as beings that suck the energy of their hosts without making a useful contribution in return, google )  At least the idealization of children explains the childish syntax and diction, the crudeness of the examples. This douche nozzle actually writes:   How the hell does Ruiz know? Has he actually tried it? Is he such a horrible person that he would actually tell a friend that he looks like someone who 's going to get cancer? I seriously hope not, because that most definitely does not constitute being impeccable with one 's word; it 's being wantonly careless, glibly harmful, and perniciously cruel with one 's word. (Shame, shame on Miguel Ruiz. Bad, naughty Miguel Ruiz.)  I would like to hear from anyone who has evidence, however anecdotal, that supports Ruiz 's claim about giving someone cancer with one 's (utterly unimpeccable) word. In the meantime, I can offer this anecdotal evidence to the contrary: one of my relatives suffered for years with severe OCD related to medical issues. This person spent years convinced that they were developing cancer, but they just kept being wrong, because it turns out that mere belief is not necessarily enough to give someone cancer after all. More to the point, people are told all the time, \"Do not smoke! Smoking gives you cancer!\" And they say, \"Meh. That will happen to someone else. It wo not happen to me,\" and even though they do not believe the warnings, they still get cancer. Why? Well, it 's obvious enough: the reason people started getting cancer from smoking in the first place is not that they were told they would get cancer within a year; it 's that . Freakin' DUH.  This book is so devoid of integrity that it even manages to make Hitler trivial and trite in ways not even the most egregious example of Godwin 's Law on the internet could do. Seriously:   The mind reels. Hitler did not merely \"send out all those seeds of fear,\" and his rhetoric alone is not responsible for the \"massive destruction\" he so \"beautifully\" (?!) achieved. He invaded over twenty countries, including Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Britain, Yugoslavia, Greece, Soviet Union, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. He established death camps and systematically murdered six million Jews and is also responsible for the murder of another ten million people, including Poles, Russians, Gypsies, people with disabilities, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah 's Witnesses, homosexuals, and Germans who opposed him for any reason.  Describing a genocide and that much deliberate savagery in trite terms like \"seeds of fears\" that \"beautifully achieved massive destruction\" is vile and something an intelligent reader should object to. The book manages to make evil banal in ways even could not have predicted.  But hey. Guess what will fix everything? TALKING MORE! TALKING BETTER!: \"All human problems would be resolved if we could just have good, clear communication.\"  Except you know who excelled at clear communication? Hitler. And you know who 's shitty at good, clear communication--besides, you know, Miguel Ruiz? \"A child who is two or three, perhaps four years old.\" The \"wild,\" \"undomesticated\" human that Ruiz posits as the ideal human totally sucks at the thing that Ruiz says will solve all our problems.  This would be a significant flaw if Ruiz were actually trying to formulate a sophisticated system that would offer human beings a coherent guide to ethics and behavior--if, that is, his work had any integrity. But it obviously does not. My guess is that Ruiz 's one and only goal is to convince gullible people to buy the shit he 's peddling, and he has clearly succeeded very well at that.  There is no wisdom in this book, only cheap platitudes. And if you ca not recognize that is full of bullshit, well, science says there 's a reasonable chance that you are just not smart. See for details.  4 book reviews: OK. So. I liked several parts of this book very much. I love that happiness is a choice. I especially appreciated reading about the third agreement: Do not Make Assumptions because communication is something I can always work on. I loved the parts about accepting and loving yourself and others. There is some amazing advise in this little book and I can see how it can be life changing for many people.  But.  I am going to be honest and admit that Ruiz almost lost me at \"Everything is God\" in the introduction. Even though it sounds very pretty when said by a dude made of stars and fog, \"Everything is God\" is a meaningless statement. That 's just something people say to blow everyone 's mind and make themselves appear deeper than they actually are. Believe what you like about God, but saying everything is God is just the same as saying nothing is God, in which case you ought to go ahead and say what you mean and be a respectable atheist.  He almost lost me again at the John Lennon quote, just before the beginning of Chapter One. Little known fact: John Lennon quotes are a pet peeve of mine. Who knew- right? And then again when he kept using the word \"dreamy-dream-dreamer\" to make everything sound super emotive and enlightened. Not that there 's anything really wrong with that- just not my thing.  And I admit I was annoyed by his over-simplifications, his vagueness about the evils of \"the dream of the planet\" (societal expectations) and again by his many generalizations- especially about how NO ONE is free to be herself because we are ALL \"domesticated\" (brainwashed) by society and our parents and teachers and church leaders, ALL blind, ALL narcissists. Which, you know, is not entirely true.  I am certainly not a conformist, but I believe there needs to be a balance- some things you should conform to. Like not stealing. Or speeding through residential neighborhoods. Whether I am personally feeling it or not, many societal expectations are not relative. They are necessary. On the other hand, if by \"the dream of the planet\" he means cultural customs like judging people for their hairstyle or the music they like then I agree that \"the dream of the planet\" is bad news. See, it would be helpful if he were slightly less mysterious in his approach.  Once I managed to sort through the new-age incense and magic (Not my flavor), I actually agreed with the four agreements. Imagine that. It turns out I have heard them before from Mother Teresa, C.S. Lewis, Dr. Seuss, Steven Covey, Jesus Christ, and many others. Life is infinitely better when you are honest and courageous enough to accept yourself, communicative in your relationships, positive, open and loving, forgiving of yourself and others, and continually trying to do your best. That is how we become a happy person. That is what most religions teach. That 's what most schools encourage. That 's what science shows. Its no secret- its just surprisingly difficult to remember and put into practice. Props to Ruiz for reminding me of this and for writing a book to help others. While his writing style made me vomit a little in my mouth, still he meant well and has assuredly encouraged many on the path to happiness.  I would add, it is my personal belief that our reason for being- our purpose on earth is to learn to be happy. And truly happy people are always good people. Not perfect, but good. And I would add further that it stands to reason that the better a person is, the happier she becomes. Which is where religion takes the four agreements a step further, claiming that we are eternal beings and if so then we are day by day over an eternity either becoming more like God, or less like God. We are either progressing towards perfect happiness or perfect misery. Christianity also adds that we do not need to do this on our own, which idea rings true and logical and brings me comfort.  Wow. Ruiz inspired me to write my own book.          5 book reviews: The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Book, Miguel Ruiz  The Four Agreements, was published in 1997 and has sold around 5.2 million copies in the U.S. and has been translated into 38 languages.  The book advocates personal freedom from beliefs and agreements that we have made with ourselves and others that are creating limitation and unhappiness in our lives.  The Four Agreements are: 1 - Be impeccable with your word. 2 - Do not take anything personally. 3 - Do not make assumptions. 4 - Always do your best.           :                                                    :                                 (   )   :            :          2002    :                          :                      1388   128   9786009114916        -               -   20    :      :            1393   120   9789649027098    :      :            1384   128   9789649559032    :            :              1380   130   9643281310                     1392    :      :            1384   144   9646581420    :      :                                  1393   175   9789647974936    :             (   )   :            1382   171   9647047088      :                                            1391   198   9786009293926                                                                                   ( )                                (                 )                 (             )             (     )                 (         )            : (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             )             17/10/1399    04/09/1400     .    6 book reviews: This little book is going to tear your heart open, put a light of love in it. This light will grow and become a fire, then you start spreading the love of light to your family, your community, your nation, to the world and to the universe.  1st Agreement: Be impeccable with your word. The word impeccable derives from the Latin word impeccabilis, a combination of the Latin prefix in-, meaning \"not,\" and the verb peccare, meaning \"to sin.\" To speak a word is a gift from god. Learned men would always have a firm grip on the words they speak, and they would never incur sin with harsh words.  2nd Agreement: Don t take it personally If you re in a bus stand waiting for a bus and some random person says you re stupid. Don t react or get into fight, if you do so, then deep down you have a belief that you re stupid. Don t take it personally even if someone shoots you in the face.  3rd Agreement: Don t make assumptions If you re making assumptions, then you re bringing hell in your dream (According to author, we all are living in a dream, yes, like in Matrix.). Don t worry about your future, don t ruminate your bad past incident. Be present.  4th Agreement: Always be your best. This is difficult. If you wake up fresh and energized, then you progress your day with enthusiasm and positivity. But, if you had a fight with your spouse, then you feel sad and let your emotions take over and you make your day terrible. Always be and do your best, whether you re happy or not, whether you re healthy or sick. In order to comply with the 4th agreement, first you must master the first 3 agreements.  It is not easy to master the above agreements, but don t give up. If you break the 1st agreement by yelling, then start all over. Living in accordance with the above agreements is a way of living a good life.      7 book reviews: This is my second time reading this book and I picked it up again because I felt I was compromising too much in my life and it was affecting my core. I have a chapter to go but here 's the summary:  The book cites four agreements that, with practice, will lead you to a happier state of living, essentially and dramatically, lead you out of your living hell. The idea is focused 100% on you. You can only control yourself and only honor yourself.  1. Be impeccable with your word. Your word is your power to create the events in your life. It can create positive events or destructive events. Impeccable means \"without sin\". So the idea here is that you use your word without sin against yourself. You take responsibility for your actions but you do not judge and blame yourself. There is a big difference. And as you practice your impeccable word do not you think the very actions which might have caused you to judge and blame yourself before will decrease and it will become easier to truly know the difference between taking responsibility and punishing yourself (over and over again).  2. Do not take anything personally. Do not take compliments or insults or anything in between personally. If you know who you are and are impeccable with your word (i.e.: being yourself, not going against yourself) then you will get better and better at not allowing others to shape how you feel about yourself. This particular chapter I struggle with because I personally like to build people up by showing them how I feel about them and what I think about who they are. It is a rare thing for me to tell someone something negative unless i am trying to be a friend to help them through something and they need to hear it. However, I will re-read this to try to gain more meaning and understanding out of it.  3. Do not make assumptions. This almost requires no comment. We do this ALL the time. I know I do. You hear someone explaining their situation and as they are you are summarizing it in your own words in your head, filling in blanks because you want to have the complete picture. Except it 's not the complete picture because rather than ask questions to fill in the blanks, you used your own experience and assumptions to do so.  4. Always do your best so that you will not judge and punish yourself. Do things because you want to do them and do your best, not for some reward. Enjoy your life. Live it now. And your best may not be the same every day if you are sick, tired, or you have fallen victim to beating yourself up. Doing your best means doing your best with the previous 3 agreements also and it means you may not always live up to your desire to always honor them. But it 's your best so do not judge yourself.  8 book reviews: I never thought I would fall for a book by someone who would allow this picture of himself to adorn the back cover:    I ca not explain it. I am not one to be floored by silly, little self-help books full of spirituality and cliches and horrible stories and simple advice. But I was. This book might just change my life.  I will hand the rest of this review over to David Foster Wallace:  \"It seems to me that the intellectualization and aestheticizing of principles and values in this country is one of the things that 's gutted our generation. All the things that my parents said to me, like 'It 's really important not to lie.' OK, check, got it. I nod at that but I really do not feel it. Until I get to be about 30 and I realize that if I lie to you, I also ca not trust you. I feel that I am in pain, I am nervous, I am lonely and I ca not figure out why. Then I realize, 'Oh, perhaps the way to deal with this is really not to lie.' That seems to me like something our generation needs to feel.\"  9 book reviews: This book is juvenile. The universally acceptable platitudes that make up the four agreements are the only useful phrases in the book. Every explanation is conclusory, circular, and intentionally unclear. His conclusions are not drawn from any deductive reasoning or analysis, and nothing rings true. I suppose you could find solace in the book if you wanted to blame your parents and society for your unhappiness, but I am not unhappy and I do not believe that anyone else is responsible for my happiness. Do not waste your time.  10 book reviews: When I read this book in 1994, I was on a freefall through space. Stress at the middle management level can hit you like a banshee 's scream!  But Ruiz grounded me.  It had turned out to be a result of dangerously high blood pressure (like, going thru the roof). Oh, well. In the weird world of hypertension, I was ushered into the beginner 's level of hypertension meds.  I stabilized quickly.  And this book made me stop and smell the roses (just like the beautiful book Awaken the Starlight Within, in the slot this weekend).  I had to stop. An early retirement beckoned.  It had all started with Fred, may he rest in peace...  Fred was a retired Sergeant-Major who liked to mentor his new bosses, but I let him down badly on that count.  Fred, like the rest of my workers, was a man of the world, and I was not. When Fred had a heart attack, it shook me up. I was suddenly mortal by proximity.  I could see Fred 's family disdained me, visiting him in hospital. Did I deserve their disdain? Probably. My management style had specialized in tunnel vision!  Self-doubt pierced my rigid armour.  That was my free-fall that spring into hypertension and insecurity.  Given a regimen of working half days by my doc, I recuperated with books like The Four Agreements. It spoke to me. It showed me the Good Sense I sadly lacked!  When I went back to work weeks later, I had become - finally - a people person. I worked harder on getting results, less on number-crunching and I tried to befriend my colleagues.  Though still no man of the world, Ruiz taught me to keep my feet on the ground and be affable:  And not a Distant Manager!  11 book reviews: Every human is a magician, and we can either put a spell on someone with our word or we can release someone from a spell. We cast spells all the time with our opinions. An example: I see a friend and give him an opinion that just popped into my mind. I say, \"Hmmm! I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer.\" If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year. That is the power of the word.  This book is what my mother would have called \"woo-woo.\"    LOL No, not that kind of woo-woo. 'Woo-woo' meaning really 'out there' or 'hippie-dippie' or whatever people would call New Age stuff nowadays.  That being said, I think the author 's heart is in the right place and I think he touches on some very good topics and advice. He 's basically teaching the reader Buddhism. He does not put it that way, but... *shrug*  I am going to try to boil this down for you and strip out the woo-woo so you can really understand what Ruiz is getting at.  He is basically saying that you should live your life by four agreements:  1.) This means, basically, do not gossip, spread venom, or hurt others with your words. Because words are powerful and they can really damage people.  Not only are you damaging other people with your hateful/thoughtless words, but you are damaging yourself.  I basically agree with this, although when the author (in the paragraph I opened this review with) basically says I have the power to give people cancer, I am a bit skeptical. o.O ...   2.) People insulting you or trying to make you feel like shit (and sometimes succeeding) are really fucked-up. They are not pointing to you and calling you stupid/ugly/fat/etc. because you really ARE stupid/ugly/fat but because they are fucked-up inside and therefore they are saying hateful things and looking at the world in a skewed way.  Laugh it off. Brush that dirt off your shoulder. Do not take what people say to you personally. It really has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.  I do not FULLY agree with this, but I think in general it 's a great concept. Very difficult to do, though. I think it would take a lot of practice to reach this level of zen.    See? Look at this paragraph, which basically is how the whole book goes. This first part I agree with: you are wonderful. Other people telling you 'you are wonderful' is to be ignored, because you should KNOW you are wonderful and not be dependent on other people 's praise of you.  I have already got that and agree with it. Great point.  But then he brings up this  'shooting you in the head' thing. I mean, o.O Yes, I guess you should not take it personally... SINCE IT'S HARD TO TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.  I do not know, I feel like the author is sometimes taking this too far. ...   3.) Communicate with other people. Do not date/marry people expecting they will change - or wanting them to change. Love other people for who they are.    Yes, I already know this and live it. Let me explain to you my philosophy.  For example, I do not date smokers. It would be very bad form of me to see a man I liked, respected, was attracted to - and decide to date him, KNOWING that he smokes. This would not be okay. Because I do not like smoking, and I would be unhappy - even if the man was all other good things: sweet, funny, kind, smart etc. Therefore I refuse to date smokers - no matter how sweet and cute they are - because I know I would end up miserable and making the man miserable. A smoker can be my FRIEND, I have friends who smoke - everything is fine. But once you make it into a romantic relationship it 's a no-go. I am not into nagging and I avoid dating men who I would end up nagging.  This goes for everything. If you are the kind of vegan who is really, viscerally upset by people eating meat, do not date a meat-eater. If you only like thin, skinny women who jog - do not date a sweet, smart, funny fat woman and expect her to change. If you marry a man who is lazy, guess what? He is still going to be lazy after you are married. You nagging him 24/7 is not going to make him any less lazy. The only thing that will change is that you will both be miserable.  I ca not tell you how many of my friends I have seen suffer horribly trying to please someone who allegedly 'loves' them. If you love someone, you do not try to change them into something they are not.  So although I am wording this a lot differently than Ruiz, I basically agree with him. And communication is the key. You have to nip that shit in the bud. For instance, if you are a fat woman, and you are dating a man, the first time the man pulls some shit about your weight you have to shut that down. For instance, he suggests you order a salad as your meal or he asks you 'Are you sure you want seconds?' or he, out of the blue with no encouragement from you, buys you a gym membership or some shit, you have to step up and make it clear how things are going to be. Be like, \"Look at me. I am fat (or 'x size, or plus-size, or curvy or whatever you call it). That 's not going to change. Either accept it and enjoy it, or get the fuck out of my life.\" Okay, maybe do not say 'fuck.' But you know what I mean.  I would even go so far as to state this up front BEFORE he pulls any shit. You can be gentle, but make it clear that what you see is what you get.  Goes for anything. Steak-lovers dating vegans/vegetarians, people who have high-paying jobs dating people with low-paying jobs, people who love fashion dating people who wear sweats every second they are not at work, people who love playing sports dating people who think sports are boring, etc. etc. etc. etc. If you are trying to change your lover than you do not really love him/her.  This 'assumptions' thing is all about communication. It could be \"That man smiled at me. He must have a crush on me!\" when really he 's just friendly. Or \"Susie did not return my call yesterday. She must be angry with me or not like me anymore!\" Maybe she just had her phone on silent. Do not assume stuff. Instead, ask people questions and get their thoughts. Do not jump to conclusions. ...  4.) Rather self-explanatory (you would think) but I got kind of muddled in this section.  For instance, Ruiz says    Which sounds like he 's saying, \"Do a job/career you love. You should love going to work every day.\" And that is a nice, great concept, but I do not know how realistic this is. Just saying. Ruiz says:      Okay, again, I agree with Ruiz - but I do not see him offering any kind of practical advice or alternative. Yes, tons of people - most people, I would say - have jobs they do not enjoy. What are you gonna do? Not everyone can be an author! (At least, an author who earns a living wage.) I do not really feel like this section was very helpful. ...    A lot of bullshit about how people are stars, we are all connected and everyone should love everyone. Some weird talk about 'being a warrior' which was not really explained and did nothing but confuse me. And some prayers that I did not feel were particularly inspiring.  ...         ...   Another interesting thing is that Ruiz seems to have this idea:    I have read about 85 books with this idea in it and I have to tell you it is a foreign concept to me. I never talk to myself this way. NEVER. If there are people who talk to themselves that way, I feel very sorry for them. :( I mean, other people are bad enough, I ca not imagine putting YOURSELF through this kind of hell. I guess I am lucky, because my kind of self-talk seems to be very positive and encouraging, and I think , because life is very rough. I ca not imagine being an enemy to yourself like this.  Perhaps this is in so many books because it is 'normal?' Gosh, I hope not. Please, if you are the kind of person who puts yourself down, try and stop this. :( The world is such that sometimes you are the only friend you have, and if you talk to yourself like this, then that means you do not even like YOURSELF, and that is very horrible. :( Be your own friend. Be kind to yourself - because you ca not count on other people being kind to you. ...  Well, that 's it. I hope this review was not too 'woo-woo' for anyone, I tried to be real.  Pretty good concepts, although sometimes I felt that Ruiz either a.) took it too far, and b.) did not really offer you any solutions for things he said you should avoid. A short, quick read. ...  P.S. I would just like to note that this book reads as if a 10-year-old had written it. This is not a compliment, I am not saying, \"Oh, this was easily accessible to the reader,\" what I am saying is that this book has juvenile writing and it is as if you are reading something your nine-year-old wrote in English class. o.O This is no , is what I am saying. o.O  12 book reviews:                                                   ^^ 5/28/2019 -----       \"   \"                          .                                                      .                         .                                                                                                                 .                                              .                                                                            !!...                                                                                                                                            7/3/2018  13 book reviews:                 ...             ...           ...   !!!!...                   ...       ...       !!!...         ...22           14 book reviews: Promoted as  A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,  The Four Agreements was not my first choice to read in my spare time. Upon request of a dear friend, I forcibly attempted this 138-page book mustering somewhat of an open mind. Already, I have wasted many years as an idealist, grasping at wishful thinking as a way to truth. Being a childhood survivor of religious indocrination, I now err on the side of skepticism before embracing any proposal as legitimate. That preface made, I share with you my thoughts about The Four Agreements.  Not surprisingly, author Don Miguel Ruiz was born into a family of shamanism. This background led him to explore a path of self-inquiry and ancient ancestral wisdom. From his experiences, he penned the essay-like Four Agreements, expressing his viewpoint about the self.  He opens the book with an old tale about a man calling himself  The Smoky Mirror.  My skepticism nearly gagged at this point, and I was only through the roman numerals of the book pages. I could already see which direction he was headed. He launches into a romanticized dissertation about the Domestication of the Planet and ends with a statement of living in heaven on earth. If that s not an overused clich , what is? Now, we are ready for the life-altering Four Agreements sarcasm intended.  What are the Four Agreements?  1. Be impeccable with your word. 2. Don t take anything personally. 3. Don t make assumptions. 4. Always do your best.  Was this a revolutionary message worth 138-pages of my time? What unique perspective could he shed on these hackneyed topics purported by flashy motivational speakers? I expected disappointment, but I suspended my disbelief initially. After reading some of the following statements, I no longer took his book seriously. It transformed from self-help into a humorous description of his biased utopia.  Here are (only) three of the outrageous statements that have no factual basis:  1. I see a friend and I say,  Hmmmm! I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer.  If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year. That is the power of the word. (page 29) 2. Love in action only produces happiness. (page 128) 3. The only reason you suffer is because you choose to suffer. (page 129)  As you deduced, this book seemed a shallow journaling of the positive-thinking-movement. I speculate that the writers of the publicized book,  The Secret,  found a predecessor in this book. For those who swear by The Secret s principles, cozy up in your reading recliner with The Four Agreements and a steaming cup of coffee. Immerse yourself in the pages of this elementary-level read. Experience those warm and fuzzy feelings while you think happy thoughts and live in that fairytale land of Peter Pan.  15 book reviews: 2020: January As with every year I try to re-read this gem of a book. Will this be the year I practice all four agreements? Stay tuned to find out.  2019: November According to Goodreads, this is my 6th time reading this book. Every time I pick it up I feel renewed that I need to find a way to implement all four agreements.  2019 One of my favorite books to re-read at the start of the year.  2018 There are four simple agreements, if we are able to stick to these four things, our lives will improve significantly. These four agreements are:       While these are \"Simple\" agreements, there is nothing simple about not taking anything personal, not making assumptions and always doing your best. I do believe these are four really great principles to live by and I look forward to putting these into practice.     2017 At the beginning of every year I try to read this book, maybe this year I will make it a monthly read. This book challenges us to do four \"simple\" things in order for us to live a more fulfilling life. I love how practical these challenges are, but each year I fail to live up to all. For the most part, I try to be impeccable with my word because I am firmly believe that your words create worlds. I keep telling people about the power of their words so this is an agreement I try to live as closely to as possible. The others are a little difficult but I think with constant reading and practice it will become a habit. This should be mandatory reading for everyone.  A very powerful, life changing book, providing you do as instructed. Granted I have heard all of the Four Agreements in some form or another, but in this format I really \"got it\". The Four Agreements are: Be Impeccable With Your Word Do not Take Anything Personally Do not Make Assumptions Always Do Your Best All Four Agreements are things that can be done, but will be really hard. After reading this book, I honestly saw how I sometimes get in my own way, in the way I speak, how I take things personally and by making assumptions. I honestly do believe if you work at these Four Agreements, your life will change in phenomenally.  PLEASE READ.  16 book reviews: This is my third time returning to this book, and each time I absorb it more in-depth and find further wisdom within the words. I love that it 's a quick read, so it 's easily doable in a day or on a long car ride home. It sounds simple to believe we can live our lives based on four main agreements to overcome things like frustration, anger, sadness, envy, or any other difficult emotion. That assumption would be correct in the sense that it is not just about implementing the four agreements broken down within the book. It 's also about breaking the agreements we have accepted from an early age, which takes years of repeated trial and error and overriding the impulse to please others. This book is a definite read for anyone looking for a straight to the point pathway to transformation and inner freedom. Taking action on the four agreements within the book is a lifelong process. Still, even within the few moments of learning about the Toltec way, you will be able to start mentally releasing any unnecessary burdens or suffering and begin walking a lighter path. This one will always be a favourite I will come back to throughout the years.  17 book reviews: The Four Agreements is a simple and short presentation of some very deep wisdom. In a world filled with spiritual reading material, this one 's a goodie. It just made a lot of sense to me.  These lessons come from the shaman culture of Central America. \"Toltec knowledge arises from the same essential unity of truth as all the sacred esoteric traditions found around the world. Though it is not a religion, it honors all the spiritual masters who have taught on the earth. While it does embrace spirit, it is most accurately described as a way of life, distinguished by the ready accessibility of happiness and love. introduction pg x. Happiness and love! Sign up the Hippie Librarian, pronto.  The book goes on to talk about how everyone has unconscious beliefs that we pick up as children. We view and experience our world through these beliefs. Most folks are not even aware that they have them and this causes a myriad of misunderstandings and problems: pg 17.  So, how do you cut through the fog of these beliefs to see clearly? Ruiz suggests using The Four Agreements.  The first is: pg 46. This includes your inner voice, the way you talk to yourself and how you narrate your reality.  Ruiz mentions that some people talk to themselves in a manner that they would find unacceptable to use with the people they care about. Change the way you speak and, Ruiz claims, your life will follow.  The second agreement is: pg 59 This helps you because: pg 63.  The third agreement is  wouldo not make assumptions': pg 74. Now that I have been looking for this, I have caught myself assuming things all the time.  It 's funny how quick hurt feelings evaporate when I just put an \"assumption\" label over any stories I have concocted. It has actually been world-changing for me: to realize how many stories I make up because I am bored or confused or simply do not know what someone else is thinking. And to realize that they are not real is such a relief. Really.  Finally: pg 85.  This was another big one for me. I used to get down on myself about how circumstances played out even if I had nothing to do with it. Now, I just pause and give it a quick think over, \"Did I try my best?\" Generally, yeah, I was trying my guts out.  And that 's all I can ask of myself, really. I ca not control the uncontrollable, I can only do the best I can with what I have got in front of me.  may help readers live in the now and experience life as it is rather than as they have imagined it to be. At least, that 's what it has done for me. Also recommended for readers who may be interested in spirituality but want a easy place to start. This one is simple and packs a big punch in a very few pages.  18 book reviews: There are so many lessons we can learn from past cultures...this book is rich with wisdom that comes from the past, yet still can guide us to a better future. The core of this book (for me) is that we have to come into agreement on how we will go through life; if you are untrue to yourself how can you be true to anyone else? Uplifting and inspirational! 19 book reviews: Miguel Ruiz' self-help nonfictional work could easily be summarized in a few words, and if - upon reading the book 's blurb here on Goodreads, which basically provides such a summary - you find nothing worth investigating in this novel, then maybe you should rather choose another book. Ruiz' ideas are very insightful and thought-provoking, but in their core nothing ground-breaking and some of his examples are actually rather questionable.  Ruiz basically implies the importance of standing up for yourself, not allowing others to influence your thoughts and your way of living in a negative way, instead living the way you want to live and not allowing expectations raised by society to affect your life. The tone of his prose was rather straightforward, but also condescending at certain points. All the time Ruiz repeated the same formulaic idea that nobody should take things personal, but his writing gave the impression of something along the lines of \"but please do take those things personal which I am telling you about right now\". Ruiz divides his book into four major steps, so-called 'agreements' which you have to adapt to in order to successfully change your life for the best, according to him. Those four agreements are called 1) be impeccable with your word, 2) do not take anything personal, 3) do not make assumptions and 4) always do your best. He also offers lengthy explanations and nonfictional examples to support those agreements.  Miguel Ruiz used to work as a surgeon until a near-death-experience convinced him of changing his life and delving into the deepest parts of himself, parts of which can be found in this book. Ruiz' enthusiasm about the concept he is living by basically flows through the entire text, allowing it to turn into a very uplifting book of highly readable and rather simplistic messages, yet Ruiz successfully managed to provide food for thoughts.  Even though I personally liked Ruiz' self-help novel a lot (it has actually been my first self-help novel, if you forget about disguised self-helpers like ), I can see why others would disagree with some of his messages, especially with his examples. Ruiz' concept of the  wouldream of the planet' seemed far-fetched, and it always felt as if he was trying to make everything sound too simple, as if he did not take different factors into account which would affect those four agreements in certain ways. I am going to give this book 4 stars since Ruiz' prose is incredibly readable, and his basic ideas and concepts resonate well with my own perceptions. Recommended for readers who are generally interested in this specific genre.  20 book reviews:                            .

There were a few nuggets that were very enlightening but a lot of unoriginal concepts or overly fluffy statements as well.  I found myself thinking \"hey, that reminds me of...\" very frequently while reading this book. The book reads like retreads of various scriptures, warm fuzzy stories, and self-help manuals. It 's not a new concept that words are powerful and we should think and speak positively about ourselves and others. Not taking things personally is another not-new self-help idea. Same with not making assumptions and always doing your best. A lot of the advice is couched in \"fuzzy\" terms that just irritate me...black magic vs. white magic, visualizing and imagining, we live in a dream of hell? While the concepts behind the language may be accurate I just had a hard time taking it too seriously with language like that.  I particularly struggled as a parent reading the first chunk of the book. We have to teach our children , just so they can function in society and have a structure to hang their lives on, but Ruiz seemed so against \"domestication\" that he almost seemed to advocate not passing our beliefs and teachings on to our children because they have no real choice in whether or not to believe them when they are young. I suspect if I had the chance to actually have a conversation with him, he could clarify the confusing and sometimes contradictory passages in the book, but I do not have that opportunity. And I am left with a book that seems to have some good, though not really original, ideas - with no real outline for how to apply them.

It 's written in a simple manner, but it addresses difficult issues that can help you make significant changes in your life.  Ruiz describes the Toltec word Mitote near the opening of the book, which translates to He goes on to say that the majority of us have been living our lives based on the perspectives of others rather than how we want to see ourselves and conduct our lives. The first section of the book explains how each of the agreements might influence how we think about ourselves and how we interact with others.         A section called \"Be Impeccable With Your Word\" was really helpful to me. This agreement covers how to avoid gossip, lying, empty promises, and other ways that our words might cause issues. Only express what you mean, and be aware that if you are not careful, you could hurt someone.  Grab your copy or  24 book reviews: Ruiz used to be a surgeon, until he fell asleep at the wheel one night and crashed into a wall. He recalls being outside of his physical body pulling two people from the wreckage. The near-death experience woke Ruiz to the teachings of his people, The Totecs, and thus renewed his original commitment to learn the Four Agreements.  This book spoke to me on a universal level because its principles are in harmony with the methodology of many other transformational techniques, and most importantly, with God himself. Ruiz breaks down the four agreements into simple language with spiritual undertones. He stresses that just doing your best in everything you do will help you keep the other three agreements: 1) Being impeccable with your word, 2) Do not take anything personally, and 3) Do not make assumptions.  Reading this book will touch, move, or inspire you with its possibilities for living a powerful and happy life.  25 book reviews: The Four Agreements 1. Be impeccable with your word. 2. Don t take anything personally. 3. Don t make assumptions. 4. Always do your best.  I was given this book as a Birthday present from my little brother. He said its teachings can be life changing. I ENJOYED it a lot!!! As with any self help type of book you gotta \"take some\" and \"leave some\" if you know what I mean? For me this was a definite TAKE way more than leave. My brother and I have similar personalities and I can see very much why he gave me this book. As soon as I read the inside cover I knew this was going to be something that connected with me, my life, and my way of thinking. Honestly, I think anyone and everyone who reads it can benefit and take something away making their life better. The bottom line in this book is that life is all about love---how to give it and receive it. This has been a long time belief of mine---that life is all about learning to love, unconditionally loving the way our Creator loves.  INSIDE COVER: BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD: Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the Word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your Word in the direction of truth and love.  DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY: Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won t be the victim of needless suffering.  DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS: Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.  ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST: Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.  26 book reviews: This quick read was interesting in that I gained a new perspective on how others view the world. The book itself is quite simply written and very repetitive, and although brief, could have been about 1/8 the length to get the main points across. There are definitely some good takeaways that we should all apply to our lives. I always struggle with individualistic worldviews, even if the goal is to love others, so that might have been difficult for me to get past. Additionally, the book was sprinkled with pot shots at various mainstream religions, but when they lack any substance, that also leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I am glad I read it for insight into others' views, but did not glean much additional deep insight into the world and was not impressed with the writing.  27 book reviews: New age psycho babble that nearly had me giving up, but it was so short I persevered. The middle part was good, how to change your life with the four agreements: speak impeccably, do not take things personally, do your best and some live each moment or something. Good stuff, but not ground breaking or earth shattering. We know all this stuff, but it is nice to be reminded and hopefully inspired to do better. Unfortunately it ended with more new age stuff. It 's sort of a sandwich and just like an Oreo, the best stuff is in the middle. It 's most redeeming quality is that it is very short.  28 book reviews: I know this little book is the type of clich  self-help item that makes its way to the impulse-purchase-friendly shelves by the registers at Barns and Nobel around Christmas time and subsequently gathers dust on bookshelves across the nation unread by recipients because they are not the \"type of person who reads self-help books.\"  But please do not judge this book by it 's section.  The writing is a bit choppy and the use of repetition can be annoying initially, but the message is completely worth it. Although many of us have probably heard this type of logic before (you get what you give, negative thoughts only lead to negative things, etc) it is extremely easy to loose sight of that in the daily drama of our lives. I am still noticing the effect this book had on my life when I find myself gossiping less and holding my tongue when I want to be negative and judgmental. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some perspective and hope.  29 book reviews: \"Happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.\" The Toltec wisdom of this book is commonsense which we all have heard, but do not always believe and apply every moment. As I read each section, specific relationships (of mine or others) came vividly to mind, esp. \"negative\" or \"toxic\" people I have had to walk away from; and the ones we ca not leave (family) but can learn not to blame for their sickness. It 's a very quick read, and I plan to re-read it at different stages. I think I will get something different out of it each time.  THE FOUR AGREEMENTS:  BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.  DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you wo not be the victim of needless suffering.  DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.  ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.  ",
    " The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir": "book reviews: What has the country come to if I m marking a book by John Fucking Bolton as  To Be Read ? 1 book reviews: Just as a thought experiment, would you, in 1943, have read a tell-all memoir about Adolf Hitler written by a disgruntled Rudolf Hess?  A. Give my hard-earned money to one of the Nazi Party 's former leaders? Are you crazy?  B. Not read the latest dirt on Hitler? How could I resist?  C. I would have to read it of course, but it would be a stolen copy.  D. I would wait for the Goebbels book, it would be better written and have juicier stories.  E. With Alan Turing 's capable help, I would invent the internet and Goodreads, then review the book without having read it.  2 book reviews: As a Norwegian, I simply find American politics amusing. Why? Because they are not like the politics in Norway. Our \"far-right\" is \"far far left\" compared to the US. We are different from you guys. I find French, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Swedish, and British politics just as amusing because they are different (more similar than the US though).  As Trump would probably tell people that this book is made up of lies and recommend everyone to not read it, I just had to get it and read it. And I did.  Like all political books, it 's a tough, slow and rather boring read to be honest, but it 's still an important enough book for Trump to tweet about it. The book is somewhat, as expected, revealing. If it 's true or not is not up to me to tell, but most of it does fit the description of Trump that we are already used to \"across the pond\".  Personally, I do not see why anyone would spend their time writing this, if it is all lies. It 's not exactly a page turner, but some of the situations described are well worth the read. Would recommend this to people who want a nuanced view on the \"Trump vs. former employees\".  For all the people just making \"reviews\" to complain about Bolton, the Mueller-rapport and Trump and shit or trying to give this book shitty reviews just to stop people from buying it, please ... I beg you .... Fuck off. This is not the place for your shit. Go somewhere else. Any social media or whatever, just not here. This is a \"sacred\" place to some, so please respect it.  I wrote my first review because you guys pissed me off.  3 book reviews: I suppose it was the fact that President Trump was so set against this book being published that sparked my initial interest - what was it that he was trying to cover up? I live in the UK, but I do like to try and educate myself as to what s happening on the other side of the pond. However, am I really doing that by reading something like this? It s difficult to decide what s true here and what isn t to be honest.  I actually had real difficulty in finishing this book, and very nearly gave up altogether - I found it slow and boring, but hey, I d paid 18 of my English pounds, and finish it I would!  Bolton came across as arrogant, full of his own self importance, and why did he stay quiet when it really mattered! Who knows, I may have missed something important, because I admit to doing a fair bit of skimming, but my advice is to save your money, and buy something really worth reading, because for me, this definitely wasn t.  4 book reviews: 2.5 stars, rounded up for now  Update after finishing: I do not feel like I learned a lot, aside from learning that this guy is a pompous ass. He really finds fault with just about everyone ...except himself. Of course he paints the picture of a stupid and incompetent Trump (like I said, nothing I did not already know) but he did not help with the impeachment, nor does he offer his solution to making a Trump a one-term president. Voting for a third candidate (Independent, etc) is not a solution, but a complete waste of a vote. Hopefully he will vote for Biden even if he wo not admit it. Also, the book is boring and would have done well to be about half the length.  Anyway, do not waste your money on this. Borrow it, , read reviews, or whatever. This guy does not deserve to make a dime. ----  Update 6/30: Downrated to 3 stars and I do not expect that rating to go up. I am not liking the author at all. And nothing else really surprises me. Hoping to finish by the end of the week (I just finished chapter 11, so not too far to go).  Update 6/25: Finally reading this and these are my early impressions: Book is boring AF so far. Author is a self-important douchebag.  Nevertheless, I will persist. ----  Pre-release thoughts: What is the world coming to where I find myself reading books written by Republicans??????? But, hey, if Trump wants the book suppressed, I definitely plan to read it. Will I pay my hard-earned money for it? Absolutely not. I will borrow a copy. And I will adjust my rating accordingly after I read it.  5 book reviews: I have decided to embark on a mission to read a number of books on subjects that will be of great importance to the upcoming 2020 US Presidential Election. Many of these will focus on actors intricately involved in the process, in hopes that I can understand them better and, perhaps, educate others with the power to cast a ballot. I am, as always, open to serious recommendations from anyone who has a book I might like to include in the process.  This is Book #27 in my 2020 US Election Preparation Challenge.  Perhaps one of the most anticipated political books of the summer, I chose to leap on the John Bolton memoir before reviews filled Goodreads and other platforms I frequent. Written based on his time working inside the White House, Bolton not only brings first-hand knowledge of events, but also offers insights into what he witnessed during his time as National Security Advisor. With a long history of work within various Republican administrations, John Bolton was not a man wet behind the ears when being considered for a position in the Trump Administration. His experience and hawkish approach to international politicking surely caught the attention of Trump and some of those within his inner circle. Bolton hit the ground running, explaining that every day in the Trump White House is fraught with chaos and ever-changing views on hot button issues. Bolton sought to steer the president in a few directions that would follow policy to support those views that arose in the campaign, at times doing anything to reverse the Obama trajectory. From America s role in the Syrian civil war to Russian involvement on world events, Bolton showed how Trump s opinions would change with the blowing of the wind, wanting America out of military involvement and yet not letting its greatest adversary to think it weak. This Russian sentiment baffled me throughout, as Trump would speak poorly about Putin and yet relied on him to win his seat in the Oval Office. Bolton also explores issues with China at length, clashing with one of the world s economic superpowers at every turn, and yet Trump offered them the chance to keep him in power by  helping  with the 2020 election (a la Putin 2016). Dismantling NATO and contemplating destabilising the leftist Venezuelan autocrat also played heavily on Trump s agenda while Bolton was National Security Advisor, with many offhand and somewhat outlandish ideas coming up regularly before POTUS could be talked away from the ledge. Bolton spends much time throughout the book exploring the Trump view at finally getting some concrete progress with the North Koreans, with in-depth discussions of their two summits and the  love affair  the media explored through the flowery diplomacy that took place, yet nothing substantial came to pass. Of equal interest and importance is the means by which Trump sought to dismantle the nuclear weapons treaty with Iran that had been negotiated during the Obama Administration. Trump seemed keen to change the rules and make sure America came out on top, while making sure that many new how horrible Obama was as POTUS (second only to Bush 43, whom Trump appeared to loathe even more). Bolton is happy to offer blunt views of Trump and those in the know, at times sharing views with other Cabinet officials as they watched the continued implosion of all things Trump. Bolton also sheds light on the constant sentiment that Trump is one who holds firm views of people, fleeting as the interactions change from day to day, including a strong dislike for some of America s greatest allies, while praising those who are firmly in the column of  enemies of the state . Bolton provides some insight into the Ukrainian interactions that fuelled the fire towards impeachment, offering his own ideas from the facts he knew. That Bolton and Trump eventually fell out is of no shock to anyone, as those who refuse to be sycophants are apt to become, but the recent vilification of anything Bolton might have to say only furthers my belief that there are hard truths in this book that many who nurse from the presidential teat would have us deny as a new round of false news. This book is full of detail and great narrative that will be ideal for those who want some additional insights into how the Trump White House ran things, both from an international and domestic perspective. I d recommend this to those who enjoy all things political, as well as the reader who has no trouble hearing truths that may run counter to the POTUS circus.  I have never hidden my dislike of the current American administration, particularly the ringleader of the shenanigans. While I understand that media outlets will offer their own spin on events, I have come to appreciate those on the inside who offer up books about the events they witnessed. Some would call it smear campaigns or falsehoods to trip up POTUS, though I wonder how many people could have colluded with such a similar narrative, as well as what purpose it would serve to exert such energy to bring down a man who seems able to do it on his own. Bolton is by no means a Democrat seeking to dismantle the GOP machine, which only makes some of his views all the more insightful. He offers praise where it is needed and critiques things that seem to lack the insight to keep America from running amok (alas, we are well past that). Bolton does come across as a know-it-all at times, feeling that he is the smartest man in the room and all others should bow to his intellect, which is seen in many tongue-in-cheek sentiments expressed in most chapters, as well as in recollected conversations with others. While that may be the case, Bolton s views are steeped in some well established views of international politics and diplomacy, something that adds to the flavouring of the book and leaves the reader to wonder why someone would purposely skew things that can be substantiated so effectively. With thorough chapters that explore many insightful areas that are sure to pique the interest of the politically minded individual. While some may call Bolton too close to Trump, it is this closeness that offers the reader some of the many views from behind the curtain. Why would someone like Bolton want to find himself on the outside with this book, upsetting POTUS, thereby making him an enemy of the administration? Knowing Trump s penchant for such things, Bolton s better off pissing from outside the tent inwards and letting the truth  hang out .  Kudos, Mr. Bolton, for such a refreshing book about the inner workings of Trump s Administration. I could not ask for anything more!  Love/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:   A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge:  6 book reviews: Where in the hell was all of this when Mueller was testifying? Where was this during the impeachment trial? Bolton had a chance to go down in history as a patriot, instead he ll go down as a footnote.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. 7 book reviews: BOLTON: I am willing to testify if subpoenaed. REPUBLICANS: He 's just trying to sell a book! ME: Then why offer so many damn spoilers? 8 book reviews: Ah, The Room Where It Happened. The title is the coolest thing about this book, borrowed from the infinitely more engaging Hamilton, which actually has art and a point. This is, of course, the tell-all somewhat-redacted account of Trump 's White House from one of his top appointees, John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor for 17 months (aka 47 Scaramuccis: an eternity in Trump 's revolving-door administration if you are not related to him). In it, we get another, closer glimpse inside this disastrous and disorganized presidency. The White House, and Trump himself, now cast aspersion on Bolton and discredit his observations (while simultaneously claiming he 's divulging classified information). Trump calls Bolton \"incompetent\" and a \"boring old fool\", saying \"all he wants to do is drop bombs\". One wonders why he chose Bolton in the first place, and what it says about his leadership and judgment that he fills the swamp as he drains it of figures like John Kelly, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster (Bolton 's predecessor), who all now share the same stories of Trump 's malfeasance. It reminds me of the Church of Scientology, vilifying former members who all seemed to be hunky-dory when they were toeing the party line. Do not feel sorry for Bolton, though. He 's a terrible person who should have never been allowed back in government. It 's hard to root for one of the architects of the Iraq War as you listen to a dangerous idiot recount the faults of an even more dangerous, powerful and idiotic man. Many potential readers feel the dissonance of supporting Bolton, with good reason. Plus, this information would have been far more helpful many months ago when House Democrats asked Bolton to testify in the Trump impeachment proceedings (more on that bit of hypocrisy later). Trump is at least right that Bolton is profoundly boring, which this 500-page-plus (21 hours by audio) plod makes clear. Bolton uses his moment in the spotlight to regale us with the minutia of his tenure and decision making, when all anyone really cares about is the dirt to be dished on Trump. The dirt is there, but isolated in a sea of unnecessary details and negotiations with Venezuela and Turkey that no one asked for. My advice? You will get all the information you need from news reports and this handy-dandy review.  Bolton starts by describing his White House courtship, which began as early as the transition. Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner and others would loop Bolton into discussions, sneak him in and out of meetings, and propose roles for him in the coming administration. Bolton was holding out for Secretary of State or National Security Advisor, not content with playing second-banana. Trump liked Bolton, even expressing surprise that Bolton was more hardline than himself on many issues. Of course, we the public wondered why Trump would even consider Bolton, since Trump tried so hard during his campaign to pretend he had been against the Iraq War, and stated regularly his disdain for both of the Bushes. Bolton suspects that Trump simply never understood his role in those administrations (probably correct) and just liked what he heard from Bolton on Fox News. Other sources have said that Trump held off on giving Bolton first-pick because he did not like his mustache. Bolton claims Trump told him he liked the mustache, because Trump 's father had a mustache. I think we all know the resale value on a compliment from Trump. Bolton loves compliments, though, and if anyone says anything nice about him, you will hear about it in this book. The same goes for criticisms, which Bolton similarly views as compliments - he 's happy to piss off his adversaries, and claims his \"scar tissue has scars\". Even at this early courtship stage, Bolton could see signs of poor leadership, communication and team building: unsupervised and conflicting philosophies with no clear chain of command to resolve differences. He admits that he fell sway to the illusion that he could succeed in imposing order where others had failed. In standard fashion, he got confirmation that he would been hired at the same time everyone else did: in a tweet from Trump. And so, following Michael Flynn (convicted of felony) and H.R. McMaster (forced out over disagreements), John Bolton became Trump 's third National Security Advisor.  The room where it happened (as evidenced by the jacket design) was typically \"The Oval\", as Bolton repeatedly refers to the Oval Office (112 times, to be exact). I do not know how common that phrasing is in presidential parlance, but I kept whispering the missing \"Office\" in my head. Once Bolton is hired, we get treated to the palace intrigue as various scandals break out, administration members get frustrated or fight each other, and as Trump endangers the entire nation with his lack of preparedness or even basic knowledge of the world stage. There are multiple attestations of administration members declaring their derision for Trump. Tillerson called him \"a fucking moron\". Pompeo passed Bolton a note during a North Korea discussion saying \"He is so full of shit.\" Mattis formed part of the \"axis of adults\": administration members fighting to keep Trump from destroying the world by ignoring his orders and hoping he would forget about them (he often would), keeping him in the dark on certain topics, or giving him a set of options psychologically tailored to produce the desired illusion of choice. Bolton clearly dislikes Mattis, and resents what he sees as manipulation of the President. And yet, Bolton comes to do the exact same thing throughout the book. Bolton is able to confirm another piece of intrigue: Nikki Haley (who Bolton clearly despises) was seriously considered as a replacement for Mike Pence as VP in the 2020 election. Trump encourages skirmishes and back-biting, as long as he is not the target. He asks Bolton to dish dirt on other members, which \"almost no one believed was conducive to building trust and confidence among his subordinates\".  Trump gets certain ideas stuck in his head, and once they are in there, no facts can shake them loose. Bolton spoke of numerous diatribes, such as Trump obsessing over Germany not paying for its share of defense spending (everything comes down to America getting \"ripped off\", and Trump does not want to pay for anything unless he see an immediate financial advantage). Another oft-repeated harangue is Trump 's insistence that John Kerry should be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act (for talking to Iran), no matter how often Bolton tried to explain why that is a non-starter (plus, take a look at Rudy Giuliani if you are worried about the Logan Act). Trump is pathologically anti-Obama, and anything or anybody he associates with Obama needs to be repealed or fired (Bolton seems happy to jump on this bandwagon, and does not seem to taste the irony of bashing Obama in a book detailing Trump 's failure to meet basic presidential standards). Trump goes off on these rants at times and places when they are entirely inappropriate, such as in front of other country 's leaders, or when Trump is supposed to be taking in information. He similarly reveals his ignorance in international meetings, expressing surprise that Britain is a nuclear power, going off on a rant about Pearl Harbor when preparing for a meeting with Prime Minister Abe, suggesting that Venezuela is part of the US, and asking, \"Is not Finland kind of a satellite of Russia?\" When corrected, Trump often repeats the misconception later. It 's almost as if he 's incapable of learning. Lack of preparation is another refrain. Trump 's schedule begins at 11 AM (!!!) at the \"Oval\", though Bolton insists Trump spends the morning making phone calls. He shows up late, does not prepare, does not read notes, does not listen to briefings, does not absorb carefully prepared security documents (short, visual content is preferred), and dominates conversations. As Trump says, \"I am a talker, I like to talk.\" He regularly jumps on calls with the heads of other countries unprepared, and does not seem to understand the significance of a call from the President of the United States, nor the fact that such calls are supposed to have objectives. He then proceeds to embarrass all of us by talking about unrelated issues: usually himself. Bolton is rightly worried that other, more intelligent, world leaders use this to actively take advantage of Trump and the US, and he points to multiple instances in which Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un conversationally outplay Trump, exposing his weak intelligence, lack of nuance, and soft spot for flattery. This is especially disconcerting when Trump takes secret meetings with Putin for which we have no notes or record.  The embarrassing interactions with foreign leaders are legion. Trump is aggressive and combative with our allies such as Trudeau and Marcon, and especially women leaders like Theresa May and Angela Merkel. He plays much nicer with our competitors, our enemies, and outright dictators. Trump calls Putin to congratulate him on his \"election\". He tells President Xi that it was the right decision to build internment camps for the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, and jokes with Xi about maybe serving more than two terms as US president. He offers to ease investigations on a Turkish company on Erdogan 's behalf. We all know about his absurd bromance with North Korea 's Kim Jung Un, sending him what even Bolton characterizes as \"love letters\". This was one of the situations in which Bolton tried his best to steer Trump away from his intended dealings, though it 's hard to stop a president who tweets essentially \"meet me at the DMZ\", which then happens. One bizarre interlude involves Trump repeatedly asking Mike Pompeo to deliver a CD of Elton John 's \"Rocket Man\" to Kim Jong Un. Even worse, Trump tries to set up a negotiation with the Taliban! At Camp David! The Taliban! Bolton and others intervene to ensure that the talks fall apart before it actually happens, but Trump takes the embarrassment public by tweeting that the meeting was called off. These are the kinds of things that send the whole White House into a tailspin of damage control. Speaking of which, we get some insight into how Trump reacts to negative coverage, and how he uses outlandish behavior to distract from embarrassing behavior. For example, Trump purposefully defended Saudia Arabia 's assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in an attempt to distract the media from talking about Ivanka 's use of private email to conduct government business (exactly what he wanted to lock up Hillary Clinton for). Another constant thread is Bolton 's bewilderment that presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner is handling back-channel conversations with world leaders. Kushner is constantly doing other peoples' jobs and getting assigned absurdly broad tasks like \"immigration\", \"the China trade issue\", and of course his \"never-quite-ready Middle East peace plan\" that should belong to an experienced, qualified team. Trump complains endlessly that someone is keeping him from talking to other world leaders, which Bolton eventually discovers is Kushner, when Kushner blocks a Trump-seeking call from Israel 's Netanyahu. And, of course... Bolton confirms what he should have testified before Congress: that Ukrainian military aid was directly held up (deliberately, many times) because Trump wanted Zelensky to deliver dirt on Joe Biden. If that is not impeachable enough, we also learn that Trump asked Xi Jinping to help him win re-election in exchange for agricultural quid-pro-quo.  I am adding a lot of my own editorial here. Bolton tells all of this as a series of blandly described events, without providing much in the way of synthesis or objective lesson. Any observations or condemnations Bolton offers Trump are subtle. On one hand, this could be seen as objectivity: Bolton seems freshly surprised with each new Trump disaster, but will also give Trump full credit when he gets something \"right\" by Bolton 's reckoning. Bolton will work hard to distract Trump from leaving NATO, but then turn around and applaud him for unilaterally abandoning some other strategic partnership Bolton does not like. Clearly Bolton is aware of Trump 's malfeasance (I lost count of how many times he was planning to leave the administration over decision x or y), but he ca not seem to muster the courage to condemn it outright or in bold terms. He describes a man who is vain, witless, corrupt and immoral, but wo not call him any of these things. One of the most ignorant statements comes when Bolton muses what could happen if Trump were re-elected: \"...A second-term Trump will be far less constrained by politics than he was in his first term. The irony could well be that Democrats will find themselves far more pleased substantively with a 'legacy'-seeking Trump in his second term than conservatives and Republicans. Something to think about.\" Okay, I thought about it. You are an idiot. To paraphrase another franchise (and confuse houses): you know nothing, John Bolton.  Bolton himself has a lot to answer for, and he does not do it here. He never addresses his failures in the Bush administration (WMDs, anyone?), and for all the opinions he holds forth on America 's role in the world, I never got any sense of what this man 's moral compass is. He brushes off not participating in the impeachment hearings, calling it \"impeachment malpractice\", saying that house Democrats were as irresponsible as Trump in how they handled and tried to rush proceedings. Nonsense. As if that s his decision to make on behalf of the American people. He does not seem to understand the legitimate pressures that necessitated quick action, nor appreciate the role of Trump 's obstruction efforts. It 's kind of rich that Bolton then talks about decisions made to publish this book as quickly as he could, in terms that sound quite similar to Congress 's reasons for hastening the impeachment hearings. Anyway, super boring book. If you made it this far, I hope I saved you a few hundred extra pages of reading.  9 book reviews: I only read 34% of this, I could not do more! Bolton continued to brag about himself and his great ideas. He acted like he was the only adult in the room, even above the generals. Those great ideas were the idiot plans I had previously attributed to Jared or other severe right wingers. Now I know! He also bashed Obama 's plans and how they needed to go down. He still is a war hawk and wanted to bomb the hell out of things. He has enough blood on his hands from the Bush administration to last a life time! I had bought the audible book so if I did not like the book I could return it, real perk!  10 book reviews: He would not testify. I wo not be opening my purse. You? 11 book reviews: No, I am not done yet. Not even close.  Rarely do I wrote a book review of a book I have not finished.  But it needs to be done. This book by Bolton is gigantic. It will take me awhile to finish it. I will read it at my leisure.  But as anyone who knows me knows..I do not like Trump.  Originally I was not going to buy this because I think Bolton is a coward who cares more about profit then doing the right thing.  But..he 's still way better than Trump.  And I am curious.  And Trump does not want people to buy the book. Says it may have classified information. So, I want it. The book I mean. And I want to rate it a perfect five even if it is not.  That 's how childish I am! Anyone who screws Trump over..well..they ca not be all that bad.  Besides, the book could be pulled any day and I want to read all the Classified stuff and all the writings Trump does not want us to see.  The book I just reviewed before this one is all about the power of the mind..let 's all of the Never Trumpers try to see in our minds Trump losing the election in November. And I want Biden to win Mississippi.  Will do a proper review when who le book is finished. But it 's pretty good so far!  12 book reviews: Audiobook...Biography/memoir ...narrated by Robert Petkoff. ...John Bolton reads his epilogue.  ...There are professional reviews.... ...There is the publishers summary.... and ...Other readers who are much more qualified to review this book, than me. ...Seriously scholars, political geeks, history buffs... don t need my unqualified review. That said... ....I listened to 20 hours and 52 minutes-  knowing  I wasn t understanding half of it. But.... ...Half of it I did!  I figure my half-ass-effort of listening/ understanding this book still counts or something. Some of it went right over my head.  But.....  ITS A FRICKEN DISASTER inside the White House... A FRICKEN FRIGHTENING NIGHTMARE!!!  I felt it took  forever  for John Bolton ( in chapter 1), to explain his process of getting hired by Trump as the national security advisor. Bolton worked for Fox news. Trump kept telling Bolton that they shared the same views. Trump wanted Bolton inside the White House so -in part - he could control - dictate - what he wanted said on Fox News. Why else is all other news FAKE? Trump can t control other networks.  Now that I ve finished this book - it makes more sense to me now  why  Bolton took extra time in having us see how  grueling  ( felt grueling to me), it was before he had an official job [ with an inbox], in the White House. Basically... nothing seemed easy... But it never looked liked Bolton was begging for a job from Trump. ... not from what he wrote. It was Trump who was constantly going after Bolton.  Since this book has come out - Trump  tweeted   For a guy who couldn t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago, couldn t get approved for anything since,  begged  me for a non Senate approved job, which I gave him despite many saying  don t do it, sir  NOT TRUE! Red flags were going up ABOUT TAKING THE JOB -  before  Bolton took it- spending 453 days on the payroll. How he lasted 453 days -is beyond me.  When Bolton tried to advise Trump on National security issues...they didn t agree...( especially over a deal with Afghanistan) and other foreign affairs. Trump wanted to allow leaders of the Taliban to visit Camp David in just days before the anniversary of the 911 terrorist attacks to finalize peace talks. The idea was strongly opposed by Bolton. Bolton and Trump also disagreed about striking in Iran. Trump  strongly  didn t agree with Bolton > so....... Trump fired him. That s 3 national security advisors fired by Trump! Guess Trump wants a puppet for an advisor.  I don t think Bolton is a peach-of-a-man - squeaky clean himself - but even though I had to slog through his book- I thought parts were revealing and interesting ( in a juicy gossip type of way). Reading about Bolton s very first day on the job was like a horror-comedy act from Saturday Night Live. Things were chaotic-  really  chaotic. The crisis in Syria was horrific; overpowering all other government business in the White House Bolton survived his first day... His first 4 days sounded like a nightmare. My guess - very few days were easy-breezing.  Mostly ... this book was too  detailed  for the average reader .... I understand the importance, but it was too tedious to read. Dates, time of day, and number of minutes for every meeting, every conversation, page after page, just gets tedious to read! Like I said... I understand the reasoning of documentation... But it was TOO MUCH!!!  The New York Times said,  the memoir was  bloated  with self-importance, even though what it mostly recounts is Bolton not being able to accomplish very much . I AGREE... Guess that s it for my review! The end!!! ( haha)  The elephant in the room - ( the guy hidden behind the wizards curtain).... Yep..., no surprise... is Trump!!  Trump is arrogant- is not stable - and he definitely rigged the last election.... WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT HE DOESN T succeed again!!!  Bottom line: VOTE IN NOVEMBER.... But NOT for Trump!          13 book reviews: I did not enjoy this book. In many ways, I wished I had not read it. I guess I am tired of reading about an out of control two-year-old playing in the White House and disgracing the country. Prior to this it never bothered me who was in control of the government. I just figured the rotation back and forth between conservatives and liberals kept the country more or less in balance, until now.  I did not learn anything new in this book, but it reinforced what other books have said. It did provide more inside information on what was happening at any given time in the White House. Bolton comes off as an arrogant know-it-all obsessed with Iran. Bolton s information only confirms my opinion that Trump will see a second term as a welcome mat to become a dictator and dissolve our democracy. Sorry this is not my usual neutral review. I guess I am tired and fed up.  I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is twenty hours and fifty-two minutes. Robert Petkoff does a good job narrating the book. Petkoff is an actor and audiobook narrator. He has won the Audie Award and multiple Earphone Awards.    14 book reviews: While I will never forgive Mr. Bolton for staying quiet when it mattered, I am quite confident that everything in the book is accurate and at least it is in time to help Trump lose the election.  Those who refuse to believe it are simply continuing to lie to themselves about the huge mistake they made in 2016.  It 's not too late to wake up and snap out of it. Or, if you are fully aware and STILL support this traitorous president, it 's never too late to re-grasp your lost conscience and turn your life around.  Just. Do. It.  15 book reviews: I wanted to read this book for two reasons:  1). As a United States citizen who cares about my country, I feel it is my duty to be as informed as possible.  2). Trump 's little hissy fit over the book piqued my interest and I wanted to find out what 's so bad that we do not already know.  I ca not though. I just cannot do this book. I read a few pages but Bolton 's arrogance just oozes out of the Kindle.  I ca not stomach it for 652 pages, not if I want to retain my sanity. And I do.  Whatever it is that trump wanted so badly to keep from going to the press will have to remain a mystery to me... at least until I read some other reviews from stronger people who can get through this ego trip of a book.  My uninformed conclusions upon reading this book but having paid attention for the last four years:  1) Trump does what he wants, when he wants, without thinking things through and regardless of the constitutionality of his acts.  2) Trump will do much more of this the longer he is in power.  3) Trump 's unconstitutional display of power against protestors in Portland, Oregon is just the beginning.  4) Trump has no concern for human life unless it is his own. None.  5) Get the hell out and vote in November. Vote Blue. If you vote third party, you are effectively voting trump. If you care about your country and do not wish to live under a dictator, vote Blue.  DNF'ed at page 10.  16 book reviews: I got my hands on an advance copy and read it. Anyone who 's bothering to read Goodreads reviews surely has already seen the leaked substance, so I wo not repeat that here. What I will say is that Bolton comes across incredibly poorly in this tome (and I have no love lost for anyone in this administration): 1) His ego is endless. He has seemingly written down every piece of shameless/shameful flattery any person has ever uttered to him, and recounts all of them here, clearly tickled at all of them and taking them seriously. (Meanwhile, he endlessly talks about his clever stratagems of getting in people 's heads with provocative tweets or speeches; it seemingly does not occur to him that some of this flattery might be less than gospel.) 2) He is incredibly petty. There is no slight so small that he 's not willing to square it here; very early in his NatSec tenure, Mike Pence acts as chair/convenor of a meeting; Bolton makes sure we all know what a grievous etiquette failure that is and that Bolton made sure that did not happen again. Good to know you are focused on the big picture, John. 3) His pettiness seems actively misogynistic when it comes to women. While he clearly thinks he 's smarter than pretty much everybody else he encounters in his work life, his descriptions of women who work in the White House (Nikki Haley, Kristjen Njielsen) are particularly venomous, and gratuitously cruel. What exactly is the point of repeating a sexist slur Trump tells him Tillerson used to describe Haley to her face, particularly if Bolton does not know that it happened, other than to humiliate Haley in print? And Haley and Njielsen are relentlessly derided for their lack of intellectual firepower and strength of will, in ways and words that are stronger than say, his criticisms of Jared Kushner or Steve Mnuchin. His description of the FLOTUS staff as sorority mean girls seems tellingly trivializing. 4) He 's even more of a chickenhawk than I realized (and I remember being appalled by UN Ambassador Bolton during the GWB years). The number of treaties he salivates getting out of, or fantasizes getting out of because of their sheer pointlessness, had me looking for a treaty he would actually defend (either in history or now) I could not find one in this 500 page book. 5) He lacks all self-awareness. At one point, he recounts himself describing James Mattis (who he seems particularly to resent, along with the other generals who serve in the administration. I suspect it has to do with the chicken side of his chickenhawkery) as \"having a high opinion of his own opinion,\" and being good at not doing what the President wants him to. Both of those things clearly apply to Bolton himself, as *his own book* amply demonstrates, but I see no evidence that he recognizes this (or any other meaningful character weakness). And the fact that Bolton describes a White House where pretty much *everybody* is good at not doing what the President wants them to do, or manipulating the President for their own ends, that ultimately makes this book such a sour read. I have long thought that this Presidency reminded me of the late years of Henry VIII 's reign, but that still gives the President too much credit. While Henry was whimsical, vengeful and consumed by rivalries and intrigues, he could still remember what he thought from day to day, and track when advisors had not done as he would asked.  17 book reviews: Lack of space prevents my including a total array of pictures here. To see the review with all the pics, go to my blog: https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....      When Donald Trump was elected President in 2016, he sought to get John Bolton - Republican political consultant, television commentator, writer, and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations - into his Administration.    Trump wanted Bolton on board at least in part because the commentator - a conservative hawk who seems ready to bomb any country he sees as the enemy - is an effective mouthpiece on Sunday morning talk shows, touting Republican views.  Trump and his staff waved a variety of 'consultant' positions in front of Bolton 's nose, but the former Ambassador was not interested. He wanted a job with some clout, and finally became National Security advisor in April, 2018.     Bolton resigned seventeen months later, in September, 2019 - frustrated with Trump 's erratic Presidency and tendency to elevate his personal interests above those of the country.  Upon leaving the government Bolton wrote this book, which is an extensive account of his time in the Trump Administration. Bolton provides detailed accounts of meetings with Trump, cabinet members, and bureaucrats in the United States, as well as with their counterparts in other countries. Bolton also expounds his views on US foreign policy, other members of the Trump Administration, and the President himself. Bolton 's assessment of foreign leaders is telling and a little gossipy - like the times South Korea 's President Moon Jae-in tried to insinuate himself into meetings between Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.  The book is well-organized, clear, and engaging, though a bit bloated - especially with travel details (I took Marine One; I flew on Air Force One; I rode in The Beast; The motorcade drove us to our hotel; My Secret Service guard drove me to the White House; etc.) Bolton is smart, well-educated, and well-read, and he sprinkles his narrative with quotes from notable figures. (Bolton may just have a big book of quotes, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt  ). The former National Security Advisor is also confident and self-assured - a man who thinks he 's always right, and does not mind saying so.  Bolton 's conceit put him at odds with other members of the Administration, especially Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, U.N. Ambassador Nicki Haley, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trump advisor (and son-in-law) Jared Kushner, and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani - all of whom had views and goals that did not necessarily line up with Bolton 's.  Moreover, Trump himself often side-stepped (or disregarded) Bolton 's advice, leading to much frustration for the National Security Advisor. For instance, Bolton wanted to maintain a hard line - and often severe sanctions - against troublesome nations like Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela, while Trump hoped to make deals that helped his eternal re-election campaign. In fact Bolton cites many occasions when Trump had to be 'walked back from the ledge' before he gave away the store.  On the other hand, Bolton wanted to give assistance to Ukraine, while Trump insisted that Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelensky open an investigation into Hunter Biden first - a 'tit-for'tat' issue that eventually led to the impeachment hearings.  Two of Bolton 's other bugaboos are the press, which he disdains, except for Fox News and the like; and the Obama administration, which apparently never set a foot right in his view.  The juiciest parts of the book have already been extensively quoted in the media, but there 's plenty more 'good stuff' in the narrative. The following quotes demonstrate some of Bolton 's views.    Referring to press coverage of Trump 's desire to get the United States out of Syria, Bolton writes: \"All this confused press coverage reveals both the inconsistencies within Trump 's own thinking, and reporting based on second- and third-hand sources, exacerbated under a President who spent a disproportionate share of his time watching his Administration being covered in the press. It is difficult beyond description to pursue a complex policy in a contentious part of the world when the policy is subject to instant modification based on the boss 's perception of how inaccurate and often-already-outdated information is reported by writers who do not have the Administration 's best interests at heart. It was like making and executing policy inside a pin-ball machine, not the West Wing of the White House.\"    Following a description of President George H.W. Bush 's meticulously organized schedule, Bolton says: \"I would have thought I had died and gone to heaven to have such an orderly approach to preparing for an upcoming day. As it was, Trump generally had only two intelligence briefings per week, and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.\"    About attempting to organize a coordinated approach among government departments to Chinese phone company ZTE, which engaged in criminal behavior, Bolton says: \"[The departments] would all rather take their chances with the existing policy-making roulette rather than follow process discipline. The only conclusion to emerge clearly from this moment was that international economic policy remained utterly unstructured, and this was unlikely to change without superhuman effort, not to mention a President who agreed such change would be beneficial.\"    Recalling a conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, Bolton writes: \"[Trump] then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the upcoming US presidential election, alluding to China 's economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he would win. He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. Breezing by China 's failure to do anything on fentanyl [which they manufacture and send to the US] and its seizure of Canadian hostages (not to mention American hostages), Trump urged that the two sides....pursue negotiations to conclude the most exciting, largest deal ever made.\"    Writing about Trumps approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bolton muses, \"With 2020 being a presidential election year, it was inevitable that Trump 's performance in this global health emergency would become a campaign issue, which it did almost immediately. And there was plenty to criticize, starting with the Administration 's early, relentless assertion that the disease was 'contained' and would have little or no economic impact. Market reactions to these kinds of assertions were decidedly negative, which may finally have woken the White House up to the seriousness of the problem....Trump 's reflex effort to talk his way out of anything, however, even a public-health crisis, only undercut his and the nation 's credibility, with his statements looking more like political damage control than responsible public health advice.\"    Referring to the US putting pressure on Iran and Trump 's determination to leave the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton says: \"Trump invariably believed our allies were not doing enough. This was certainly true on Iran. France, Germany, and the UK spent their time trying to save the Iran nuclear deal rather than pressuring the ayatollahs. Neither they nor Americans who supported Obama 's deal ever believed unilateral US sanctions could devastate Iran 's economy, although that was exactly their effect....Had we hard-liners persuaded Trump to bear down on [Treasury Secretary] Mnuchin, we would have seen even more economic decline in Iran, but that was not to be. Trump could initiate policies, but his lack of consistency, steadfastness, and resolve invariably undercut them.\"    Musing about Trump 's views that he was being undercut by his own advisors, Bolton writes: \"Trump often complained that people all over the world wanted to talk to him, but somehow they never got through.....Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wanted to talk, Putin wanted to talk, everyone wanted to talk to Trump, but someone was cutting him out. Of course, neither Putin nor Rouhani had made any effort to contact us, and to the extent [Iran 's Foreign Minister] Zarif and others spoke to the media, they were playing to Trump 's vanities. The latest variation on this theme, perfected by [North Korea 's Supreme Leader] Kim Jong Un, was to criticize Trump 's aides, presumably to convince Trump only he could make a difference.....Such an approach was quite astute, because that 's exactly what Trump thought.\"    Discussing Trump 's view that former Secretary of State John Kerry was trying to save the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton observes: \"As was often the case when discussing Iran, Trump raised John Kerry. Trump was obsessed with the idea of prosecuting Kerry for violating the Logan Act, a rarely invoked 1799 law prohibiting private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. Without doubt, Kerry was trying to persuade Iran to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.....That said, prosecuting him was a nonstarter. The Logan Act violates the First Amendment and, as a criminal statute, is unconstitutionally void for vagueness.\"    Referring to the downing of an expensive US drone, which Bolton thinks deserved a harsh response, the author recalls: \"A US MQ-9 Reaper drone had been shot down near Hodeida in Yemen, by a surface-to-air missile likely fired by the Houthis (an Islamic group) or Iranians from Houthi territory.....As it turned out, we did nothing, in large part because the military insisted we were uncertain who had actually shot the Reaper down. My assessment could not have been more to the contrary.....We were not trying criminal cases in court. We were in a messy real world where knowledge was always imperfect. Of course, that real world also includes bureaucrats expert at ensuring they do not do what they do not want to do, which was an especially powerful problem with a President whose views sometimes zigzagged hourly.\"       Writing about the Administration 's February, 2020 deal with the Taliban, which Bolton deplores, the author says: \"I tweeted my opposition that morning, 'Signing the agreement with the Taliban is an unacceptable risk to America 's civilian population. This is an Obama-style deal. Legitimizing the Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al Queda terrorists, and to America 's enemies generally.'.....Time will prove who is right, and the full effects of the deal may not become apparent until after Trump leaves office. But there should be no mistaking this reality: Trump will be responsible for the consequences, politically and militarily.\"    Talking about the situation in Ukraine, Bolton notes: \"Ukraine seems an unlikely place as a battleground to imperil an American presidency, but that is exactly what happened in 2019....Throughout my West Wing tenure, Trump wanted to do what he wanted to do, based on what he knew and what he saw as his own personal interests. And in Ukraine, he seemed finally able to have it all.\"    Speaking of Trump 's tendency to placate dictators, Bolton says: \"I wanted to brief Attorney General Barr on Trump 's penchant to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked, such as [downplaying] the criminal case of Halkbank (a Turkish bank charged with violating sanctions against Iran), ZTE (a Chinese phone company that engaged in criminal behavior), potentially Huawei (a Chinese company accused of stealing trade secrets), and who knew what else. Barr said he was very worried about the appearances Trump was creating.\"    Making excuses for not testifying during Trump 's impeachment hearings, Bolton says: \"From the very outset of proceedings in the House of Representatives, advocates for impeaching Trump on the Ukraine issue were committing impeachment malpractice. They seemed governed more by their own political imperatives to move swiftly to vote on articles of impeachment in order to avoid interfering with the Democratic nomination schedule than in completing a comprehensive investigation....[This] provided no opportunity to explore Trump 's ham-handed involvement in other matters - criminal and civil, international and domestic - that should not properly be subject to manipulation by a President for personal reasons - political, economic, or any other.\" (Note: As much as I hate to admit it, Bolton makes a good point here.  )       Speaking of Trump 's attempts to thwart publication of this book, Bolton observes: \"Trump behaved typically, directing the seizure and withholding of my advisors' personal and other unclassified documents, despite numerous requests for their return; obstructing my Twitter account; and outright threats of censorship. His reaction thus ranged from the mean-spirited to the constitutionally impermissible. My reaction....my response? Game on.\"  The book is 576 pages long, and covers Bolton 's view of many additional topics, such as: Trump 's obsession with making NATO countries - especially Germany - pony up more money; US attempts to help replace President Nicol s Maduro of Venezuela; the US not bombing Iran to retaliate for destroyed drones (contrary to Bolton 's advice); Trump 's desire to get America out of Syria and Afghanistan; the overabundance of 'adults' in the foreign service, who value diplomacy over fighting (Bolton would rather fight); Trump 's insistence that South Korea pay more for the US base there....and more.  Whether you are a fan of Bolton or not, the book is worth reading.  18 book reviews: While I m not exactly a fan of Bolton s, I do appreciate how thorough his  tell-all  is - despite coming short of telling all. My guess after reading this, that telling all would require an entire set of encyclopedias, several bottles of aspirin and excessive quantities of alcohol.  I cannot offer a comprehensive theory of the Trump Administration s transformation because none is possible. Washington s conventional wisdom on Trump s trajectory, however, is wrong  Trump was always bizarre, but in his first fifteen months, uncertain in his new place, and held in check by an  axis of adults  he hesitated to act. As time passed, however, Trump became more certain of himself, the axis of adults departed, things fell apart, and Trump was surrounded only by  yes men.    Yes men  who leaving things to go  to Hell in a handbasket  as my grandmother would have said.    Caught by surprise by his  victory  at the polls, Trump s team was not prepared, and Trump  There s another quote, also within the first 1% of this book, that offers another opinion of Trump. Trump often comes off in this, unsurprisingly, more like a whiny toddler threatening a major temper tantrum than presidential. Not exactly shocking news, but there are plenty of other comments from others that support this opinion, as well as note his dangerous incompetence. Shocking, I know   This is a very dry account, with zero entertainment value, or mesmerizingly beautiful writing, it s, as Joe Friday would say,  Just the facts, ma am.  It s politics, and it s written by John Bolton, so don t expect more, but if you re interested in what the future could hold based on the past almost four years, politically speaking, it s worth reading, if for no other reason than it is, indeed, worse than you could ever imagine.  Vote.   19 book reviews: Bolton seems to have kept very detailed notes so this is a blow by blow description of the chaotic decision-making with respect to various crises. Nothing new here, just more of the background.  I don t agree with anything this man stands for. His views are appalling. His Trump enabling was despicable. He did nothing to help us get rid of Trump through impeachment. So now he wants our money in exchange for his sharing his negative views of Trump. Well, most of us were smart enough to recognize Trump s deficiencies before the election. (Although we didn t know that his narcissism and stupidity would actually kill a lot of us.) So Bolton really has nothing to offer us, and he didn t get my money. He didn t even dish juicy dirt about the administration. I m always willing to hear more of that. This book is really dull and it s author is a smug, pompous, arrogant asshole, just like his former boss. May we please never again have a Republican president, if for no other reason than to keep Bolton and his ilk out of government jobs.  20 book reviews: I received a free copy of this book. And after reading it I can say I paid a fair price.  The author is a pompous blowhard. And that makes reading this poorly written book very difficult. He cannot string more than three sentences together without bragging about himself in an unrelated matter.  His arrogance is titanic. I use that metaphor on purpose. This is a guy who thought going to work for this president would turn out well. History speaks for itself on that. And no one with common sense would have predicted otherwise.  Oh, but he did get a book deal for his service. Here is that book. And it s jammed full of things everyone already knew before reading this book. To wit:  (NO SPOILER ALERT BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW ALL OF THIS)  - Jared has too much power - Trump does not read, doesn t get stuff - Trump really really doesn t get foreign policy - Foreign leaders manipulate Trump - Trump is hot for Putin - Trump blessed Xi 's concentration camps  Okay, maybe the blessing of the PRC s Human Rights Criminality is a new piece of information. But it is in no way surprising.  This is not a good read. It is not educational. It adds nothing new. It is poorly written. And author   like most of the characters in the story   is a coward out to profit from his cowardice. I would have given this minus (negative) stars if it were possible.  21 book reviews:                                  .                        .                                  !

Bolton 's perspective comes with the assumption he is the smartest person in the room. Everyone else is a dummy, inexperienced, or otherwise lacking the ability to perceive the nature of evil in the world. That may be what he is going for, but he just comes off as a monstrous, spiteful, warmongering chickenhawk. All of his choices rely on using sticks, and he has no flexibility at all. Therefore, as a diplomat, he is a useless ass, but there is such a lack of self-awareness that you watch him patting himself on the back with \"clever\" tactics to avoid responsibility and accountability, dodging here and there, always aiming higher, always just a little bit short, mostly because he is entirely untrustworthy and vile, though he trumpets himself a patriot. Along the way, he takes down a whole group of diplomats who are catty to a fault. In the end I really wonder what any of them are doing in government.  That being said, some come off better than others, but the fact we perceive them through the distorted Bolton lens (where his own image is so blurred) lends them no credence. He did keep good notes, however, which would be terrible news for Trump 's team, except the book is also such an overwhelming self-indictment of Bolton and his terrible judgment. Do his opinions matter at all? I do not think so. Trump, fwiw, comes off as you likely expect: a man of no morality who is fixed primarily on the public 's perception of himself, without genuine beliefs, malleable to a fault, hilariously disloyal, and astonishingly unintellectual.  I hate what this book says about America, but I cannot one-star the book, despite the narrator 's self-absorption. I think it is important people read it, because clearly half of America 's voters are brainless too. No matter how you feel about Trump (I abhor him), I strongly feel people like Bolton should never be in government. He is a dangerous man who happily has no power anymore and, I hate to admit it, Bolton being out of government is to Trump 's credit. :-( That Trump also hired him (after such a long romance when his defects would be glaring) and thought Bolton 's ideas worthy at all tells us much about how empty of brains is the room where it happened.  23 book reviews: In all candor I debated whether to purchase and read John Bolton s new memoir THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED: A WHITE HOUSE MEMOIR. Apart from stealing the title from a song from the Broadway show  Hamilton  I believe that Bolton s approach is about maximizing his book royalties rather serving democracy, something he claims he has done throughout his years in government service. By eschewing an appearance before the House Impeachment hearings for his own self-serving interests is rather hypocritical and Bolton showed his true colors. In the past whether arguing for an invasion of Iraq or other foreign adventures one at least saw a man whose beliefs were clear, in the present instance I wonder except for the fact that his reputation for never finding a war he didn t like remains. After reading Bolton s somewhat self-serving memoir one gets the feeling that had people listened to him the world and the United States would be in a better place. This is somewhat arguable as I am trying to evaluate Bolton s book in a measured and objective manner, but it is difficult.  Much of the book is about finding fault with others particularly former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and former Chief of Staff John Kelly who make up what Bolton refers to as  the axis of adults.  Though much of the criticisms he points to Bolton always seems to emerge correct, with a little side inuendo about his own views, and nasty comments about the agendas and obstructionism of others. Bolton argues that these men who were supposed to save the country from Donald Trump s most inane actions in reality served him poorly as their approach to reigning him in led to second guessing and conspiracies that undermined what they were trying to accomplish.  After digesting Bolton s 500-page diatribe concerning the Trump administration there is little I disagree with in terms of his insights into the president and his policies or lack of thereof. There is extraordinarily little that is new and surprising if you have been following the last three and half years closely of a convoluted approach to governing and a lack of honesty and forthrightness. Bolton is correct in finding Trump s decision making erratic and unconventional seeing activity in the West Wing as that of a  college dorm  and is amusing when he quotes the Eagles song,  Hotel California  to describe personnel decisions as  you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.  Bolton s sarcasm and dry humor is ever present in the narrative and his writing is somewhat  snappy  and noticeably clear.  Bolton rages against bureaucracies particularly the State Department which never seemed to operate quickly enough for the National Security Advisor and  always seemed to be giving things away.  Bolton s reasons for taking the position in the first place knowing what he did about Trump places him as a member of the  axis of adults  particularly in what transpired later under his watch be it the failure of US Venezuelan policy, trying to control Trump as he upended all norms in his approach to Kim Jung Un, failure to impact Russian policy, trade policies regarding China or events in Ukraine. In every situation and decision Bolton was involved with he would recapitulate his past approaches and knowledge of the issues at hand to reinforce his arguments, i.e., Syrian use of chemical weapons and the American response. He despises James Mattis who he argues was  looking for an excuse not to do much of anything  and refused to cooperate with any action that might be a deterrent to Bashir al-Assad.  To his credit, Bolton s openness in describing certain figures is striking. His commentary is caustic and at times nasty as he goes after South Korean President Moon Ja-in and his  soft  approach to the north. In referencing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he points out how Abe always feared that Trump  would give away the store  in dealing with Kim. This is also clear when describing his fears pertaining to the Helsinki Summit with Vladimir Putin as he wrote,  I was not looking forward to leaving him alone in a room with Trump.   When boiling down Bolton s opinion predictably his most virulent commentary focuses on Trump as anything the president seemed to want, summits with Kim, Putin, Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan, or Chinese President Xi Jinping became exercises in damage control. The media has made it clear over the last three and half years that Trump seems to have this obsession with dictators and government leaders he jealously views as  strong men.  However, as Bolton correctly points out Trump has no understanding of these  strongmen.  They have figured out how to flatter Trump and manipulate him. In reference to Erdogan, Trump could never quite comprehend that he was a radical Islamist who supported the Moslem Brotherhood, helped finance Hamas and Hezbollah, and was anti-Israel. But this did not stop Trump from abandoning the Kurds who were our allies in fighting ISIS at the behest of the Turkish president.  Trump was further obsessed with withdrawing American troops from the Middle East and Afghanistan, constantly pointing out that NATO allies were not carrying their own weight, building his border wall and on and on. If one word is used by Bolton repeatedly to describe the Trump administration it is  dysfunctional,  and his commentary just reinforces Trump s lack of fitness for the presidency. The lies build on other lies producing policy that supported Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammad Bin-Salman who was responsible for the murder of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi because of a large arms deal with the Saudis which was in the interest of American national security among many examples.  Bolton describes a president flailing about making new threats every day, taking away security clearance away from former CIA head John Brennan, his behavior surrounding the death of John McCain, his handling of immigration-putting children in cages, and of course his total lack of leadership and falsehoods pertaining to the Covid-19 crisis. But in making these criticisms Bolton seems to never fail to pat himself on the back. In reference to the Venezuelan crisis he writes,  The regime wonders if the US military threat is credible, but they are most afraid when John Bolton starts tweeting. Now that was encouraging!   In reference to trade negotiations with China and other controversial issues over and over Trump would have people argue to try and reach decisions. Resolution was rare and even worse according to Bolton one day there would be one outcome, then the next day another, and possibly even an hour later Trump would tweet something that would undermine the process. In reference to Covid-19 Bolton remarks that  the NSC biosecurity team functioned exactly as it was supposed to. It was the chair behind the Resolute (Trump s desk) that was empty.  Bolton s description comes across as if he were guiding a child prone to tantrums when he did not get his big deal with China etc., but what he was most afraid was that after abandoning the Kurds, Taiwan could be next. Bolton repeatedly points out Trump s lack of historical knowledge and perspective which led to lectures but more importantly an inability for Trump to engage material based on the past and had rather negative implications for negotiations in the present, as well as developing sound policy.  It is clear from Trump s own remarks he had no compunction bout asking foreign leaders for help for his reelection in 2020. Remarkably during negotiations with Xi  he then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he d win. He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.  Further, the reference to a Trump tweet that led to a meeting with Kim at the Korean DMZ Bolton s view is clear in reference to the president,  he couldn t tell the difference between his personal interests and the country s interests.   It is interesting that Bolton left the details of the Ukraine debacle to the end of the book hoping to maintain the reader s interest. His chapter dealing with Ukraine possesses a great deal of detail, but his commentary is somewhat verbose and does not get to the core of the evidence as he hides behind his own bewilderment. His excuse for not testifying is that it would not have made a difference because Republicans in the Senate would never have voted for impeachment, instead he argues that the House Democratic impeachment leaders committed malpractice and are responsible for their own failure to succeed. Bolton s rationalization does not hold water as his checkbook seemed to be his only driving force.  In the end Bolton s book is a monument to his own ego. He has written a book based on the fastidious notes he has taken providing minute and, in many cases, extraneous information that was not necessary. Bolton does provide some interesting insights and pure gossip, but the book s length and structure leads one to doze at times trying to get through details that were best left on the editor s floor.  24 book reviews: Seems there are indeed hawks that pick out other hawks' eyes.  I could not care less. I never did plan to pay anyway for hawks.  Next! 25 book reviews: If the controversial administration of a one of the most influential countries in the world is trying to make this book disappear, it is going to be a book that I want to support with my $. 26 book reviews: There was a lot of hype when this book first came out. I put in a recommendation with my local library that they purchase the book. When they did purchase it my name was added to the hold list and eventually it became available. I am not sure what the hype was all about. Perhaps this just is not my genre but I thought it was important due to current events. If Donald Trump was afraid of it what was in it?  John Bolton is full of himself. Probably the only person with a bigger ego is Donald Trump. It seems he believes that he is always right and has no problem telling you. He puts down everyone else, Democrats, the media, even other people in the Trump administration (e.g. Steve Mnuchin). He looks down his nose at the media but has no problem appearing on the talk shows.  The book is very comprehensive and does provide detail on the day to day activity in the White House. Bolton talks about North Korea, China, the Iran nuclear deal and Trump 's obsession with prosecuting former Secretary of State John Kerry for violating the Logan Act, Trump 's desire to get the United States out of Syria, Ukraine and Trump 's attempt to base aide on their investigating Hunter Biden, and many other events covered in the media. It is indeed an inside view of what was happening.  This was not an easy read (for me) but I am glad that I read it because it provides some insight into exactly what was taking place in the Trump administration.  27 book reviews: I do not read many comics, but a quick Google search confirmed that in the Batman comics, Penguin and Joker have been known to team up from time to time. In one instance, they escaped from an asylum or prison or something together, only for Joker to, later, intentionally sabotage the plan of taking Commissioner Gordon hostage. This resulted in a standoff that threw the whole plan into chaos and left Penguin passed out on the floor.  If you can imagine Penguin later writing a memoir about that fiasco, then you can probably imagine the tone of by John Bolton. I am not a fan of many of Trump 's policies, so it 's eye-roll-inducing to read about Bolton cheering when something goes  right  in this administration, and lamenting when one of their (in my opinion) awful goals fizzles because of Trump 's unpredictability.  It 's probably not fair to compare Bolton to a supervillain (or Trump, or anyone else in his administration) and, in fact, the mainstream media has a habit of endearing former Trump administration officials. Everyone hates Trump officials when they are in office, and then everyone seems to love those same officials the moment they leave. I am always reminded of that scene near the end of that movie , where Edward Norton baffles Ralph Fiennes into embracing the child he 's taken hostage through insults.         Bolton seems to have missed that loving \"exit embrace,\" thanks in large part to his unwillingness to testify in the impeachment hearings without a subpoena. And now it seems nobody likes poor John Bolton   the left dislikes him because he did not testify, and the right dislikes him because he wrote this book.  For what it 's worth, though, I do not think Bolton minds or ever expected anyone to like him. In fact, speaking of John Kelly in this book, Bolton said, \"I asked him to keep me posted, and he said simply, 'Okay, pal,' which told me he didn t have a lot of friends left at the White House.\"  Yikes.  While I ca not deny I developed a little bit of respect for Bolton 's I-do not-give-a-f***-if-you-like-me attitude, this book was still a thoroughly unenjoyable read. I thought I might go crazy from all the times he mentioned enduring \"eight years of Obama mistakes.\" No treaty, executive order, or deal went unprefaced by his distaste for it, regardless of which administration authored it.  Bolton dislikes EVERYBODY. He insults literally anyone and everyone else in the administration, current and former. Everyone 's an idiot, everyone 's inexperienced, misguided, and wrong-headed. He calls Mnuchin a \"panda hugger,\" for crying out loud.  Further, I was expecting a tell-all book, and was far more interested in National Security. That can be interesting, too, but if someone invites you to a party, you will be pretty disappointed if you show up and discover they meant \"Tupperware party.\" And sure, you might still buy something, but it 's not the beer and pretzels you were expecting.  Since I m at this Tupperware party, I figure I might as well try to get some enjoyment out of it   and Bolton s approach to foreign policy in the Middle East, China, Russia, etc., was at the very least sort of fascinating.  Anyway, when Bolton does talk about Trump, the book is similar to any of the other tell-all books out there, which is a little interesting if for no other reason than the fact that Bolton backs up a lot of the most salacious claims of the last three and a half years, albeit in a dryer choice of words.  His biggest issue was how fickle Trump is. They would get 90% into a process, and Trump would change his mind. Sometimes 100%. He would \"work\" on something, see negative media coverage, and do a 180 on a dime. Or, also common is that Trump 's decisions would be based on how he assumed the media would cover it. Everything was always about reelection, even from day 1. He never had a plan with North Korea, just thought the images of him and Kim Jong-un would play well in the media. Same with any other conversation with any other world leader. One particularly interesting passage was about Trump s first meeting with Kim Jong-un:    Here s another quote that, I feel, displays Trump s priorities:    And here s one that displays Trump s approach to Russia:    The bottom line is the same as any other negative book about Trump s presidency: That doofus stinks, and we should vote him the heck out of there come November. Whereas painted him like an endearing dimwit, and and painted him like a villain, paints him as an unlikable celebrity, who keeps taking bad roles in movies and then berates his various agents and managers for not getting him better work.   28 book reviews: I can like a Washington behind-the-scenes book even if I am not a fan of the person who wrote it. And in the early pages I did enjoy peering behind the curtain. I am not talking about the lunacy of Trump, just the typical way things work behind the scenes in and around the White House. And, although I disagree with Bolton in almost every possible way politically, it is clear he is a smart guy who does his homework.  In the end I could not stomach John Bolton using the potential for Trump scandal as a way to pedal his memoir which would have had a much, much smaller audience if not for that hype. It 's not that he does not give hundreds of examples of Trump 's unfitness to be president, it 's that you have to sit through a whole lot of Bolton baloney to get to it.  But it really is my fault for thinking a memoir would be a tool of righteous opposition to all that is wrong with Trump. Especially when Bolton, despite his weak explanations, chose not to speak when it could have made a difference. Nothing righteous in this lengthy piece of self-aggrandizing, smug, bombast.  ",
    " The Silent Patient": "book reviews: 1 book reviews: This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if not the best, I have ever read.  Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia 's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.  First of all, if you have not read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there 's something to be said for expectations. And there 's no way reading anything about this book would not sway your expectations.  I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It 's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you are reading this, I am so sorry!)  I certainly do not want to do that again. So yeah, I am warning you. Last chance to turn back if you have not read this book.  Okay, now that I am among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I am certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It was not just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.  But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.  The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that did not let go. Once I started, I could not put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.  Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I am so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.  I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It 's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~          2 book reviews: CONGRATULATIONS-Goodreads Choice Awards Mystery & Thriller Winner!  I feel like I should preface my review by stating that I have read A LOT of psychological thrillers, and coupling that with the fact that this was my most anticipated read of 2019 gave The Silent Patient a great deal of pressure. This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did.  The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia 's diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo 's POV.  I ca not really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let 's come back around to the fact that I have been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way before was written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such as , you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of \"includes what we need without being overly winded\".  Unfortunately, I have seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years.  I think I am going to wrap it up here, and please do not let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe.   3 book reviews: Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you will never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that does not do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that does not present misogyny on every page.  The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot does not hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best.  Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as \"crazy\" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in \"a medicated haze\", but the med he names would not cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient 's prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient 's hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients.  All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as \"bitch;\" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal.  I have written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two. Every time someone deletes this book from his or her TBR without reading it, an angel gets his wings.  4 book reviews: As you will see, it s an incredible story of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.  Ohhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz: it is virtually unputdownable.  I did not actually have any plans to read The Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I will tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like \"nope\" and closed on their own.  It 's very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he 's pretty \"fucked up\". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and has not spoken a word since.  Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what 's more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What ca not she say? What wo not she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets.  It 's a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think \"just one more chapter\"). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.  It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there 's enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway. Or it was for me at least.    | | | |  5 book reviews: Alicia Berenson is notorious for an event that happened in the past, but since that horrific incident Alicia has not spoken a word. Theo Farber, a psychotherapist, has heard of Alicia over the years through the news and is delighted when a job opening becomes available that would allow him to work directly with Alicia. Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago?  Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.  Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it was not boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.  Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you have not read it already! Definitely worthy of a reread.  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities    6 book reviews: She tied her husband to a chair and shot him multiple times. Then she slit her wrists and waited for the police to arrive.    At least, that 's what THEY say she did. For her part, Alicia Berenson is not SAYING anything.    When Theo Faber, Criminal Psychotherapist, takes a new job at , he is well aware of their most infamous patient, Alicia Berenson.  She 's the woman caught red-handed after killing her husband, who has remained silent ever since.    In fact, Theo 's primary goal is to work with Alicia. He yearns to get her to reveal what really happened on the night her husband was killed, as he questions the validity of the official story.    Through Theo 's perspective, his investigation, and Alicia 's own diary entries, the Reader is brought along on a hair-raising mystery that is not for the faint of heart.    I this book.  This is the type of Thriller that I really enjoy sinking my teeth into. The use of the diary entries, paired with Theo 's investigations, made for a perfectly-paced reveal in my opinion!    Michaelides is definitely an author to watch. I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next.  Highly recommend!  7 book reviews: Wow, I am still reeling from that ending! A mindblowing, to-die for twist!  A fast read that kept me intrigued from beginning to end, although the shocker came at the end. Wait......wait......what just happened? This was how I felt as a read the last few chapters!  Alicia Berenson is such a mysterious, intriguing character and I was trying to figure her out the entire novel.  I kept asking myself, \"\"She is a famous, talented painter and happily married to her husband, Gabriel. They live in London and have a cozy life.

I was so invested in learning what the circumstances of Alicia 's silence was and had to find out if Theo could save her.  I was not going to read this one, and then requested it on NG and I am really glad I did.  As you can tell, I really enjoyed it! Sure to be a 2019 FAVORITE !  Thanks to Celadon/ NG for my arc. Book is out in Feb 2019 Review posted to blog.  8 book reviews: I hated this book. The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because of course she s fat. Her  grotesque  (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can t find attractive because they re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid are only worth his disdain.  Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn t speak were almost a relief.  Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people.  Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential.  9 book reviews: 10 book reviews: Sorry, could not finish it. Gave it a hundred pages. The story and characters just did not hold my attention. Not enough conflict soon enough. Also, the motivation for why the main character wanted to switch hospitals to handle the woman. It might be explained later in the book as a reveal but for me it weakened the structure. Too much of a slow burn for me. I guess I like a book that has a thriller structure or at least closer to one. For me I need conflict on every page that pulls the reader through the text.  11 book reviews: The beginning hooked me in because I was intrigued to learn more about Alicia 's story, how her husband was murdered, and why she chose to remain silent. However, the book ended up bordering as a cheesy murder mystery, with the main character acting like a white-knight detective who would question a bunch of cartoonish side characters that just outright admit their motivations or feelings about Alicia. The twist was interesting, but a bit shaky - I think it could have been built up in a more believable way.  12 book reviews: (2.5) This was a solid.... meh for me.  I was excited to pick up this psychological thriller because it has been getting some hype but it was a disappointment. Did not care much for the characters, the twist was so obvious, the writing just okay. The only redeeming quality was the audiobook which made it possible for me to finish this book.  Unless you never read thrillers I do not think it 's worth it.  13 book reviews: Not silent enough. 14 book reviews: I gotta stop rating books immediately after I read them and then lower the rating after I process them in detail in my mind and find tons of plot holes 15 book reviews: I am annoyed. 16 book reviews: | | blog | tumblr | ko-fi | |   Please don t let s get dramatic.    I have been a bit hesitant about writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. However since Goodreads allows us to express and our different opinions I do not see any harm in being honest. I did not hate but I did find this both ridiculous and incompetent.

And it was often an ugly sight.\"  And that, my friends, sums up this book perfectly.  Dark psychological suspense is my favorite genre and books like this one are exactly the reason why.  This book is the very definition of a page-turner. From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.  Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.  The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion. I never once felt like I had a grasp on how this story was going to play out, which kept me rapt until the last page.  The blurb on the back cover says that the book has already been optioned for a movie and I would like to put forth my recommendations for casting:  Haley Bennett as Alicia and Oliver Jackson Cohen as Theo (I expect a casting credit)   I received an ARC copy of this book from the publisher. All opinions are my own.  19 book reviews: (Throwback review) Is not it strange that we immensely love and hate a book at the same time? Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.  First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I did not know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars.  This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here.  The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You ca not even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he did not do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.  There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.      The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book.      I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.  It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it \"an unforgettable   and Hollywood-bound   new thriller\" with \"a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy.\" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie.  I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece.  20 book reviews: My thanks to Ben Willis at Orion Publishing Group for sending me a paperback copy of  The Silent Patient  I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange*  Alicia Berenson was discovered standing over her husband - he d been tied to a chair and shot in the face five times. Alicia gives no explanation and refuses to speak. She s admitted to a psychiatric unit,  The Grove  in North London, and six years later she still hasn t spoken - not one single word!  Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has always been obsessed with Alicia s story, and when a position presents itself at The Grove for someone with his qualifications, he applies for the job and is successful. Theo is certain that he can get her to talk, even though others have tried and failed.  Although Alicia is silent, the narrative speaks to us in a way that she can t or won t, throwing the spotlight on the minutiae of her life as a talented artist, and ultimately what led to the events of that fateful night.  Theo s own personal life is laid bare too, and he s also a very complex character - indeed not unlike Alicia. If Theo s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear? Because beneath Alicia s silent exterior, she has plenty to say!  Clever, and compelling, with a humdinger of a twist- I hope the  Silent  Patient  speaks  to you too!  21 book reviews: 4.4/5 Stars     ...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It 's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.    HOLY SHIT! Was not this a mothefucking page turner? Like I literally read and listened to this in 2 home sittings, and 2 subway sittings. Holy motherfuck! I knew this Greek author could do it! . Honestly, all the Greek mentions in this book were porn to me. He wove a whole story so beautifully based on a Greek tragedy, it 's wonderful. Anyone who is Greek in here, read this book. Love me some nice representation!  This book was split into two sections: Theo 's point of view Alicia 's point of view Theo 's point of view is split into two categories... him talking about himself and his wife and him talking about Alicia and himself Alicia 's point of view is seen through her diary  I found myself not as interested in Theo 's chapters about his wife as I was in the entirety of the book. I knew it is the kind of story where this part would actually mean something to the main plot and not just to show us aspects about Theo 's life and his personality, but they were the least interesting chapters for me nonetheless. Apart from that, I just could not for the life of me, stop turning the pages. You all know your girl lost sleep for this. Yes, I motherfucking did.  Was the twist good and unexpected? Yes. Did you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to make it work in your head? Yes. Was it amazing nonetheless? Yes. Listen, it was a really great twist but if Theo had told us from the beginning, it would lose the momentum. I find that a tiny bit weak. But it worked with the story and I fucking loved it ok?  Overall, I loved this book so much. In this review I talked about the two reasons I did not give this book 5 stars but do not let it fool you. This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up. K bye now!  22 book reviews: Were you SILENT or were you SILENCED?   The Silenced Patient   23 book reviews: Alicia Berenson, a famous painter, shoots her fashion photographer husband in the face 5 times, killing him and then never utters another word again. Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, has been obsessed with Alicia and her silence for years and he finally works his way onto the staff of at the Grove, a secure forensic unit and then manages to secure the position of Alicia 's psychotherapist. Very little is really the way it seems in this addictive psychological thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter.  I had so many questions about what was happening and what had happened with both Alicia and Theo. Theo is so ready to lie, manipulate, and use people and even though Alicia was the murderer, think I felt more danger from Theo and his shady practices. And then I was hit with twist at the end of the book, which took me by surprise. I knew something was up but I had not quite figured it out and was thrilled with how the book took me for ride, tripping me up along the way.  Published February 5th 2019  24 book reviews: The thing about this book is that it s only the plot twist.  The story itself is just leadup to it. Everything after it is just explanation. And there s no other substance: no compelling characters, no particularly lovely prose, nothing.  So at least I was surprised by the twist. Otherwise this would have been so infuriatingly disappointing I would have had to put the book over my face and take deep calming breaths in the dark for upwards of 45 minutes.  All of that is to say that this has a very, very, very slow start, and the writing fell very flat for me.  Plus it s not...the woman-hate-y book I ve ever read.  But we all have our things.  Bottom line: Meh.  -------------  i finished this book 3 days ago. i just did not have anything to say about it.  review to come / 2.5? stars  -------------  dear book,  please be scary.  or thrilling.  or plot twist-y.  or surprising.  or something. anything!  love, me  25 book reviews: ***NOW AVAILABLE***   Well looks like I m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the  thrill , or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel.  I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)  One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.  There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.  The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary.  The book takes place in  The Grove  a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly  busy  and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia.  SPOILER ALERT***  Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of  why , why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself.  The twist is a good one but doesn t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I m sure it will come as a surprise to many.  I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed  the debut novel of the year for 2019  as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states \"As you will see, it 's an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"  I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.  26 book reviews: The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication.  When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?  The set- up is instantly intriguing-  Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...  Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery.  Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.  However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.  It is easy to step into Theo s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia s fragile psyche.  But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It s a mind game from start to finish.  Now, about that twist-  The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author s experience or the situation- in my opinion.  In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT S what I m talking about!!  Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake.  The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory.  27 book reviews: 3 to 3.5 stars  I have a few friends that are probably going to wonder why I am not rating this one higher. I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middle  The best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the \"mystery\" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,\"would not it be interesting if . . .\" and that is exactly what happened!  The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.  I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others wo not feel at all. So, do not read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!  Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep. The perfect book for a quick escape. Easy to read and follow the twists and turns. Solid, but not really exceptional.  28 book reviews: WOW... This is a great book.  This is a psychological thriller, and it is one of my favorites. I really did not see the book ending like it did. I cannot say much about this book without giving away to much of the book, but I felt it was a great book with some of the best twist I have read. I think if you did not see the ending coming you will like it, but if you guess the ending will may not like it as much.  29 book reviews: 5  this lived up to the hype  stars!!!  Brilliant! Shocking! Addictive! Mesmerizing!  I m stunned that this is a debut novel. The skillfully scripted storyline, the truly unforgettable characters, the pulse-pounding suspense, the consistently enthralling pace, the enticing narration   all exceptionally fantastic! This was dazzling perfection! The author, Alex Michaelides, has set the bar extremely high for any follow up novels. Wow!  I m going to keep this short and sweet and avoid getting into any storyline details. Bottom line, if you enjoy psychological thrillers, you MUST get your hands on a copy of this. This has easily earned a spot on my 2019 Favourites list! I am eagerly awaiting his next novel!  This was a Traveling Sister read that we all loved.  Thank you to my lovely local library for lending me a copy of this fantastic book!  ",
    " The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz": "book reviews: Erik Larson is my favorite author of nonfiction. He writes books that just grab me as well as always teaching me something new.  Looking back on Churchill, it s easy to assume he was always loved and admired. But that s not the case. He had many detractors on both sides of the pond. Larson does a wonderful job of giving us a flesh and blood Churchill - kimonos and all. His strength lay in being able to give the English hope and a willingness to fight on. After his moving speech about fighting on and never surrendering, he turns to a colleague and says  and...we will fight them with the butt end of broken bottles, because that s bloody well all we ve got.   While Churchill provides the locus of the story, it is much more all encompassing. We learn exactly what England was up against in that first year of war. It s the details that he gives us that stick with me. On the first massive bombing of London, it s the  dust from the age of Cromwell, Dickens and Victoria  that rains down on everyone and covers everything. His choice of quotes are always striking. It s the perfect blend of the monumental facts and the minute detail so that you have a complete picture.  I came away with a much better understanding of what the Battle of Britain was all about. I had not understood how much of England, not just London, was subjected to the horrendous bombing. And it put me in awe of the English ability to withstand such horror.  My thanks to netgalley and Crown Publishing for an advance copy of this book.  1 book reviews: This is splendid, intense, emotional, perfectly crafted and so far one of the best nonfictions I ve read. The author s fantastic talented writing hooks you from the beginning and you see so many similarities about the portrait of Churchill has been adapted into Joe Wright s movie Darkest Hour which has been brought Gary Oldman an Oscar statuette.  We learned so much about Battle of Britain and how British folks  destiny has been sealed by a powerful and fearless leader s smart tactics and powerful political moves. It was like a high tension fast forwarded chess game but unfortunately not only the pawns at risk, the entire country s faith has been depended on great mind s risky but also determined actions.  Especially reading the negotiation parts between Churchill and Roosevelt was illuminating and informative.  I also enjoy Churchill s intimate relationship with his family members, his adorable cat, his eccentric, quirky nature. Clementine was not only his wife but also another greatest mind and strategist to help him look at the facts from other perspectives and of his daughter Mary was joyful, lovely character takes our minds from the war strategies and remind us the beauty of being young and hopeful.  Overall: it s informative, phenomenal, action packed, controversial, breath-taking reading with its well crafted and perfectly portrayed characters that highly recommend to all readers who know the real taste of amazing writing.      2 book reviews: What a poignant read for the times we are in as the world is fighting a different type of war without the guns and bombs and those in government must make the tough decisions to keep us safe. A few Winston Churchills wouldn t go amiss in heading the Governments of today.  Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few (Sir Winston Churchill)  I have always had a for Winston Churchill and was excited when I heard that Erik Larson was writing a book portraying London during the Blitz and focusing on Churchill and his family and friends. I listened to this one on audible and while it s extremely well narrated, it is not my favorite way to read non fiction and history as I am always wondering if the hard copy had maps, or photographs that I may be missing out on.  This is extremely well researched and written account and takes you right into those air shelters in London and the terror and fear that the majority of British folk faced during the war, I leaned so many facts and figures concerning the battle to save Britain and the early years of the war. I loved this take on Winston Churchill where his confidence, leadership and eccentricities shine through. When a country is facing the challenge of War a leader like Churchill is a necessity and Britain certainly had a leader who was fearless and could make the tough decisions needed at the time. I enjoyed reading about Rudolf Hess s trip to Scotland and about the negotiations between Churchill and Roosevelt.  Churchill s daughter Mary brings a fresh and young vide to the book as we see her excitement and fun loving escapades through snippets from her teenage to adult diaries to where she commands an anti-aircraft battery as a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service.  I enjoyed reading about Churchill s eccentric nature and what made him tick and his love for his cat. I adored his quirky nature and his ability to not give a toss what people thought of him. And of course Clementine who was not only a wife and mother but Churchill s close advisor and confident , vetting his speeches, smoothing over his faux pas whenever he made them.  A terrific look back in history and a book I throughly enjoyed and I think readers interested in World War II and the battle of Britain might well enjoy this one.  3 book reviews: A terrific account of the  wouldarkest hour' from the perspective of the Churchills. Mr Larson has a special talent which allows him to engage a reader and leave them satisfied, like myself. This non-fiction is about the times when Great Britain was on the verge of falling into the Nazi hands and regime, and yet, Churchill and his charisma at that very moment prevented the catastrophy. The is not much politics although one might expect a huge portion of it opening a book in which Winston Churchill is the dominating figure. The book is about the spirit that kept the British carrying on during the omnipresent threat of invasion. Personally I found the family accounts and the ways Mr Churchill sought to involve the USA in the war fascinating. The PM was aware of the importance of aid that could be delivered over the Atlantic. 'The Splendid and the Vile' does not focus on the British Isles alone but presents the Nazi perseverance in attempting to conquer them as well. A truly highly recommended book of defiance that led to the liberation of Europe in the later years of WW2.  4 book reviews: Few authors are as gifted writing -  non-fiction  - that reads like -  fiction , - as Erik Larson does. With tenacity and sensitivity, Larson gives us an compelling account of history by humanizing the facts with the interesting array of characters.  Larson masterfully reimagines the  The Blitz and the Battle of Britain , ( bombs dropping & German invasion), in uniquely human terms..... filled with personal and political drama....(tragedies of war, love, family, friends, colleagues, infidelity, divorce, and relationship frictions, were harrowing). The result of Larson s non-fiction-storytelling crafting....(following Winston Churchill s first year as Prime Minister), is a spectacular page turning book.  5 very strong stars! I had heard it was excellent - I was simply waiting for my  library turn .   Human beings are so stupid ....( from Churchill s journal). His observations were not wrong. And.....?..... Is this history tale relevant to today s current events? You betcha!!!  Erik Larson can t  do  uninteresting books!  Blessings to all!  5 book reviews:  Never was there such a contrast of natural splendor and human vileness.  (John Colville s diary entry about the peculiar beauty of watching bombs fall over the city)  What better time than during a pandemic to read about the unrelenting courage of a people during one of the darkest periods of history? During the Blitz, Londoners endured fifty-seven consecutive nights of bombing. Tens of thousands of people died. How did the people endure such a terrifying ordeal? What was it like living day after day knowing that during the night the bombs would rain down and you might be one of the many who would die?  How did they endure? Churchill s determination, unrelenting optimism, and eloquent speeches encouraged the people and gave them hope. He emboldened them to realize the part they played in this moment in history. Amid the sheer terror of the relentless bombings, Churchill was an extraordinary leader and a beacon of hope.  Churchill was a brilliant orator who never wavered in telling the people the hard truth, but always followed it with optimism and an unwavering conviction that England would prevail. His courage was inspiring and his is a picture of true leadership. But he was also a man who had his flaws, quirks, and idiosyncrasies. There was opposition to appointing him as Prime Minister, but at this particular moment in history he was the right man for the job and he got it right.  Covering Winston Churchill s first year in office, between May 1940 and May 1941, Larson, known for his exhaustive research, used personal journals, archival documents, and intelligence reports. Through these we learn of the everyday lives of ordinary citizens, as well as those of Churchill, his family, and the people closest to him. No family is perfect, including Churchill s. The stories of his wife Clementine, his daughter Mary (who ended up being one of my favorite characters!) , his son Randall, and daughter-in-law Pamela, provided much of the human interest stories, making this such a readable book. Though the subject is grim, there s no shortage of humorous stories.  Plenty of books have been written about WWII and The Blitz, but only Erik Larson can tell it in an original way that makes history come alive. I felt as if I lived this story with these characters. It reads like a thrilling novel, but every word, every conversation, is true, and I wasn t ready for the book to end. Larson writes history for people who think they don t like history.  This is a true gem, don t miss it!  * I received a digital copy of the book via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.  6 book reviews: This was fascinating, thrilling, and filled with those \"go team\" moments. Britain and the world VS. Hitler.  I took my time to read this history filled book. It was part memoir of Winston Churchill 's first year as Prime Minister of Britain during WWII. I read lots of WWII fictional novels, BUT this author brought the battle front and center, behind the scenes and was almost impossible to put down.  I loved learning about Churchill and his circle. He was quite a fascinating, and courageous leader. We learn about his private conversations, the secret operations with \"code names\" that were planned to stop Hitler. Spies and prisoner conversations, the yellow boxes that held communications for Churchill only.  The British people were also courageous and very confident in their leader. Loved how they kept their spirits high and just lived their best lives every day even through the heartbreak and struggles. What a moment in our time to read how they handled this!  A few other highlights... The targeting and scares at Windsor Palace, how it was to live through screaming air raids and bomber moons, a baby born during a raid, personal letters and thoughts on the war, quoted diary entries and MUCH MORE.  If you enjoy WWII history/ historical memoirs, I would highly recommend this one.  So much research went into this, I am in awe.  I bought this after reading my GR friends reviews so Thank you Friends!!  7 book reviews: Finally! I absolutely love Erik Larson s other works, but I could not seem to get interested in this one. And, I couldn t figure out why until almost the very end. There were too many story lines, centered around too many people that I found uninteresting, for me to stay with it for more than a few pages at a time. And, having read  In The Garden of Beasts  - which I loved - it seemed like this story was a result of all of the research and notes compiled and left over from that book. Anyway, I ll read anything Larson writes, but this one fell way, way short.  8 book reviews: I have read several books by Eric Larson but   Devil In The White City  was always my favorite, but after reading  The Splendid And The Vile , this one is a tie for me with the above book.  I have never read another author who can make learning about history engaging and easily readable. It was a bit hard to read in part because of the pandemic we are still struggling with. However, it was such a story of human strength, determination and victory that I found it uplifting.  I had never researched Winston Churchill in the past and knew him only by brief articles about him or short films. In reading an article by the author I found that after he visited New York he suddenly understood how New Yorkers felt about 9/11, it was an attack on their home city that none of us living elsewhere could truly understand. He then began to think of London and  the aerial assault of 1940-41 in which they endured 57 consecutive nights of bombing, followed by an intensifying series of nighttime raids over the next six months.   It was then that he decided to write this book and focus on Churchill s 1st year as prime minister and what it must have felt like to have his city invaded from the sea and sky.  This was the year that Churchill became Churchill, the cigar smoking bulldog we all think we know, when he made his greatest speeches and showed the world what courage and leadership looked like . Wow what an incredible achievement of research and smooth flowing prose this book is. I learned about what Churchill s family life was like and how much they struggled. There are also many characters, ordinary citizens, and what it was like for them, to know that when nighttime came the bombing would start again.  Reading this book transported me to England and showed me what a unifying leader Mr. Churchill was, how much the populace loved him and how he walked among the ruins and wept openly. He showed by his actions that he was right there in the battle with his countrymen and kept them inspired and motivated to continue the fight.  This book is as easy to read as fiction but is so educational I think it should be a strongly suggested read for high school students. To look at the war from the UK s point of view and learn what can be achieved by fighting on in spite of the terrible odds they faced.  There has been so much written about this book but truly this is one of the top 10 books I have read this year, simply amazing!  I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.  9 book reviews: Publication day has finally arrived. Enjoy!  Be sure to set aside plenty of time to work your way through this deep exploration of one year in the life of Churchill and those close to him. It will require some patience, but if you are not inclined to read the multi-volume biographies about him, this book is an effective distillation of the man as he navigated his first year as prime minister.  May 10, 1940 through May 10, 1941 was a pivotal year, with the fate of England entirely uncertain and world domination by Hitler a frightening possibility. We know now that everything eventually came out right, but at the time that outcome was by no means a given. German invasion by sea appeared likely. Would England be under Nazi occupation like the rest of Europe? Throughout this year, the English people were repeatedly traumatized by devastating bombing raids. The death toll and destruction was stunning.  What was this year like for Winston Churchill and those close to him? Larson uses diaries, letters, and other historical documents to reconstruct this time for him, his family, aides, and other government figures.  While Winston determined the fate of his country, his eighteen-year-old daughter Mary was doing all the frivolous things wealthy young girls do, war or no war. Falling in love with the wrong boy, going to dances and parties, and visiting her friends in the countryside. His son Randolph was doing what he always did, racking up gambling debts and getting drunk. John Colville, Churchill 's private secretary, was suffering over unrequited love. And of course, Lord Beaverbrook tried to resign about a dozen times, when all he really wanted was for Winston to beg him to stay on.  As with any Churchill portrait, his amusing idiosyncrasies and peccadilloes are on full display here. He had to have two baths per day, and the water had to be 98 degrees. He had no body shame and shocked and embarrassed people with his full or partial nudity. Late at night, he put military marches on the gramophone and paraded up and down in his pale-blue onesie, toting his old rifle. He was a difficult man, irascible, demanding, and moody. But he was also tenderhearted, forgiving, and easily moved to tears.  I came away from this book with a feeling of relief that Churchill was the one at the helm when he was needed most. This was the year that mattered, and he had just the right combination of skills and personality traits to stay the course, juggle strategies, and maintain high morale among the citizens. Hitler and Goring and Goebbels were repeatedly confounded by his unwillingness to surrender or sue for peace. They thought if they just dropped enough bombs, he would have to give in eventually. They severely underestimated his resolve, his resourcefulness, and his patriotism. KBO was his motto, and KBO he did.  10 book reviews: In the Sources and Acknowledgements section of this book, the author states  ...I set out to hunt for the stories that often get left out of the massive biographies of Churchill, either because there s no time to tell them or because they seem too frivolous. But it is in frivolity Churchill often revealed himself, the little moments that endeared him to his staff, despite the extreme demands he placed on all.   This is the kind of history that I like to read, social and political but not primarily military. The book covers the first year that Churchill was prime minister, from May 10, 1940 to May 10, 1941. During that time, the Luftwaffe was attempting to destroy the RAF and then it moved on to the bombing of London to destroy morale and keep England out of the war. Churchill was also trying to convince the United States to provide aid (and ultimately enter the war). This was an uphill battle due to the strong isolationist leanings of many in America. I loved the details about life at No. 10 Downing Street and in England at large.  Citizens brought gas masks to church and began wearing small metal identity disks on bracelets, in case they got blown into unidentifiable pieces. Civil defense pamphlets arrived in mailboxes, describing what to do if a Panzer tank appeared in the neighborhood.  The book gives insight into Churchill s decisions and his family life.  The Prime Minister also kept snippets of poems and biblical passages in a special  keep handy  file.  These snippets found their way into Churchill s speeches.  A lot of information came from the diary of John  Jock  Colville, Churchill s 25 year old private secretary. On one weekend visit to a country estate Colville saw a downed German bomber and then got his wish to witness (from the terrace of the house) an actual air battle among 20 German and British aircraft. Colville and a companion saw planes shot down, pilots parachuting to the ground and bombs setting targets ablaze. Then they played tennis.  I ve read a little about Churchill, but not nearly enough. There are many (really long) biographies of Churchill, but this book gives a very interesting picture of him during this limited period. When Churchill toured a bomb site, he was described as:  Tough, yes, but at times weeping openly, overcome by the devastation and the resilience of the crowd. In one hand he held a large white handkerchief, with which he mopped his eyes; and his other he grasped the handle of his walking stick.  It was said that he had the ability to transform  the despondent misery of disaster into a grimly certain steppingstone to ultimate victory . This book is entertaining, it s informative but not dry. It made me want to learn more, which is the best thing I can say about a history book.  I received a free copy of this book from the publisher.  11 book reviews:  The one universal balm for the trauma of war was tea. It was the thing that helped people cope. People made tea during air raids and after air raids, and on breaks between retrieving bodies from shattered buildings. Tea bolstered the network of thirty thousand observers who watched for German aircraft over England, operating from one thousand observation posts, all stocked with tea and kettles. Mobile canteens dispensed gallons of it, steaming, from spigots. In propaganda films, the making of tea became a visual metaphor for carrying on.  Tea acquired almost a magical importance in London life,  according to one study of London during the war.  And the reassuring cup of tea actually did seem to help cheer people up in a crisis.  Tea ran through Mass-Observation diaries like a river.  That s one trouble about the raids,  a female diarist complained.  People do nothing but make tea and expect you to drink it.  Tea anchored the day though at teatime, Churchill himself did not actually drink it, despite reputedly having said that tea was more important than ammunition. He preferred whiskey and water. Tea was comfort and history; above all, it was English. As long as there was tea, there was England.\"   A PERFECT BLEND OF  - the Historical and the Personal - the Factual and the Emotional - the Heroic and the Mundane - Sobriety and Humour.  Author and narrator took me on a journey where I knew the major landmarks (historic events during the Battle of Britain waged in the air) and the destination (final defeat of Hitler 's Germany in 1945), nevertheless it was a hair-raising, goosebumpy, breathtaking wildride where I was time and again reduced to tears and thrust into despair, felt thrilled and elated beyond words.  Larson put together a colourful and sharp caleidoscope of facts, private diaries, newspaper reports and radio broadcasts to show us the Blitzkrieg from the POV of Churchill and Britain (Chruchill 's daughter Mary and private secretary John Coleville, plus several British \"mass observation diarists\" -I did not even know that was a thing!!), major players in Germany (Hitler, Hess, Goebbels, G ring, Adolf Galland) &the United Sates (Roosevelt, Averell Harryman, Harry Hopkins).  It was like listening to a live docu drama - full of tension and excitement. I cannot praise or recommend it high enough.  12 book reviews: The book follows one year in the life of Winston Churchill, the first year at his post as prime minister and the initial phase of the Second World War. It takes us through both the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. Starting in May 1940, it moves forward pretty much day by day. Nothing here is conjectured; all that is presented is based on solid fact and diary entries. What isn t known is not said. It attempts to recreate the day by day happenings of not only Churchill but also those close to him. This reads almost as mini-memoirs of Winston and Clementine, their eldest son Randolph and his wife Pamela, the Churchill s youngest, living daughter Mary and Nelson, their cat. Through the numerous quotes one gets a good feel for what each of the family members lived through this one year, May 1940 through May 1941. You also get a good feel for each one s personality.  Outside of the family, one follows closely John Colville (Churchill s private secretary),  Prof  Frederick Lindemann (friend and scientific adviser to Churchill), General Pug Ismay (close friend and confidant), Lord Max Beaverbrook (Head of Aircraft Production Ministry). Each one s idiosyncrasies and personality traits are revealed. Details concerning Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels and Harry Hopkins are provided too. The book brings you close to these figures, shows you the personal side of who they are. There is of course history presented, but I do not see this as the main focus.  Here is what the book does well. Here is what I like.  *It puts you there in London during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. Heavy bombardment, buildings burning, falling down around you. Gas masks are donned. There is a cordite smell in the air. Some are taken over by their fear; others totally disregard imminent danger. There is at the same time exuberant partying; the belief being that one must get the most out of life while one can. The fear of being alone, dying alone, has people clinging to each other. Sex outside of marriage has no longer the stigma it had before. being hurt in a raid could fill one with exhilaration and happiness. Just to be alive was glorious.  *On closing this book, you feel you have come to know Churchill intimately. You have felt his indefatigable energy and vigor, his courage, his emotionality. One minute he is guffawing, laughing, with a cigar in his mouth and a glass of whiskey in his hand, maybe he is even dancing naked. Why not? As he says to Roosevelt, he has not a thing to hide. Then later, tears roll from his eyes. Or he may turn around and spout out the most magnificent turn of phrase. His oratory is magnificent.  * Clementine is shown from another perspective than in other books I have read. A more favorable view is drawn. What she does, why she pulls herself away and disappears for long periods makes perfect sense to me now. She is not cold and unfeeling; she is regaining balance to be able to go on. She is not afraid to say what she thinks. Winston listens to her and respects what she says. He saw that the air raid shelters were improved as she had advised.  * Now, when I think of Lord Beaverbrook, who quits over and over again to get his own way, I smile. The same thing happens with the  Prof , Frederick Lindemann, and John Colville. These were Churchill s friends and they have become mine too, simply because I know them now as human beings.  *The book ends with a good epilog. It concisely summarizes the fates of the central figures spoken of.  What s on the negative side? The book needs much tighter editing. There are details that should have been cut. There is too much unnecessary information. One example will I hope suffice. We need not be told the size, shape and color nuance of the pills Rudolf Hesse (Deputy F hrer to Hitler) packed on his solo flight to Scotland in 1941. On his own initiative, he sought to negotiate peace with Churchill. This certainly did not please Hitler in the least! The information about the flight and Hitler s reaction to it belong here but not the color and shape of his pills!  When the book was over, I was relieved. The book seems very long for what it contains. If you have read a lot about the Second World War, you will not find much new.  Matt Addis performs the audiobook. All that he says is clear, and the pacing is perfect. He reads slowly; you have time to think and absorb what you are being told. This is very important with non-fiction. He wonderfully matches his intonations to the person speaking. He intones women and men equally well. English, American and German words are correctly pronounced. I adored his intonation for Winston. It s marvelous. You feel as though you are listening to Winston Churchill himself! I do not hesitate to give the narration performance five stars.  *******************  * 5 stars * 4 stars * 3 stars * 3 stars * TBR  13 book reviews: No other British city experienced such losses, but throughout the United Kingdom the total civilian deaths in 1940 and 1941, including those in London, reached 44,652 with another 52,370 injured.  Of the dead, 5,626 were children.   Mel    14 book reviews: Initially I wasn t going to read this as I felt I d read enough on this period in British history. I changed my mind after seeing the number of favourable reviews the book has received. To borrow a word from the title, this book is splendidly readable. My edition has about 500 pages, not including the notes, bibliography and index, but I whizzed through it.  I ve said in other reviews that Britain was incredibly lucky to have had Churchill as leader in 1940. The margin between survival and defeat was a very thin one and this was a genuine case of where leadership made the difference. The book focuses on Churchill and his inner circle during the period of May 1940   May 1941, and how they coped during a period of constant military reverses and nightly bombing of the country s cities by the Luftwaffe. Substantial parts of the book are quite gossipy, focusing on the personal lives of Churchill s children and entourage. This is deliberate on the part of the author - he says at the outset that he wanted the book to be a different slant on the study of Churchill in 1940, a subject that has otherwise been exhaustively covered. I was surprised though that he made no mention of the  War Cabinet Crisis  of 27/28 May 1940, when Lord Halifax suggested Britain should seek terms from Nazi Germany. That must have been a stressful time for Churchill.  The book s other main theme is a study of London during the Blitz. There are some remarkable descriptions of the period, such as the number of accidents that occurred because of the blackout. There were also marked changes in sexual behaviour. Faced with the possibility of an early death, married people had affairs and young people threw caution away. An actress, Theodora Rosling, wrote of the Blitz:    I was astonished to read that the annual debutantes  ball, at which aristocratic young women were  presented  to society, took place at the Grosvenor House Hotel in March 1941, during the middle of a massive air raid. That s one of the most stereotypically British things I ve ever read. Another was a description of Churchill, Colville and others falling about laughing whilst watching a German newsreel of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass, with the two dictators strutting about and giving each other fascist salutes,  funnier than anything Charlie Chaplin produced in The Great Dictator , according to Colville. In its descriptions of the Blitz though, the book s focus on Churchill s inner circle means that we hear more of the voices of the elite than of ordinary Londoners.  If there was ever a case of  cometh the hour, cometh the man  it was Churchill in 1940. This is an entertaining and novel addition to the voluminous body of work about the man and his time.  15 book reviews: Erik Larson has done it again! The Splendid and The Vile is the one nonfiction book you need to move to the top of your TO BE READ list now. If you are a lover of history but not the  put-you-to-sleep  book of facts and figures, this book is definitely for you.  Mr. Larson selects the first year of Winston Churchill s service as Prime Minister of Britain, 5 May 1940   5 May 1941 to focus our attention on not only the life of Winston Churchill, but also his family and others that come into his sphere of influence during this period. We are privileged to get  snapshots  of conversations, thoughts, deeds, lives of those directly affected by the War from the diaries of those who lived it. This all woven within an expertly well-researched and fascinating book.  The vile acts of a fascist Germany waging a second war against countries that refuse to accept its ideology are juxtaposed against a free Britain that is barely hanging on against the psyche-shattering nightly bombings. Germany sets out to bring Britain to its knees with an eye-watering number of planes and bombs. Hitler expects that Britain can be bombed into submission. The results of this campaign of terror and how it affects daily life is stunning.  But life must go on for the British. Churchill must rally the people, the government and allies to accomplish his goal and introduce Germany to the consequences of its path of destruction.  It is splendid unity and resilience of a common cause.  My thanks to Crown/Random House for this advance copy in exchange for an unbiased review.  16 book reviews: I have read a fair amount about Churchill, the bombings of Great Britain, and the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt (not to mention having viewed many movies and documentaries). While there is necessarily some factual overlap, I found this book, told mainly through the lens of the Churchill family, to be a fresh and intimate account of those dark days. John Lee did a great job narrating the audio version. His voice really brought Churchill alive. I knew of Churchill 's intelligence but not his quirkiness. These details were amusing and also made him seem so charming.  Churchill 's leadership and his ability to inspire through his oratory talent has long been recognized. While our current pandemic pales when compared to the fifty-seven nights of bombing endured by the people of Great Britain, there are parallels and comparisons that can be drawn. Churchill was able to instill courage and hope in the people he served. He united the people, not with false hope but with fortitude. The Nazi 's were vile, the attacks were vile, but Churchill 's words were not vile. His words were carefully chosen, chosen to guide his people and help them persevere. It was refreshing to be reminded of what great leadership is and how powerful and important the words of a true leader are to the populace.  I confess to a bias; Larson is a favorite author of mine. He never disappoints. His books are always informative and extremely compelling. Any reader who believes non-fiction is dull and needs to be avoided should give this book a try. This book, and all of the books I have read by Larson, bring history to life. I will never again view a full moon and not think, \"What a beautiful night for an air raid.\"  17 book reviews: What can I possibly say that has not already been said by the hundreds of reviewers of this book! Superb comes to mind....masterful....enthralling....future classic.....WOW!!! Erik Larson has taken his place in literary history with his series of books which seem to just be getting better as time goes by. His research appears to be infallible and often does not depend on the usual sources.  if your are a particular lover of all things Churchill, it sometimes is hard to find a book that offers new information but Larson succeeds. We follow Churchill from his first day as PM through the end of the first year (with a short final chapter on the lives of the main players in later years). It was the job of Churchill and his government to recover from the appeasement attitude of the previous PM and prove the England (and London) \"can take it\". The events of the first days were enough to knock most countries off their pins as the BEF retreated to the beaches of Dunkirk and it appeared that they would be lost. This great defeat was turned into a moral victory as Churchill sent ships and private craft across the Channel to rescue the British and French soldiers. And thus began the second career of the finest and most controversial PM in British history. Highly, highly recommended.  18 book reviews: \"I have nothing to offer but blood, tears, toil and sweat.\" - Churchill Address to the House of Commons, 13 May 1940  \"We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and in the air. We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall never surrender.\" - Churchill Address to the House of Commons, 4 June 1940  \"Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years men will still say this was their finest hour.\" - Churchill Address to the House of Commons, 16 June 1940  \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\" - Churchill Address to the House of Commons, 20 August 1940  ************  Author Erik Larson did undergraduate studies in Russian history at U. Penn before a journalism masters at Columbia. It 's surprising after a twenty year career of writing non-fiction he has not covered any Russian periods. It would be interesting to read as his books are well written. This one is no exception, about Churchill 's first year as PM, as France fell and Britain was bombed. I am not a WWII expert by any measure. Having read only a few general histories the events were mostly fresh for me.  One thing Larson does well is to put the reader inside scenes he describes without fake dialogue or internal thoughts. The words of the actors are taken from diaries and letters, the stage sets from real life and the rest filled in with historical background material. It helps that many people published memoirs of the time. The ability to see and hear aspects of the history available on internet photography and recordings is also an advantage. It adds almost as much information as is contained in the book.  Something that stands out, and probably not a surprise for anyone else, is how heroic Churchill actually was. In the first days of his office, faced with existential threat, he was able to inspire confidence and action in others. At the age of sixty five, when many might wish for a quiet retirement, he led Britain from destruction by an aspiring empire. His oratory skills, energy and creative thinking were off the scale, but in other ways he was stubborn and impulsive. His own ideas on empire were another issue.  Larson covers from May 1940, when Churchill is reluctantly requested by King George VI to form a government, to May 1941 when the Blitz ends. Hitler 's air force is repelled and without air superiority he calls off the land invasion. Along the way we follow Churchill, his cabinet and family, from 10 Downing Street to his weekend residence Chequers. The book covers the major air battles, propaganda wars, an aircraft production campaign and efforts to influence FDR, ending in the attack on Pearl Harbor.  As in many popular histories there is a fair amount of fluff included. There could have been less frequent excursions into the love life of Churchill 's family and staff. Newspaper articles, polls and social surveys are employed, an approach developed by academic historians, used with advantageous results. Goering and Goebbels appear in vignettes, as does Rudolf Hess and his mysterious flight to Scotland. Larson 's accounts of the pulverizing 'Satan' bombs on buildings and people in England are riveting.  Larson succeeds in representing one facet of the conflict. Like his 'Garden of Beasts', about an American ambassador 's family in Hitler 's Berlin, he adds a dash of dishy character development. Most people included had important roles to play, from ministers and special appointees to friends and family. The tension and terror of the screaming Stuka dive bombers and Spitfire defense are well described. Future air battles on this scale with modern military technology would cause unthinkable devastation.  19 book reviews: 5 outstanding stars  As always is the case, books by Erik Larson transcend the usual historical novel. This author always goes above and beyond in his books and provides the readers with a story that not only flows smoothly, but also is able to provide facts that are fascinating, erudite, and ultimately educate the reader, in a way that is fascinating and captivating.  There are multiple books about Winston Churchill, but this one merged together flawlessly pieces of his life. Winston had the uncanny ability to unite a nation that was bombarded with everything Nazi Germany had in its arsenal, but still managed to carry through to victory. It was also a fine tribute to the men and women behind the scenes, those who carried on because of Winston, and those family members who so believed in their husband and father. Winston did not believe in failure and though there were many, his indomitable spirit seemed to transcend defeat and inspire in the British people that spirit, and drive that nothing could or would crush them.  Winston 's character, that tough cigar chomping man who had various idiosyncrasies, was a marvel among men. His spirit and determination led a beleaguered country to its ultimate goal, that of staying a free Britain. He was a masterful leader of people, who made those around him strive for things it seemed impossible to achieve. The populace adored him, as he made himself one of them, walking through the ruins of war so gallantly and heroically, delivering speeches to the people, standing tall in the face of an imminent defeat. He was the man England needed and he pushed through valiantly, providing his nation with the spirit and determination it so needed in its hour of darkness.  Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the hard may be; for without victory there is no survival.   If you are at all interested in history, in a man, in a country that stood up to what others might have claimed as unbeatable odds this book is one for you. I recommend it most highly for its authentic look at a man and a time that should always be viewed as the epitome of the human spirit.  Thank you to Erik Larson, Crown Publishing, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this fabulous book due out February 25, 2020.  20 book reviews: Leadership! Apparently King George VI felt that Churchill had something that the country needed when he appointed him to replace Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in the spring of 1940. Observers, at the time, felt Churchill was  flamboyant, electric, wholly unpredictable  and a questionable choice to be Prime Minister. Larson s excellent non-fiction account confirms that Churchill was all of that and more. But most of all he was a leader who knew how to move a nation with the force of his personality and stirring speeches. [I learned that Churchill often practiced certain phrases and references with family and friends before incorporating them into his speeches.]  Larson provides a vivid account of Churchill s first year as Prime Minister when the Germans pounded the British with bombing night after night. Churchill knew that the British could not hold out forever; and Larson s account includes how Churchill wooed the United States to come to his country s aid first through the Lend-Lease Act and then entry into the war itself after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Highly recommend this wonderful addition to Churchill biographies.  21 book reviews: As an aside, I was a little depressed by how resilient the British people were during this awful time for their country. They willingly blacked out their windows for safety in the evening, suffered through sleepless nights in air raid shelters during bombings, and then woke up and then went to work the next morning or helped cleanup/retrieve the dead on a volunteer basis. Meanwhile the Americans were selfish jerks who refused to help Britain in any meaningful way until the bombing of Pearl Harbor. And even now we have idiots who wo not even wear a mask in the middle of a pandemic because it supposedly infringes on their \"freedom\". We are the worst! But I digress.  This book took me almost four months to finish reading, but that 's not a reflection on the book itself. It just turn out that a book about WWII was not something to lighten my mood during this months long quarantine. Who would have thought? Haha!  On it 's own merits, this actually is a really good book. It brought to life not only Churchill and his immediate family/retinue, but also the conditions of how the British civilians lived during this time, and insight into some of the key German leaders that planned the attacks on England. The extensive use of diaries as sources/quotes for this book really enhanced what otherwise might have been a dry rendering of events (much like we all learned in school).  I hands down recommend this book over the only other book I have read by this author, .  22 book reviews: I have always admired the British for standing up to Hitler s forces in WWII, after almost all of Europe had fallen under Nazi control. How did they endure the almost nightly bombing raids? This book focuses on Churchill s first year (1940-1941) as British Prime Minister, the Battle of Britain, and what life was like for Churchill, his family, and his inner circle. As Larson states in his introductory notes to readers:    Larson draws upon memoirs, diaries, letters, recently declassified material, and many other sources documented in the appendix. He artfully weaves personal stories into the larger tapestry of significant events, Churchill s famous speeches, and the escalating war with Nazi Germany. He shows Churchill s active pursuit of involvement by the United States, along with the obstacles. The reader gains insight into Churchill as a person, including his leadership style, daily routines, and eccentricities.  Mary Churchill s diary and previously unpublished excerpts from John Colville s journal provide material for many personal anecdotes. I found it interesting that Mary, Churchill s seventeen-year-old daughter, acts as most would expect of an adventurous teen, even while her parents try to protect her by sending her away from London. Larson also mines German sources, such as Goebbels  journal and fighter pilot Adolf Galland s recollections.  A few highlights include: - The need to camouflage Chequers, the country house supplied to the Prime Minister, where he entertained family, colleagues, and dignitaries - Professor Frederick Lindemann s scientific ideas to assist in the war effort - Rudolf Hess  flight to Scotland  is a masterful work of narrative non-fiction and is up to the high standards I have come to expect from Erik Larson. I have previously read five of the author s works and this one is of the same superior quality. Larson puts the  story  in history. Highly recommended!   23 book reviews: I have read many accounts about WWII and the Blitz, but what Eric Larson did so supremely well with this book, much of which was new to me, was to provides the fascinating inside story of the personal lives of Churchill, his family and the people who worked close with him, including 2 American aides. These details could be funny , poignant or just informative; they read like gossip from People magazine - engagements, marriages, childbirth, love affairs, breakups, unrequited love, broken hearts, temper tantrums (Churchill 's), and parties. Lots of parties. Thank goodness people kept personal diaries in those days. These personal details mixed in with the accounts of the bombing of London, Churchill hoping anxiously for more and more aid from America, and England 's reprisal attacks on Germany made the book so compelling even though I already knew the ending.  I have read about the courage and optimism of the British people during this time but Larson shows us how responsible Churchill was for these. HIs radio speeches were always truthful but full of optimism. He was beloved by the people. He would often make it a point to visit a site which had just been bombed the night before and would get rounds of applause and cheers from people who had just lost their homes and perhaps loved ones.  I am so thankful that the English people had Churchill as their leader during this war because he was such a beacon of optimism and held the country and it 's people together under such trying times. Churchill was only human and did not have the proverbial English stiff upper life. He held the weight of this war on his shoulders and during hard times his spirits would flag and he would need bolstering in order to regain his optimism. This could happen through receiving good news, a talk with a close friend and associate, a bath (he took 2 a day) or having his most trusted advisors and friends over for dinner and staying up until 2 at night singing and dancing much to the dismay of many who preferred to be in bed but stayed up out of politeness.  Despite the report of death tolls and the details of the bombing raids this novel is so full of optimism, fun and of a country unified that I often had a feeling of wanting to have been there! I suppose that may have something to do with our country 's (and the world 's) current crisis and how our country is currently being led.  24 book reviews: Larsen has written an intimate portrait of Churchill s first year as Prime Minister of Britain, undertaking his duties as Hitler and Germany resolve to break the island nation to their will. He writes of Churchill himself, his peculiarities, his resilience, his dogged determination to obtain assistance from Roosevelt and the United States. Additionally, he adds details from the viewpoints and the lives of Winston s daughter, Mary, a somewhat starry-eyed eighteen year old, son Randolph, a married but philandering gambler, daughter-in-law Pamela, loving wife Clementine, and private secretary John Colville, among others. All of these people left trails of information behind, whether in diaries, letters, etc., that Larsen used in pursuit of his own approach to Churchill s life.  Through this method, combining the very personal daily details with overall war strategy, we readers are allowed a close up view of the intensifying air war over Britain, the Blitz, the Battle of Britain. To counter that, we are also provided with some inkling of what is happening among German leadership.  I strongly recommend this book to all who enjoy history or just enjoy a true story of a dangerous time very well told. We know how it ended, but not how close the story came to a different ending. Here you will see a portrait of leadership at its strongest, a nation holding together in spite of horrific loss. Churchill is the linchpin who held everything and everyone together.  A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review.  25 book reviews: Articulate, charismatic, courageous, honorable, inspiring, admirable, well informed, and someone to trust for guidance - these are a few of the characteristics Winston Churchill imparted to the British while the German Luftwaffe incessantly bombed their Britain.  As usual. Erik Larsen has written his account scouring a barage of documentation that includes personal diaries, military statistics, autobiographies and more. He gives the reader a flavor not only for the air battle but also for the inner workings of Churchill, his confidants, his family, their unique personalities, and the strength and fortitude of the British population. The cast of characters is immense.  A fictional war story could not be as engaging and Churchill s personality and work habits are what make this an amazing historical telling.  26 book reviews: Wow! What a fantastic book. I had read some of the history of the Blitz, but nothing with this type of depth. It depicts a city and country under horrible siege. It further depicts a country and its people 's resilience to the horror.  Larson 's work focuses on Churchill, yet gives the reader feeling for the impact of the years of the Blitz on his close associates, immediate family, and the country as a whole. He also delves into the mindset of the German leaders and their anticipated outcome of bombing the British people into submission.  I learned much about the man and leader Churchill was, from his quirks (Siren suits and martial music), insecurities, and his well-known fortitude.  A must-read for lovers of WWII history, English history, or those looking for a great non-fiction read.  27 book reviews: A common reaction to this title is  why in heaven do we need another book about Churchill and the Battle of Britain?  For me, knowing Larson s talent for homing in on obscure human stories amid historical events, I could only rush to dive in and see what he picked up on and how it could achieve fresh revelations. Despite my fairly recent reads of the Manchester/Reid biographical trilogy on Churchill and Korda s history of the Battle of Britain,  On Wings of Eagles , I was well satisfied with this tour of the daily life of Churchill s inner circle and family during his first year as Prime Minister starting in May 1940. We get a portrait of adaptation and resilience of individuals putting up a last stand of defiance in the face of Hitler s takeover of most of Europe. And somehow, despite the horrors of the long bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe, pursuing the simple pleasures of life and love in the intervals they could steal.  Churchill s leadership and the adoption by the populace of widespread volunteerism and the attitudes of  soldiering on  go hand in hand, each inspiring the other. Just what we would wish we could have for the COVID pandemic. It is fitting that NY Governor Cuomo has effectively shared Churchill quotations for inspiration, including:   with respect to first responders and health care staff being saviors like the RAF and air defense staff   with respect to first signs of a plateau in new cases being like a hopeful phase in a war destined to last much longer  Larson forges his own path for explicating Churchill s personality in relationship to his leadership qualities. Behind the clever tactician and ambitious wheeler-dealer, we experience his rollercoasters of mood from humor and delight to blackdog despairs and sense of affront when thwarted. Larson leavens his story with choice examples of Churchill s episodes of casual nudity, of his child-like breaking out into song or dance, and of sudden tears in response to basic kindness of ordinary people: .  A key factor in his success was his inspiration of loyalty and trust in a special set of people in his inner circle. His minister of war production, Max Beaverbook, and scientific advisor and Oxford physicist Frederick Lindemann, get the most air time in the narrative. Churchill sanctioned Beaverbrook to wield incredible power to appropriate facilities and supplies for aircraft manufacturing, often at the expense of other wartime industries, making it possible for the RAF to keep up in the war of attrition with the Luftwaffe. Despite continually submitting resignations in order to leverage getting his way, Churchill always forgave him while giving in.  Like Beaverbrook, Lindemann (the  Prof ) was disliked by many for a comparable arrogance and irascibility, yet was welcomed as a virtual member of the Churchill household for countless evenings and weekends. Though his main job was running a department of statistics charged with assessing British and German military capacity, he was given  license to explore any scientific , technical, or economic matter that might influence the progress of the war . Many of the schemes he cooked up captured the childlike imagination of Churchill, who then pressed for investing resources on them. Dropping bombs by parachute in front of German bombers was one such scheme that proved ineffective. By contrast, the Prof s support of a former student s inferences about the German use of a radar guidance system for night-time bombing, dismissed by the Air Command as impossible, proved to be true, opening paths for countering their system.  The true strength of Larson s narrative are the portraits he paints of his young personal assistant John Colville ( Jock ), Churchill s teenaged daughter Mary, and his daughter-in-law, Mary. New material Larson mines for his narrative include an unpublished memoir by Colville, who was in his early 20s, as well as other personal diaries of ordinary Brits. The details on their everyday activities, aspirations, and romantic lives helps me understand much better how the Brit s could sustain the desperate prospects of their nation and daily threats from bombing in this period. Korda in his account of the Battle of Britain covered how some Brits would keep golfing during an air raid, which was a mystery to me. Now I comprehend better Mandel s dictum that  survival is not enough  in her post-apocalyptic tale,  Station Eleven.  Such understanding is well worth bearing in mind during the current pandemic.  This book was provided by the publisher for review through the Netgalley program.  28 book reviews: Another wonderful, deep dive by Erik Larson into one moment in history: in this case, it is the Nazi blitz on London in 1940 and 1941, as seen mostly (but not entirely) from the perspective of Winston Churchill, his family, and his leadership team. Illuminating, page-turning, and -- even if you know the basics of the story -- fascinating. 29 book reviews: Who was Winston Churchill? He was irascible, mischievous, mercurial, politician extraordinaire, an iconic statesman, brilliant orator, prone to eccentric sartorial choices during his personal time, husband, father, and father-in-law. Most importantly, he was a strong and decisive leader. The Blitz occurred during his first year as Prime Minister and he united the British people as they faced the most serious threat to freedom. Larson s book provides a singular and superior perspective of the man, his challenges, inner circle, family life, and fight against Hitler. Given the polarization present in America this book underscores the need for a unifying President and Commander-in Chief today.  ",
    " The Vanishing Half: A Novel": "book reviews: Unpopular opinion. This book was just ok.  I loved the frenzy surrounding this book, and the gorgeous cover, and all the hype that went along with it, but to me, this book did not live up to its hype. It 's too safe.  This book is a story of twin girls, who come from a very small town called Mallard. The town is so small you ca not even find it on a map. However, this town is quite unique, in that each of the inhabitants of this black town are so light, that a passerby might mistake many of them for white. The twins though are itching to escape and make a life of their own after their mother basically cancels all of their future hopes and dreams by taking them out of school so that they can work and contribute money to the household. So when they flee their little town and head for the big city, they are able to see the world with eyes wide open, looking for a chance to spread their wings and fly and live how they have always wanted to live. Free. However, freedom comes with a price as they soon realize. The book attempts to share what the cost of freedom will be for these 2 twin girls from Mallard. We also learn about the daughters, cousins really, named Jude (Desiree 's daughter) and Kennedy (Stella 's daughter) and how the twins' decisions has affected the lives of their offspring.  From the beginning I feel this book just dragged on endlessly for no reason other than to stir up some drama. I felt like there were some really interesting topics that the author wanted to bring to light, but most of the topics all stopped short of really exploring those ideas. I feel like the author played it safe with this book because she never really uncovered any of the underlying reasons or hidden truths or exposed anyone to really get to the meat of the story.  Topics included in this book: - Colorism and passing for white - Classism - Domestic Violence - Identity issues - Lying/hiding truths - LGBTQIA+ - Self-esteem/self-confidence - Racism/bigotry  I felt like the main purpose of this book was to tell a story about one of the twins vanishing and passing for white, which it somewhat told, but it did not nearly scratch the surface to the pain it caused for Stella, for Desiree, for Adele, for Jude, for Kennedy. We do not get to see Stella really go through the fear and pain of passing for white or what it did to her individual life, we see some of the effects of how it affected her family somewhat, but not entirely. We do not get to see the great chasm it caused between her mother and those lost years. We do not know to what extent of the pain of the separation caused her to be away from her twin. We see glimpses, but it 's never tapped into fully and it leaves you discontent and wanting more.  There are whole sections that talk about the daughters and how they eventually meet and how it affects the dynamics of the entire family, but even that part is somewhat nondescript and leaves you wanting more. The author skims the surface on really important topics and that was very frustrating for me to read.  We learn about Jude and her boyfriend Reece, who is a trans man, but we never really get to see more of that world. The topics of identity and LGBTQIA+ are very gray, fuzzy, and frustrating to say the least. The author is attempting to share how Reece is \"passing\" as a man, but that makes it somewhat weird, as if he 's hiding something when the author has depicted Reece as someone who is sure of what he wants. I do not see Reece as having to hide in the closet of his sexuality, but the author appears to try and connect the \"passing of white\" as the same as \"passing as a man\" and I just did not agree with that combination. The life that Reece and Jude have seem very normal, almost too normal, compared to what many Trans persons actually share and explain how they are abused and disrespected, that this depiction of their perfect life does not realistically share what this community goes through when they make this life choice for themselves. The fallout. All of that was not in here.  There really was no plot twist, nothing to keep you captivated, just very predictable in the beginning and end. The middle had some interesting parts, but it also left out really meaty parts that could have made this book a banger. Essentially, there are no repercussions to passing for white, like there are no repercussions for white people doing what they do everyday in real life, they get to do what they want and get away with it for good, and that made this book somewhat of a long drawn out bore for me.  Cover is gorgeous though. Story, not so much. 3 stars.  1 book reviews: 3.5 stars. I enjoy Bennett as a writer, but I felt like this book did not come all the way together. I wanted it to either be a more focused book with half the plot or to really go big and have more about all the characters.  At first it feels like this book is going to be entirely about colorism and the strange town of Mallard, Louisiana where light-skinned Black people have effectively segregated themselves. The story begins here, with the story of twins Stella and Desiree, who grow up and then escape the town. Desiree returns after leaving her abusive husband with her dark-skinned daughter Jude. And at this point I thought this may be the real focus of the book. But then we seem to jump so quickly through time, which threw me somewhat off kilter. Desiree does not want to stay, but she does. And it is hard to understand why she stays knowing how unwelcome the town is for her daughter, but we gloss over it and start jumping ahead to when Jude finally leaves, moving into the other part of the story, set mostly in Southern California where Jude goes to college and then encounters long-lost Stella, who has cut off communication with her family and now passes for white.  Then we have another section of the story, filling out those years of Stella 's life, and this was much of the best of the book. Stella, always so afraid of being found out, develops a strange and complicated friendship with a Black family that moves in across the street in their wealthy subdivision. We get to see why Stella passes but all the ways in which it has complicated her life and her own identity.  But then we push forward again, leaving just as a plot is really diving into what 's interesting. The sections between cousins-but-also-strangers Kennedy and Jude are not as interesting as I wanted them to be, and did not really dive very far into how different these women 's lives are, race matters somewhat, but it 's not clear what the daughters are here to tell us.  I also have to note that I was frustrated and concerned by Jude 's plot, which mostly centers around her relationship with Reese, a trans man. Almost all of the elements around Reese and queerness felt vague and fuzzy when many other things were given to us in such detail. Reese passes as a cis man so easily that after several years everyone wonders why Reese and Jude are still unmarried. Equating passing as a trans person with racial passing makes me feel very uncomfortable. They are not things that can and should be compared. So I had my hackles up almost immediately when Reese entered the story. And for much of Jude 's first section, we get the typical kind of Trans 101 you expect when the cis character is the focus of the story and the trans character is a kind of window dressing. I was also confused by many of the details around Jude and Reese 's social life, where they are out with groups of gay men and going to drag shows in the 70 's. It is not impossible, but spaces for gay men have not exactly been open and friendly to trans men, and it would be unusual for a trans man with a girlfriend to be in that kind of space. (Yes, queer people have often been terrible and exclusionary and sexist and racist and plenty of other things.) The drag, again, seems to hammer in this idea of taking on a new identity as recurring theme, but again I am not sure that it really works. It is nice that Jude is so accepting but she 's so accepting and they face no real repercussions to their relationship that sometimes it seems to almost invalidate the difficulties a trans man and his partner would have faced at the time.  Without the queer issues, this would have still been a solid 4 stars for me, but I really could not get past it. Trans rep in fiction is certainly up, but there is so often this feeling that they are not quite as fully real as other characters, that their trans-ness is there for some kind of message, and it really bothers me.  I did this book on audio and it probably did not help that I did not like the reader.  2 book reviews: Congrats for its big win as the best historical fiction from Goodreads Choice Awards! At least this time the book I chose is a great winner!    News flash: HBO and Brit Bennett made a 7 figure deal for the adaptation of the book into limited series!   Wowza! This is unique! This is impeccable! This is perfectly written and I wished it never ended, pushed myself to read it slower, rereading some chapters over and over! It s phenomenal and one of the best readings of the year!  Welcome to Mallard/Louisa: small town can be hardly found ( or never found) on your maps: maybe you may accidentally find there during your unluckiest hitchhiking experience. A town has been founded by Alphonse Decuir, inherited acres of land from his father, making this place the home of people who are not accepted in the white community but also who reject to be treated like negroes. And in 1938 two little girls- identical twins: Stella and Desiree Vignes were born. Throughout the years they have been having hard times to find their places in the community, Desiree always told her sister she would find a way to get the hell of there. It s not easy to relate in place where its people think if you have lighter skin, you may have better luck.  And when they are sixteen, their mother pushes them to leave school and work in a wealthy white people s gorgeous mansion as cleaners. Stella starts yearning the rich people s lives as Desiree dreams other possibilities they can have. When she watches Roman Holiday at the theater she dreams to be actress which makes her thing endless possibilities of outer world as soon as she escape from her prisoner life in the town.  And one day: they truly leave the town to go to New Orleans, only two hours away. But as you can imagine: running away from your home in your young ages without enough money and life experiment push the girls  limits. They may take risks or go back to the place where they run. So both of them take different paths which result with different life patterns: Stella marries with a wealthy white man and has a girl who thinks she is white as Desiree chooses to end her relationship with her abusive husband and go back to Mallard 14 years later with her child and because of her child s dark skin she is not welcomed by town s people.  Even though I had some prejudged approach to Stella s life choices, it was impossible not to ache for her as you witness her melancholy, loneliness, trying to living a lie.  Throughout 40 years, we witness twins  lives and see how their daughters  paths cross.  Normally I don t like to read stories told by too many POVS which could be confusing and create unnecessary commotion in my head but this time hearing multiple voices and reading the incredible stories which are connected and completed each other like puzzle pieces were joyful reading experience for me.  This story is truly though-provoking, extremely emotional, soul crushing, realistic, shaking you to the core. This is one of the books stay with you forever. I truly enjoyed each chapter, characters and I highly recommend it to fiction, historical fiction genre lovers.      3 book reviews: What a tour de force Bennett has achieved with The Vanishing Half. Brilliant and complex, this story surpassed all my expectations and more.  Twins Desiree and Stella could not wait to leave behind the small, black town they have grown up in. At sixteen, they finally seize their chance and run away. More than a decade later, the twins have lost touch with each other. One comes back to town with a black daughter, while the other lives across the country, passing for white while hiding her past. As time goes on, they and their respective daughters realize you can never quite cut the ties of the past.  This book touches upon so many worthy topics. The themes of race and racism captured in this book are among the most nuanced and insightful I have come across. At its core, racism is the opportunity for one group to make themselves feel better by acting out to oppress another. There is no group that is immune to being the oppressor, including those that are oppressed themselves. The way the light-skinned colored people of Mallard act towards dark-skinned people both captures the insidiousness of racism (racism only begets more racism) and its pervasiveness in society. I appreciate the book 's honesty on this, no matter how disheartening it is to think about.  Another interesting theme captured over and over is whether someone can ever leave their past and heritage behind to make a clean start. The twins ran away thinking they could be the controller of their own destiny. But as they grow older and their paths diverge, it becomes apparent that their years growing up in Mallard continues to follow them. Even as they meet different opportunities and experiences, their past still contributes to shape their decisions and ultimately where they end up. It 's possible to live separate lives through different decisions, as illustrated by the twins' dual contrasting paths, but they still remain within the parameters of their past.  The twins' daughters are also molded by their mothers, yet they are a new generation, the first to break through the confines of their mothers' past. The daughters could truly say they are making strides when it comes to racism, having been given increased opportunities, which allow them to become more open and accepting than their mothers (as racism begets more racism, opportunities beget less). Another interesting point is that one daughter grew up with privilege and wealth, while the other grew up wanting. Yet, through choices and motivations, the one who grew up with less arguably ended up with more. And that is an encouraging thought.  This story covers so much ground, both in terms of the strands of the twins' and their daughters' narratives, as well as its exploration of race, gender, identity, and belonging. The writing is beautiful and poignant, flowing smoothly along while guiding the reader from one insightful observation to another. What a powerful read, indeed.  4 book reviews: That was the problem: you could never love two people the exact same way. Her blessing had been doomed from the beginning, her girls as impossible to please as jealous gods.  I can see now why everyone is raving about this book. The Vanishing Half has unforgettable characters, complex familial ties, long-lost sisters, tragedy, and romance. Very compelling (I was hooked straight away) and beautifully-written.  I think this book works so well because the author has very carefully and thoughtfully balanced out a deeply sad story about families torn apart and race-- and how different life could and can be for those able to pass as white --with stories of love and triumph. At the same time as my heart was aching for Desiree or Jude, I was smiling as Early found Desiree again, and rejoicing at the strength of the bond between Jude and Reese.  The story is about twin sisters, Desiree and Stella, who one day decide to run away from their small town and go to the city to find a new life for themselves. A few years later, Desiree comes back to her mother 's house with a child in tow, while Stella disappears to who-knows-where to pursue a life passing as a white woman. Desiree never stops looking for her twin, her other half, even as life sets them on such completely different paths.  Spanning years and generations, the book follows first the twins and then their daughters.  There 's a lot of nuance given to the exploration of race and colourism in this book. Stella is a fascinating character, nursing a lot of internalized anti-blackness as she plays this role of a white woman. Her own internalized racism stems from a horrific event she witnessed as a child, causing her to seek safety and freedom behind a shield of whiteness.  The different perspectives of the novel allow us as the reader to see Stella through an outsider 's eyes-- as someone selfish and racist, who would abandon or betray others for her own sake --and also through her own eyes-- as someone terrified, desperate for a chance at something more than what life has dealt her.  A great book to read, think about, discuss, and then read again.  5 book reviews: Brit Bennett 's intricate plot lines and ability to weave family dramas that stretch through years is definitely something to be admired. My only wish is that her characters would jump off the page a bit more rather than just remain vessels/outlines for her stories to play out through. However, I think this book deserves much of the hype it has received and the complex look it provides at race, identity, and motherhood (among other things) while remaining very accessible is truly where it 's at.  New auto-read author? Methinks yes.  6 book reviews: Although the first 1/3 of the book was slow, once we start to see how two generations diverge and they connect later on, I became invested in each person 's individual journeys as they grappled with race, loneliness, colorism, abuse, motherhood, and a sense of identity. I enjoyed reading about these women and also adored the male side characters (Reese makes me so soft!) It s a poignant and lovely story that takes you through several lifetimes with empathy and hope.  7 book reviews: Completely absorbing. Intricate prose. Deep characterization. Bennett exceeded my expectations with her second novel. 8 book reviews: I went into this book with high expectations, considering that I hadn t seen one single negative review; everyone loved it and found it important and was mind-blown by the quality of the writing. But then I read it myself and found, instead, just a story told at the speed of light as the author jumps in time and does not tie any end to any of her characters  life chapters, as well as a plethora of characters out of whom none experience any in-depth analysis or development. I will put it simply:    - White passing is a relatively new theme in contemporary novels (as far as I m concerned), and I think Bennett did a good job at highlighting the issue. However, I found it that it was only well-presented and analysed in the beginning, when we see the differences in perception of the two sisters. These differences between them were always painstakingly parallel to one another: one marries a dark-skinned man, the other does the opposite; one ends up running away from an abusive companion and finds love with a man she refuses to marry, the other happily marries and finds understanding in spite of her odd behaviour; one comes back to her childhood village and rejoices in a simple life as a bartendress, the other lives a wealthy life in a wealthy district. In the latter parts of the novel, I wished to see more of Stella s own viewpoint and motives. She remained reluctant and confused throughout the narrative, as we are revealed (as with all the other characters) only some heads up information that would allow us to continue reading. The main idea that you get about why Stella chooses to become white is because she can, and because it offers her a chance at a life that she deems ideal. But until the end, these problematic ideals are not dealt with. When the two sisters finally find each other again, Desiree quickly forgives Stella (I know they are sisters and have some kind of bond, and blood is thicker than water, and all that stuff about family being the most important, but Stella dismissed Desiree and left her behind for so many years, only to come back with the sole motive of begging her sister to talk down Jude into leaving Kennedy alone).  I don t have a term of comparison for the theme of white passing (I do plan on reading Nella Larsen s Passing). But I did not enjoy the fact that the theme is not fully exploited. I sincerely think this is not a case of a white person wishing to be given all these sides of a problem on a plate. But I do not think Stella s motives were exploited much beyond her childhood realization that she could pass for white, and her deep fears of being caught in the act. I enjoyed certain scenes that showed how guilty she felt, and her impostor syndrome, but I somehow still wanted a more in depth view, which may have been easier to achieve from a first person narrative.    - The characters were uni-dimensional, I felt them as strangers until the end. The few bits about their inner life were played down, and sometimes you were even given information that would not help you in any way throughout the story. Equally, the characters only had one or two traits that defined them throughout the whole book, and some of them did not even act like actual people, only tools for someone else s  arc . Stella was a liar with a very confused behaviour. Desiree was an uplifting woman that had her own emotional issues. Here, we don t know much about Early, because he is only in the story to bring some happiness into Desiree s life. Jude was a stubborn smart girl, who is present only to discover Stella and to tell Kennedy the truth about her family. Kennedy was a spoiled and rebellious girl and we know she is a talented actress, too. Audrey is just killed off in the end.  - Every 2-3 chapters or so, the narrative would jump ahead 10 years or so in time. There was no linearity, as the author only wanted you to know this nice emotional story, but would not care to fill you in on what went on behind the curtain, what the characters really FELT.  - The story is full to the brim with them. Characters manage to magically meet each other, in spite of how unrealistic that is (take Early s fortunate meeting with the girl he fell in love with as a little boy, and Jude meeting Kennedy, among others). I know things like these happen in books, but they rather happen in fairytales or rom-coms or children s books, hardly in books nominated for literary awards, I would say?  - There is a trans character in this book and we do not get much from him besides being shown his insecurities and his wish to have a surgery. He is a tool used for debating Jude s romantic life and her fears of entering an abusive relationship like that of her mother s. Reese is a ticked box for LGBTQ+ diversity. We don t even see him talk too often, besides the moments when he is a good boyfriend to Jude.  Before the end of this, I should mention that my antipathy towards the style of this book may be a subjective thing. I am usually into first-person narratives or stream of consciousness novels, where I am given a full spectrum of a character s inner world. I don t usually read books that only tell stories and jump from one character to another and I always expect some character development or for the book to dwell on feelings, thoughts, hidden motives, allowing the reader to have his own opinion, and not being served a cardboard character on a plate.  Lastly, I am white. I understand that my perception of this book may come from a place of privilege, of being given a story of four Black women whose experience I cannot fully grasp, as my own has been and will always be completely different. I have checked myself for all of the flaws I found in the book and do not consider they have to do with a racial bias, but rather with the way the story is told. There is an analysis of racial identity that helped me better understand the issue, and I am glad I read the book. However, I did not fully engage with the story and I do see why the book is popular. I just think it is a little bit overhyped.  9 book reviews: 3.5  Two Black twins, so  light  they could  pass  for White.  And, this story exploring   PASSING  - a term I was not familiar with.  One of the twins will choose to do just that-live life as a White woman.  Her husband will never know the truth. She will not get to celebrate milestones with her twin sister or mother. She will not be able to share her heritage with her own daughter.  I found this book to be profoundly SAD.  IMAGINE believing that it would be worth LOSING all of that, to be WHITE?  I enjoyed the first half of this book, when I learned about  Passing  and the story focused on the twin sisters..Desiree and Stella.  The second half was not as strong for me, when the story shifted to their daughters, Jude and Kennedy, and the focus of race and  passing  became diluted with another theme, regarding a character named Reese.  I understand it was another way to explore  Identity .  But, the book would ve been more powerful for ME if the narratives had remained with the sisters-I wanted to spend more time with Desiree after she returned home-  So we could see both her struggles and also the riches that she DID have- by having Adele, Jude, Early and the community of Mallard in her life.  So that we could compare, and contrast, their two choices in more depth. To fully explore  PASSING .  I needed to feel more of the PAIN (of EACH sister) that resulted from Stella s choice..  As I wondered how many women who chose to PASS, would choose that path again?  Relevant Timely.  Available now!!  Thank you to the publisher for providing a digital ARC through Edelweiss in exchange for a candid review!  10 book reviews: Everyone on earth spent the entirety of 2020 telling everyone else that this book is excellent and brilliant and a must read, and then I showed up deeply and profoundly late to the party only to say the same thing.  And in case you needed one more person telling you the same thing to push you over the edge - this is truly good stuff.  I took a while to warm up to it, but basically reading this book is suddenly being adopted into a family and at first you are like \"??? what is this what is happening and why should I care,\" but once you settle in and allow everyone and everything to grow on you...boom.  Then this cast of characters is a set of loved ones to you, and you feel their pain and are invested in their stories, and it 's wonderful.  And very sad. Obviously.  Like life or whatever...I do not know. Insert some powerful truism or trite clich  or other fitting expression here.  Bottom line: All I have to say is what everyone else did: good things!  -------------------   finishing this felt like saying goodbye to my family.  review to come / 4.5 stars  -------------------   my favorite way to feel stupid is by highly anticipating a book forever but not picking it up and then not being able to put it down when i finally do  11 book reviews: I am not sure I have words for how excellent this book turned out to be, but terms such as \"breathtaking, poignant, and ultimately hopeful\" come to mind. I was constantly reminded of the golden oldie movie Imitation of Life (1959) in regards to the discussions surround race, class, and gender, while also featuring a plot thread where a light skinned Black teenager is living her life passing as white. If you are wary of the hype, like I typically am, please know this is one instance where the substantial amount of praise is fully warranted, and I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story that is equal parts educational and entertaining.  12 book reviews: Technically I would rate this 3.5 stars.  This story is primarily centered on a set of twins born in Mallard, Louisiana. The twins run away from home to make it big in the city when one of the twins runs off and begins her life as a white person while the other twin goes through life as a black person. This story follows this set of twins through life as well as their daughters.  This book touched on some very deep issues: race, generations, transsexuality which was refreshing because I have not read a tremendous amount of books on theses issues. In many ways it is a high-quality retelling of Passing by Nella Larsen. That being said the pacing of this book was OFF. In the first 100 pages, it seemed slow. I saw Read With Cindy 's Review where she said the first 1/3 of the book was slow but it picked up. Because she is really honest (trust me on this or go watch her videos), I had confidence in her. It did get better, but I still would not classify this as a page turner. The ending was entirely predictable.  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities    13 book reviews: oooh, goodreads choice awards finalist for best historical fiction 2020! what will happen?

ALTHOUGH if we re being super-duper honest, and were both 4s going in (but 4.5s in my heart) that got bumped up to fives when rereading them for the review made me remember how dingdang good they were. this one was a five out of the gate.  it s so good i don t even know where to start. it s a family saga that takes place over the course of forty or so years, beginning in 1938 with the birth of twin sisters stella and desiree vignes in the town of mallard, louisiana; a black community with an unusual beginning:    the residents embraced their founder s dream of , and by the time the vignes girls his great-great-great-granddaughters are born, his bloodline has been bleached into  creamy skin, hazel eyes, [and] wavy hair,\" none of which attributes protect them from racism; from seeing their father lynched in their home when they are little girls, or from race factoring into their lives and shaping their opportunities when they run away from home as teenagers.  they live together in new orleans for a few years before stella abruptly cuts ties with her sister and disappears into a new life that she will live as a white woman marrying a wealthy white man and raising a daughter who has no idea she 's anything but white. meanwhile, desiree will leave the abusive father of her own daughter and move back to mallard, her child 's exceptional darkness there unexpected, unwelcome.  eventually, three generations of paths will cross, secrets will be discovered, everyone will have to address their choices.  honestly, i don t want to blah and blah about plot i always spend way too much time on silly reviews, writing 20-page dissertations on minutiae that nobody cares about but meeeee before deleting all of it anyway and i need to stop being foolish with my time and learn to do things in miniaturized efficiency when i m not getting paid.  but i will say that this is a tremendous second novel after a really impressive debut and bennett writes beautifully about family and grief and identity and being deeply, unbearably lonely the loneliness of the estranged twins, the self-othering loneliness isolating stella her old life and her new one, the loneliness of growing up dark in a colorstruck town etc etc. i am doing it again so i am gonna shut myself up now because i loved every little bit of this novel and we could be here all day if i do not put a stop to it now.  ***************************  was good, this one is GOLD.  review to come ASAP.  *******************************  my SECOND goodreads-win of 2020!!  this is the only good thing in the world right now.   14 book reviews: 4.5 Stars 15 book reviews: I am thinking 2.5/5  It was interesting but I was bored as all hell 16 book reviews:  She was always inventing her life.   Twin sisters. Two different paths: One chooses black. The other white. Their choices reflect societal norms, gender constructs, and racial inequality in contemporary America.  Stella and Desiree grow up in Mallard, LA. Mallard, a town comprised of light-skinned black people, has a fascinating history. When the sisters run away to New Orleans, they see their escape as a time to reinvent themselves:  Stella chooses to pass as white. Her choice allows her to live a life filled with opportunity and privilege. At the same time, she is without her family. She is perpetually uncomfortable and is teetering on the edge of someone finding out her secret, so she makes the effort to bury her true self and live a life built on fragile lies. Most significantly, she chooses a life without her other half, her sister.  Desiree s choices result in her being stuck; stuck in a town she can t leave, without a career, without a life. Nearly broken from her sister s choice to leave her, she never gives up hope of finding Stella until it s nearly too late.  Through Stella and Desiree s choices, Bennett juxtaposes race, gender, class, and sexuality.  The Vanishing Half is a thought-provoking, complex, and timely read. I was entranced by Desiree and Stella s stories, and I know I will be thinking about these characters for a long time.  I received an ARC of this book from Edelweiss and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.  17 book reviews: This is a thought provoking story and a few scenes were not easy to read. There s racism here, a violent incident against a man, witnessed by his young twin daughters, and more trauma for one of the girls than we want to imagine. This and their upbringing in a small black community in Louisiana where people believe the lighter they are the better life will be. So it wasn t a surprise that when twin sisters Desiree and Stella Vignes run away at sixteen, that their futures would take them on journeys seeking their identities. Although inseparable as young girls, they part ways and their chosen lives take very different paths. While it s easy to connect with Desiree and the choices she makes, it s not very easy to accept how Stella has chosen to live a lie and was most of the time unlikable. Yet, I was still drawn to her and felt for her, trying to understand her more.  While racial identity is the core of the story, there are so many other layers here with characters that the author portrays in such a way that I got a sense of who they were, even if at times they questioned their own identities. The story is told from multiple points of view - the sisters Desiree and Stella and later their daughters, Jude and Kennedy, each of them searching it seemed, to find their true selves. It s about different kinds of relationships between sisters, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, women and the men in their lives, cousins who find each other. There are other elements to the story such as spousal abuse and sexual identity. Almost all of the characters found a way to my heart. I found this to be such a well written story that captivated me from the first page and made me want to get to Britt Bennett s debut novel , which has been on my list.   As always I m grateful to read along with Diane and Esil. I love our discussions and sharing our perspectives .  I received an advanced copy of this book from Riverhead/Penguin through EdelweissZ  18 book reviews: Winner of Best Historical Fiction in the 2020 Goodreads Choice Awards  The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett features black twin sisters, whose skin is so light that they can pass for white. The sisters have always been close, almost like one person, even though they are so different, in personalities. When they are sixteen, they escape their small Louisiana town, to make new lives in New Orleans. At some point, Stella is able to get a job working for a white man and she envisions real freedom, if she abandons everything about her past and passes as a white person. Her sister Desiree is stunned and heartbroken that her sister would walk out on her and everything they have been for each other, their entire lives.  This story follows Stella, passing as a white woman, wife of a wealthy white man, mother of a blond headed daughter. Once Stella walks away from her birth family, she can never speak about them or contact them again, because her entire life is a lie. Although she now has so many freedoms that were not hers as a black person, she has sacrificed the family and the past that she left. This freedom that she has gained is also a kind of prison and a weight on her shoulders that can never be lifted.  The story also follows Desiree, who eventually marries a black lawyer and has a very dark skinned black daughter. Her husband is abusive and at some point Desiree must flee with her daughter, back to Mallard and her family home. Back to the home where she grew up in poverty, possessing barely more than the clothes on their backs and no money. The contrast between Stella 's path and Desiree 's path could not be more glaring.  Over the decades we get to see how the choices of Stella and Desiree affect the people around them...their daughters, the men in their lives, their neighbors, friends, and family. I enjoyed the story of Stella and Desiree and also the stories of their daughters and how they dealt with their hopes, dreams, mistakes, and the consequences of their actions. I was so drawn to some of the characters and wish I could name them but I do not want to spoil the story. There are men in this story that are weak in their destructiveness but there are men in this story that are strong with their compassion and loyalty. I think the men made the story for me, as much as the women did.  Thank you to Riverhead Books/Penguin Publishing Group and Edelweiss for this ARC.  19 book reviews: Sooooo GOOD!!!  ...Pathos and Pain.... ...Profound Thoughtfulness... ...Spellbinding prose.... ...Surprises I never saw coming... ...A book that kept me interested and curious from start to finish... ...Filled with substantial depth and insights.  Brit Bennett brings to life characters that made me desperately want to vanish into the her storytelling world.  Meet twin sisters, Desiree and Stella Vignes. They grew up in a Black Community - a town so small - it couldn t be found on a map: Mallard, Louisiana. At age 16 they ran away together to New Orleans....   A fascinating tale begins .....dealing with identity, racism, choices! That s all I m saying!  A wonderful novel to Go in Blind!!!  There is nothing not to like about this book. It promises to tickle your interest bones!!!  Highly recommended - great book club pick!  It s irresistible!   *Brit Bennett s first novel,  The Mother s  was wonderful....received much recognition....a terrific enjoyable book, too.... This 2nd book,  The Vanishing Act ...is even better!  Congrats to Brit. She outdid herself.    20 book reviews: Soooo...first I gave this book 4.5 stars. I have no idea where to even begin with my review.  The Vanishing Half is such a complex and timely novel. Colorism and being \"white passing\" has been and still remains a hot topic of discussion in the Black community. Brit Bennett brings both of these conversations to the forefront in a interesting way. The novel focuses on twins, Desiree and Stella, who grow up in a small town where they are forced to quit school at the age of 16 to help provide an income for their family. Unable to take the burden placed on them by their mother, the girls decide to leave for New Orleans. It 's there that each decides to take a new path with their life. Desiree ends up marrying a dark skin man and having a daughter, while Stella decides to pass as white and marry a white man.  The psychology behind the assumptions and stereotypes placed on both narratives is rather intriguing. What I found most unique was the internalized hatred and racism that Black characters had for other Black characters based on how dark their skin was. Dark skin Black individuals are characterized as lazy and problematic while those that were lighter are treated with higher regard. In real life, a lot of those assumptions, thoughts, and feelings still linger. It was particularly interesting to see the advantages that Stella received once she was able to build her life around the lie that she was white. As much as it hurt me to see how much she hated her own blackness, I could not help but wonder how stressful and painful it was for her to pretend to be White and give up everything and everyone she loved. The amount of work it even took for Stella to maintain this lie throughout the novel made me exhausted. In comparison, Desiree lived a much simpler life; however, her daughter struggled with her identity as a child, teen, and adult because she was of a darker complexion. She had insecurities not only about the way she look, but also her self-worth. There were quite a few times where she continuously questions whether she is worthy of love.  The characterization and addition of Jude (Desiree 's daughter) and Kennedy (Stella 's daughter) made the novel even more interesting. Their comparison of their lives made me wonder if Bennett was attempting to say that owning one 's Blackness is not as unfortunate as some would like to paint it to be. I am usually weary of one books attempt to address so many different perspectives over a large expanse of time, but of course Bennett was able to beautifully weave in each story without losing my attention or interest. The amount of topics that she was able to address in such a short period of time just sang to my soul. I have read her first book The Mothers, but now I know I need to pick it up again and buy a physical copy of this one.  I would say that everyone needs to read this book. It is such an important insight to such an important series of topics and Bennett, as always, handles each with such care. This is definitely going down as one of my favorite books of 2020. I did take off half a star because the ending was not what I was expecting or what I necessarily wanted. Other than that, this book is phenomenal!  21 book reviews: not going to lie - it took me awhile to really warm up to this story. and honestly, im not sure i really did.  i could immediately appreciate the heart of it, but goodness me. nonlinear narratives and 25+ page chapters are the bane of my existence. so i was worried that i might not be able to push through this, even with the lovely writing and important content.  like i said, there are so many great themes throughout this book and its honestly no surprise why so many readers have connected with this story. i just wish personal writing preferences hadnt prevented me from enjoying this more.  definitely a case of   22 book reviews: 2020 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I. . F.A.B.  I was excited that this was our bookclub pick for this month.   I ve read so many fabulous reviews about the important messages this book has to offer. It tells a story of a set of twins, who runaway at 16. They take two different paths in life. Not giving much away- it was a great read.  I d say I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half. The messages are definitely good: Family is family, acceptance of who you are is important, even more so- acceptance of others is imperative.    23 book reviews: \"She was black. Blueblack. No, so black she looked purple. Black as coffee, asphalt, outer space, black as the beginning and the end of the world.\"  Another good story about sisters. This one is so worth the hype. Different, unique and important.  *Warnings for domestic violence, sexual assault, racist remarks, Alzheimer 's   In this story, we are able to see racism and discrimination does exist within a community of the same race and colour.  I find the story quite good, the writing convincing and the characters inside your head beating in your heart like you know them from the very beginning till the end.  I find the ending a bit underwhelming with all the anticipation that was there for the ending (we all know what I am talking about. The great moment of reunion. But it did not leave me the effect that would make it memorable and emotional for me.)  My favourite character would be Jude, closely followed by Reese and Early though the story is told more about Stella and her twin sister, Desiree.  A book worth the hype after all.  24 book reviews: Ah it 's 100% making that FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2023 list. Do not put it on your TBR, read it now   GO!!!  I have just finished the book so I am super emotional and I feel like rambling! This is a beautiful heart-warming (and wrenching) story about loving and losing, then loving some more and losing again. It speaks about important topics (racial inequality, gender identity, homophobia, family, social and financial issues) in such a simple, everyday, \"Normal People by Sally Rooney\" kinda way. Nothing is too bad or too good to be true. Even though I am not a person of color and would never try to compare mine with struggles of these characters, I still am allowed to say that I really feel like this book spoke to me on so many levels. It 's so easy to look at in and out of context, it 's a story about everyone and no one in particular. Read this if you do not know who you are or if you are having doubts about certain aspects of your identity. We live in a society that tries to take from us every single aspect of our uniqueness, but it 's our origin (culture, morals, thoughts) that is adding to the beauty of this world. Do not ever forget that    25 book reviews: Shortlisted for the Women s Prize 2021  The Vanishing Half is a quintessential book club book. That might sound pejorative, but please trust me, I don t mean it to. It s a really, really good book that just happens to be a perfect storm of all the things that book clubs generally like.  This novel is getting a LOT of buzz, so that s a good start. Book clubs like things that are buzzy. It also sits comfortably in either the literary fiction or commercial fiction category, so it has a broad appeal. Plus, it s topical and endlessly discussable.  The setting is fascinating a town called Mallard, founded by a freed slave with the express objective of  lightness . A  third place  during a time of binary segregation, a place for those who ; a sort of opt-in eugenics experiment where residents aim to create ever-lighter generations of children. Mallard is the jumping-off point for Bennett to explore, not only race, but colourism, complex racial hierarchies and the many nuances of privilege and prejudice.  Twins Stella and Desiree both reject Mallard s strictures, but in totally different ways. Desiree marries while Stella  passes  for white, cutting all ties for the sake of her reinvention. Physically identical, the twins  lives chart very different courses.  From there we have an almost soap-opera-worthy plot of buried secrets, coincidences, fake identities, dramatic reunions. Each of the twins has a daughter and through this second generation we can see just how widely fortunes and relative privilege diverge  all because of an arbitrary social construct. The characters are drawn with rather bold brushstrokes (Desiree: stoic; Stella: tortured; Jude: sweet & insecure; Kennedy: brash & spoiled) but they are well-rounded enough to sweep the story along.  does what it sets out to do very well. It s serious without being heavy, breezily readable without lacking substance, and a likely contender for this year s prize lists. An engrossing novel that is sure to be just as enjoyable to dissect at book club as it is to read.  26 book reviews: \"You could never quite get used to loneliness...\"  Identical twin sisters, Desiree, and Stella Vignes were born in Mallard, Louisiana, a town so small it cannot be found on the map. They have witnessed atrocities inflicted upon their father at a young age. They decide to run away from their southern black community at the age of 16 and start over in New Orleans. Years later, Desiree returns to her hometown with her young daughter while her twin sister Stella, is living as a white woman and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Desiree longs for her sister who left without saying goodbye.  Both twins  lives go in separate directions. Once Stella leaves, neither knows what became of the other. Their lives; however, are intertwined (their daughter 's lives intertwine) as this book moves from the deep south to the east coast, and to California from the 1950s to the 1990s. This is a story about love, family, mothers, daughters, acceptance, racism, how race shapes individuals' lives. This book also touches on domestic violence, gender identity, racial identity, and acceptance.  This book gives us various characters with distinct personalities and POVs. We not only read but feel their pain, their heartache, their loneliness, their happiness, and their strength. I found this to be a beautifully written and thought-provoking book.  This was my first book by Brit Bennett, and it will not be my last.  I received a copy of this book from the Editor and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.  27 book reviews: 4.5 stars The Vignes twins are identical but they couldn t be more different in personality. This is the story of light-skinned black twins whose lives take very different paths.  The twins grew up in the odd little fictional southern town of Mallard where the blacks found dark skin undesirable. The lighter they were, the better, and the dark-skinned blacks faced discrimination from the light-skinned ones.  As young children, the twins endure a trauma when they see their father lynched by white men. This changes the trajectory of their lives. Eventually the girls strike out on their own. Stella chooses to break ties with her family,  pass over , and live as a white. She marries a wealthy white man and has a white, blond-haired daughter, Kennedy. Desiree makes a bad choice in a husband but eventually returns home to her hometown with Jude, her very dark black daughter.  I don t want to ruin the story and give away too much, so I ll keep this light on plot. What is it like for Desiree and Jude to live in a town that values light skin and discriminates against dark skin, when Jude is so very dark? How does this shape her? What is it like for Stella to live a lie, to live without relatives or childhood friends, without a history to share? Does her wealth and privilege bring contentment and happiness? She can never truly open up to anyone, not even her husband and daughter, for fear of exposing her true self. How does this shape her daughter Kennedy? What happens when a black family moves into Stella s very white, very wealthy neighborhood?  Their choices have far-reaching unintended consequences. Eventually, events transpire that threatens to destroy the life Stella has so carefully built. How she reacts and the effects on the daughters of Stella and Desiree comprise much of the second half of the book.  I found the first half a slow build up but the second half I blew through in an afternoon. The only things that kept me from giving this a full 5 stars were a few too many coincidences moving the plot forward and awkward transitions between chapters and characters. But, the strengths in this moving novel overshadows these small criticisms.  Powerful, thought-provoking, and profound, but told through such compelling, yet flawed, characters it doesn t read like an  issue  book. The subplot of identity is handled with depth and sensitivity.  Spanning decades, from the 1950s to the 1990s, this is an exploration of  passing . I had not heard this term used before and read more here:   Is the vanishing half losing your twin or is it losing the half of yourself you choose to deny and leave behind when you pass? Perhaps it s both. I love an introspective book that reveals the inner lives of characters. Days after finishing the book and I am still thinking about these characters and the issues raised.  Marialyce and I read this together and it inspired thoughtful, deep discussions. This would make a wonderful choice for a book club .  *I received a free digital copy of this book via Edelweiss. All opinions are my own.  28 book reviews: This book is getting a lot of buzz, so I was pleased that our book club chose it and gave me an excuse to pick it up. I had just finished The Warmth of Other Suns and this novel fit nicely onto its back. What hit me first is that racism is so ingrained in our culture that even among blacks, light is better. Desiree and Stella Vignes are identical twins, raised in a small town in 1950s Louisiana. They are light skinned in a town of other light skinned blacks. They run away at age 16, first to New Orleans, then further afield. In DC, Stella makes the choice to pass as white. The book takes on all aspects of identity. Not just race, but sexual, cultural, and economic. It addresses our public vs. private selves, of what we show to others, even our closest loved ones, vs. how we see ourselves. Bennett does an amazing job of having each and every character feel real. I found myself caring not just for the sisters and the daughters, but secondary characters like Easy, Reese and Barry. It boggles the mind to think what it s like to live a lie like Stella does - to walk away from one 's past, to deny so much of who you are, to have to keep one 's current family and friends constantly at arm s length. She s not always a likeable character, but she s definitely a sympathetic one. This was a book club selection and it should make for a wonderful discussion. I listened to this and have to admit to sometimes struggling with Shayna Small s southern accent. Not that it s inauthentic, just that I didn t always understand the words being said. But she provides a great range of voices from those Louisiana drawls to Kennedy s California girl.  29 book reviews: Update: This is heavily inspired by Nella Larsen s Passing, which is a far better book, imo.  Carving destiny  What are you going to be when you grow up? Preschoolers love trying different roles and goals: dragon, dragon-slayer, train-driver, astronaut, alien, or elf. The boundary between real and imaginary worlds is delightfully blurred and permeable: my kid wanted me to buy real cat food for their imaginary cat!  Who are you? In adolescence, reality intrudes. If we want to pretend, it s usually under the guise of acting. Most of us want to fit in - but only when we ve figured out who we want to fit in : the cool kids, the geeks, the rebels, the arty types, or the campaigners.   : (Sources: and )  Those are universal experiences, but a few people realise that attributes assigned and assumed from birth do not fit. Colour is the headline theme of this book: a black woman living as white. But many characters change identities: a trans man, a white drag queen who is a black man, an actor who is  , and realtor who tells potential buyers:   That s a sales pitch. Creating a new present and future can erase your past, and separate you from family. It can be a high price.      This is a startling novel, ostensibly about passing (as white) in 1960s-1980s USA. Stella and Desiree are light-skinned identical twins who end up with utterly different lives: one living as black and the other passing as white (not a spoiler). Chapters switch between their shared childhood, separate adulthood, and the lives of their daughters.    It 's about cleaving together and apart. About the duality of twinship: one person in two bodies, and then, perhaps, both versions in one body. About the price of secrets and love that manifests itself in lies and even abuse. About hiding and hunting.             : ()  This was what I found most fascinating. Denying one s heritage is a loss and perhaps betrayal, and there are practical things to learn, like different cuisine and language. However, I hadn t considered the much deeper and more painful aspects which are so carefully portrayed.    Stella lives in perpetual and increasing fear of being found out. It s desperately lonely. She s scared of black people:   She s scared of pregnancy, lest a baby be too dark.   Is it worth it?    Exposing my own ignorance, as a white Brit:    I was slightly confused that the words  black ,  colored , and  Negro  seem to be used interchangeably (and the other N-word is occasionally used as a slur), whereas I tend to think of  colored  as an insulting term for being mixed or bi-racial.    A few months ago, I d have barely noticed these neutral descriptions, especially when penned by a contemporary author of colour:  , a   woman, and  . However, they stood out because of the recent controversy about similar terms used by a white British author about her pupils, Kate Clanchy s . I never thought  chocolate-coloured skin  and  almond-shaped eyes  were the worst of her descriptions, but it s not for me to decide. See my review, , for details and quotes.      Nella Larsen s 1929 novel, , which contrasts the adult lives of childhood friends, one of whom later opts to pass as white. Now that I have read that, I am downrating this to 3* because Larsen 's original is so much better and this borrows so much from it, then pads it with unnecessary box-ticking subplots. See my review .    Bernardine Evaristo s , which I didn t enjoy, makes interesting points by reversing the races in the slave trade. See my review .    is a white woman who passed as black and even became a chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.    Zen Cho s features colourism and fitting in. See my review .    Toni Morrison s . See my review .      Physical abuse, and the lasting trauma of witnessing it, are mentioned, though not in graphic detail or at great length.    When the trans character first appeared, I thought it might be an awkward and heavy-handed comparison with Stella s transition to being white, but he was a fully-formed and important character in the story.  The big weakness, imo, is that the plot relies on two coincidences, whose improbability is compounded by a character needing to remember details of the first one for it to work.       In Mallard, nobody married dark. Nobody left either.      Lightness, like anything inherited at great cost, was a lonely gift.      If nothing could be done about ugliness, you ought at least to look like you were trying to hide it.      Maybe pretending to be white eventually made it so.      All there was to being white was acting like you were.      The only difference between lying and acting was whether your audience was in on it.      Why can t you just be yourself?  Stella asked once.  Maybe I don t know who that is.      Her death hit in waves. Not a flood, but water lapping steadily at her ankles. You could drown in two inches of water. Maybe grief was the same.   ",
    " The Very Hungry Caterpillar": "book reviews: I actually gave this book 5 stars, but the very hungry caterpillar ate one of them.  Also, did anyone else get a defective book? My version has a bunch of holes in it. 1 book reviews: RIP Eric Carle who died today aged 92.  Former president George W. Bush named this his favorite book from childhood (it came out when he was 23 ... but perhaps he meant his kids' childhood). In any event it 's one of my favorites from my childhood, and from reading to my own kids. Was it the first to put holes through its pages? Probably not, but it worked very well. Kids like sticking their fingers in things - genius!  Anyhow - this is one HUNGRY caterpillar! He puts a hole through everything be it a slice of watermelon (or wacca menon as my daughter first said it), ice cream cone, or sausage.  It is in fact one of the bestselling books in the history of literature!      So what does this epic teach us?  1/ Everything in moderation. Our caterpillar just sticks a single hole in each food item - he ai not that sort of greedy, he will leave some for others.  2/ Try new things. Our caterpillar ai not picky, he will try anything once, even gherkin!  3/ Eat healthy to avoid stomach ache. A nice green leaf will sort you out.  4/ Change is good. Straighten up and fly right and you too could become a beautiful butterfly and... um ... fly, right!           ..  2 book reviews: no fucking way he can eat that much 3 book reviews: [Book #11 for my grad school Children 's Lit class] 4 book reviews: Fun fact for today? A famous picture book, described as  one of the greatest childhood classics of all time  was actually inspired by   a simple hole punch!  Yes, incredibly, it s true. The author remembers:   One day I was punching holes with a hole puncher into a stack of paper, and I thought of a bookworm and so I created a story called  A Week with Willi the Worm.   But his editor suggested that readers may not like a green worm very much, and suggested a caterpillar instead. The idea appealed to Eric Carle, and is the result.  But did it begin there, or did it end? It s rather like the chicken and the egg ...  The story starts on a moonlit night, with a tiny egg on a leaf. On the next morning, which is Sunday, a tiny red-faced caterpillar pops out of the egg. He s very hungry, so he begins to look for some food. Over the next five days we see him eating through more and more fruit. There s an apple on Monday, two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, four strawberries on Thursday, and five oranges on Friday   and then, on Saturday, he gobbles down an enormous feast of all sorts of silly food:    Of course by the end of the day, he feels very ill indeed, with a stomach ache. The next day though, another Sunday, he goes back to his more sensible diet, and eats through a large green leaf. He s now a very big fat caterpillar! He spins a little house round himself called a cocoon and stays in there for a whole fortnight. And after that is the magic, which will entrance all young children, as of course the illustration shows the caterpillar emerging, transformed into a beautiful butterfly with large, glorious, multi-coloured wings.  This is a wonderful book for very young children. It introduces sound educational themes such as counting, the days of the week, foods, (although Saturday s feast is a bit of a fantasy!) and the life cycle and transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly. It is simple but accurate, and has been endorsed by the  Royal Entomological Society .  It has to be said though, that its charm and novelty is its greatest asset. The pages are differently shaped, and have holes punched through to represent the caterpillar s trail as he eats through all the various foods. Although was first published in 1969, apparently it has sold the equivalent of a copy per minute ever since (30 million copies worldwide). It has won many awards for children s literature, and also a major graphic design award. Eric Carle not only wrote it, but also designed and illustrated the book.  Quite an achievement, then, for a book which was inspired by a simple hole punch!  5 book reviews: I somehow picture myself reading it to my grandkids with this disclaimer:  The moral of the story is that while caterpillars can eat themselves into a food coma and come out the other end as a butterfly, humans who do that will come out the other end with type 2 diabetes.    You are welcome, kids.  6 book reviews: Hungry is as hungry does.  Eric Carle 's vision of metamorphosis is more hand-painted collage and less existential nightmare compared to that of Franz Kafka.  Our hero of the story, the caterpillar, is indeed hungry. Very hungry. He even eats his way through the pages of the book itself.  All this eating is for a purpose, leading to his beautiful metamorphosis, which is finally revealed on the last page. (Spoiler alert!)  I have so many fond memories of Eric Carle 's books, especially \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\" This is the book that spurred my own interest in entomology as a child. Every year I would find monarch caterpillars, feed them milkweed, and observe their seemingly magical transformation into beautiful butterflies. Each time a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, spreads its wings, and takes its first flight is like a small miracle before your very eyes.  Eric Carle 's artistic style is inimitable and immediately recognizable. You do not even need to read the name of the author on the cover of an Eric Carle book to know who wrote it.  He is also a gifted storyteller and know exactly how to capture children 's imagination and inspire them to discover the world around them.  7 book reviews: 8 book reviews: Eric Carle 's books have a special place in my heart. The way he creates his illustrations makes them so colorful and appealing to all.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one of our favorite books by him, but we enjoy them all equally. Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?, The Grouchy Ladybug, The Very Busy Spider, The Very Quiet Cricket, and Dream Snow are just a few of our most cherished Eric Carle books.  When you witness a toddler who ca not read, recite all the words to these stories, you know just how much they love them too!  5*****  9 book reviews: Eh. I have seen hungrier caterpillars. 10 book reviews: There are some books I m just not smart enough to read but, darnit, I challenged myself and I finally made it through The Very Hungry Caterpillar (after several false starts)! I m not gonna flatter myself that I unnerstood the depth of the ideas, themes and junk in it, but I liked the colours and pitchers and stuff   Oooooh man - lookit this lil guy! He eats an apple, two pears, three plums - he s a beast! Does he stop there? Nuh to the uh! Four strawberries and then FIVE - count it, FIVE - oranges. This unstoppable motherfucker.  And then shit gets really fucked up - all bets are off! Cake, ice cream, cherry pie, a lollipop - he is. Off. The. Chain! We ve all been there after a trying week - no judgements lil dude! I wonder if this book is inadvertently responsible for the  health at any size/fat acceptance  movement with its message of  eat like a pig and become beautiful! ?  I m not gonna spoil the ending of course but it s worth the journey. It seems predictable because he s a caterpillar but it leaves things wide open for a sequel. I mean, this guy is now more mobile than ever - what else is he gonna eat next? A pizza?! Two pizzas?? THRE - you re right, that s too much   You know what made me really laugh? My edition had a SUMMARY at the start! The summary was this large paragraph that was as long as the book s lines put together! Who needs a fucking summary for The Very Hungry Caterpillar? Who can t read this in no seconds flat and get the jist of it?! Which parent is looking at this wondering if it s suitable for their braindead sprog to dribble on?!  Anyways. This thing is still the greatest book about greedy caterpillars out there and rightly deserves its legendary status. Just don read it when you res dieting hawmahashsahwanasm   11 book reviews: I know everyone 's supposed to love this book, but I just do not see what 's so great about it. The character of the caterpillar is never properly developed, and he comes across as a one-dimensional parody of a larval form. The plot is dull and predictable, as is the language. I am not thrilled by the artwork.  If it were not for the fact that George W. Bush praised Caterpillar so highly, I would unhesitatingly call it vacuous, uninspired rubbish. I must be missing something, but what?  12 book reviews: Book Review 3+ of 5 stars to The Very Hungry Caterpillar, a children 's picture book published in 1969 and written by Eric Carle. I am sure someone read this book to me as a very small child, but I know for certain that I had it on my shelf and looked through it around 10-years old. It 's a delight for all ages with the cute illustrations, the physical design of the book and the quirky personality of the caterpillar.  It 's a useful tool to teach young children how a caterpillar grows up, eats all the food around to get his/her nutrients, builds a cocoon and emerges as a butterfly. A wonderful science exhibit and activity to grown your own butterflies, it can be a hands-on teaching experience too. Lovely memories and great things come from it.  It gained in popularity again when George Bush mentioned it in a speech or interview. It 's also got a few readers torn up in knots. You see, the caterpillar eats too much and gets ill and overweight, but emerges as a beautiful butterfly. People read into it, thinking kids will eat so much and become obese and sickly.  I will probably be hated for my next comment, but seriously? Relax. I do not think reading this book as a child will lead to such dire consequences. Wanna know why? Because if you are a parent or guardian, read it to your kid and explain the whole story... talk about the process of nature and metamorphosis. Discuss eating habits. Explain what real beauty is. Talk about what foods are good and what foods are bad. Show how when you eat too much, you can get sick. Teach balance. But do not hate on a book because it seems to say \"eat what you want and you will be beautiful even when you are sick.\" Oh, and read it with a child. Do not just put it in his/her hands and shove them out of the way. Make it an interactive experience so the right goals of the book are understood and accomplished.  Yikes, my reviews are getting more \"animated\" without even using GIFs. Off to get some lunch. Perhaps a box of cookies...

The main character has to overcome his ravenous appetite on his jouney to become a butterfly. There were were in my eyes and laughter too as I jouneyed with the catapillar in the greatest epic ever told. We had much to learn from the noble catapillar. 14 book reviews: The first time my baby ever laughed was while we were looking at the butterfly on the last page and I was talking to him about butterflies. Instant fave. 15 book reviews: There are a lot of children 's books that feel as if they are really written for the parents. The sort that kids tolerate but adults \"ooh and aah\" over feeling they are doing their parental duty by reading these fascinating works of children 's literature and enriching their lives, where the child really just wants to know how much Dragons Love Tacos. Almost all of Eric Carle 's work feels that way to me. I remember hating him as a kid, yet adults love to read him. Hell, go into any large book store and they practically set up a shrine to the man for consumers to pay homage before offering their tithe.  This book is the one exception to that list. It 's the one I liked as a kid and the only one I have bothered to buy for my daughter (for the record, I read to her just to see if maybe I was the weird one as a kid who hated them, and she showed zero interest in it). This one works with its creative design, the humorous word choices and the amazing day where it eats a random assortment of food. This is the one Carle book that actually seems fun for young readers rather than being just \"a work of art\".  Maybe I am coming off overly critical of him. Maybe I just do not \"get it\" but hey, at least there 's one exception  right? 4/5 stars  16 book reviews: I believe this book is THE MAJOR CAUSE of the childhood obesity epidemic currently sweeping the nation. Still, nice illustrations. 17 book reviews: SPOILER! He turns into a butterfly. 18 book reviews: Very differcult read. recommended for advance readers only. 19 book reviews: A favourite of both my children. My daughter had a board book version of this that she absolutely loved from about 6 months on. She loved the holes in each page and every single time we read it she had to pretend her little finger was the caterpillar and make eating noises at every hole, and when the butterfly emerges we had to make the book flap into the air. It 's not a realistic representation of a butterfly and obviously the butterfly is not eating usual butterfly food but this was a well loved book in our house for years.  20 book reviews: An intense and immersive breakdown of this juggernaut of complex literature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Szf... 21 book reviews: The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Eric Carle The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a children 's picture book designed, illustrated, and written by Eric Carle, first published in 1969. One Sunday morning, a caterpillar hatches from an egg. He is known as the Very Hungry Caterpillar, who loves eating, and so he begins to look for some food. He eats through increasing quantities of fruit on the following 5 days. First it 's one apple on Monday, then two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, four strawberries on Thursday, and finally, five oranges on Friday. On Saturday, he eats an enormous amount of food, including one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. Then that night, he gets a stomachache from overeating. But the next morning, it becomes Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one green leaf. And after that, he feels much better. At the end of that, he is not hungry anymore. He is neither hungry nor a little caterpillar. He is a big, fat, caterpillar. The now-big caterpillar spins a cocoon around himself. There, inside he sleeps in it for 2 weeks. Later, the caterpillar emerges as a butterfly with large, gorgeous, multi-colored wings.   :                                                        :          :   1986     :        :      :     [ ]:     1364    26        :                                                   -     20    :          :      :      :         1370    28           1372   :                :      :      :   1380             : 9649153942       :      :      :      :   1381    24    : 9649298932       :        :        :      :         1386    30        : 9789643059453   :        :        :       :      1395    14    : 9786005550573       :            :      :                              :    1397    14        : 9786007470497                                    .                                                      .                                                      .                    :                                .                                                       .                                .                          .                                                    .                    .                            .                                              :                                            .               1969                                                                            .                          .                .                                              .                                                                                                      .                                          .                        .                          .                              .                                                          .    :                                    .                              .                    .                                                                                    .                                        .                    .                          .                        .                            .   .    22 book reviews: Well this book brings tears to my eyes. I read this to my children nearly every day when they were little. They would point to the food and put their little fingers in the holes. I would have my hand on the other side of the page and tickle the pads of their finger. They would giggle and giggle. Thank you for this wonderful story, Eric, and rest in peace. 23 book reviews: RAPACIOUS CONSUMERISM WORKS!  EAT CAKE BE BEAUTIFUL 24 book reviews: A children 's book classic. I recently gave our old family copy back to my sister so that she could entertain my nephew with this thrilling tale but I soon started to miss the book in my own collection. Therefore, I opted to re-buy a miniature version, which is perfect for multiple reasons: it does not take up nearly as much space as the big picture book version which is targeted at kids but I still get to enjoy the story and look at the pictures.  Rereading this book literally takes 5 minutes but it actually made me wonder what the purpose of this story (if there is any) is. I mean we get to follow a very hungry caterpillar that eats and eats throughout the week, then sleeps in a cocoon and wakes up as a beautiful butterfly. Is this supposed to be a metaphor for children growing into adults? I literally have no clue. One thing that 's very evident are the patterns that come up in this book, especially those referencing days of the week and numbers. I can see how that 's useful as an early teaching tool for pre-school kiddos. Apart from that, the story seems quite nonsensical to me   which is fine, and honestly a breath of fresh air. Not every book aimed at children needs to be this huge morality tale.  Anyways, the gimmick that I always enjoyed the most about this book (as a kid and as an adult!) is that some of its pages have holes in them to illustrate how the caterpillar eats its way through the food. It 's so fun and clever. And little ol' 21st-century me is always fascinated when stuff like this is incorporated into books from literally 60-70 years ago. It 's good to know the kids were always having fun!  25 book reviews: One of the joys of becoming a parent is being able to revisit your own childhood favourites, this classic tale of the metamorphosis of a caterpillar to a butterfly is one of the earliest books I can remember as a kid and was the perfect place to start.  So simple and clever as it not only teaches children to count but also explains a part of the animal kingdom around them.  26 book reviews: Mr. H, my grandson, loves this book so much he turned it into a play. Great show! The critics (that would be me and his aunt) raved about it!   27 book reviews: As a three year old (in Germany, in 1969, and thus in the very same year the book was in fact published), I absolutely adored Eric Carle 's The Very Hungry Caterpillar (or I should rather say that I loved the German version of the book, that I found Die kleine Raupe Nimmersatt absolutely wonderful, and that I have in fact only read the English version but this one time, being today, and as a Kindle download). And if I therefore am mostly rating The Very Hungry Caterpillar with my memories of childhood and my inner child in mind, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is most definitely and always will be a full and glowing five stars for me.  But yes, as an adult, I do indeed and well understand that the main \"protagonist\" that the very hungry caterpillar is never in any manner textually and narratively developed as a character, that he remains rather flat and one-dimensional throughout, and that he also consumes mostly food products that are not even remotely suitable for caterpillars (as they basically consume mostly leaves). However, I also and absolutely know and realise for a fact that when I was three years old (and had repeatedly read to me), whether the list of foods the caterpillar was eating was suitable and acceptable for butterfly larvae or not did not matter all that much to me (if at all), and that for the intended audience, both the text and the accompanying images of are generally pure unadulterated joy, magic, and perhaps even perfection, with the final illustration, the beautiful and intensely coloured butterfly into which the erstwhile very hungry caterpillar morphs, being the ultimate icing on an already most delicious cake (and no food based pun is intended with this here allusion either).  And indeed, I do have so very many fond memories of both my mother and grandmothers repeatedly and always gladly reading to me (in German), with my most special and evocative, precious recollection being my mother 's mother taking the time to meticulously and slowly explain to me that caterpillars do not really eat chocolate cake and ice cream cones (that they consume leaves and grass, that chocolate and most of the other foods mentioned in the book would actually and likely make the caterpillars very sick) when I asked if I could feed chocolates to the caterpillars in the garden. So I guess with my remembered and recalled question to my grandmother in mind, I should perhaps offer this small caveat to parents that they might consider also letting their young children know that caterpillars do not and should not consume most of the food products mentioned and depicted in , lest they are like me and are curiously wondering whether the caterpillar 's presented and depicted consumption is realistic (and yes, I really did want to try and feed chocolates and ice cream cones to the caterpillars I had seen in grandmas 's garden and was a trifle disappointed at my grandmother 's answer to my question).  28 book reviews:                           ( )                .                                                                                 .                                                                    .                                                                              / /   29 book reviews:                                                                         (     )                         1969                        .                                   ...

    " The Wonky Donkey": "book reviews: So I jumped on the bandwagon and got this for my boys after seeing the video of the hilarious Scottish granny reading it to her grandson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...  Just try saying \"he was a stinky dinky lanky honky tonky winky wonky donkey\" out loud. If that does not make you laugh, try saying it once more, but in a Scottish accent. I endeavor to always read this in a Scottish accent - which makes most things better, if you ask me - and so far it seems to be working. My 2 year old giggles when I read and then asks me to read it again! Well, technically he says \"more honky donkey\", but one can hardly blame him when his mother has suddenly taken on a Scottish brogue.  Hee haw!  | | | |  1 book reviews: The Wonky Donky by Craig Smith is hilarious! It is also an internet sensation due to this grandmother reading it to her grandson....I was laughing so hard because she was laughing so hard! Check it out here! http://www.reshareworthy.com/granny-l... 2 book reviews: The video of that grandma reading this book to her grandson is hilarious. Go watch if you have not yet. :D 3 book reviews: I have mainly been buying the book that I can recall from my childhood for my daughter, but having seen that hilarious YouTube video of the Scottish gran trying to read this - we had to add it to the collection.  It 's such a fun tounge twister as the worlds flow wonderfully when read aloud. Theres a certain re-readability with this one which adds to the appeal, reckon this will be read numerous times over the coming months.  4 book reviews: Really hilarious and enjoyable book for children! Best when read out loud - highly recommend! 5 book reviews: Try to read this out loud ! I watched a lady read it to a baby and she kept laughing which made me laugh so much. I loved it. I want a copy for future kids and one for my niece. It s a good time! 6 book reviews: Looking for a book that will instill a lifelong phobia about birds in your child? Then look no further than The Wonkey Donkey, which somehow manages to make fun of amputees, the visually impaired, and those with gastrointestinal disorders, all while offering up questionable word definitions and making fart jokes. Oh, and showing a bird plucking the donkey 's eye out on the third spread. (Completely unnecessary. The first time we see the donkey, we only see him in profile. So he could have only had one eye; there 's no reason we had to see the bird carrying the eyeball away!)  I just could not get past that part. I mean, I read the rest of the book, but I was distracted, thinking about how little kids could potentially develop a debilitating fear about birds swooping down and plucking out their eyes. The rest of the book did little to redeem itself. It offered up stupid, nonsensical definitions of words like \"hanky-panky\" and \"spunky\". The former is often used in a sexual context today, so I thought that was a bit weird. But \"spunky\" was off; the book tells us that it means \"quite good looking\". Any dictionary I have ever seen defines that word quite differently.  The illustrations are not terrible, style-wise. But I really question the wisdom of that one picture. In trying to be funny, the illustrator may have inadvertently caused a whole bunch of children to need therapy.  I do not get what all the fuss is about. Maybe it works as a song, but as a picture book, it really falls short.  7 book reviews: We love donkey stories but I am afraid this one was not for us. Lots of people love this though. 8 book reviews: Oh dear. Let s make fun of disabilities for the language play. I thought we d moved on from this. 9 book reviews: I must confess I am at a loss to understand how 'The Wonky Donkey' became 'The laugh-out-loud, bestselling book that 's a viral internet sensation!' It unfortunately did very little for me and did not excite me in the least.  It has unusual illustrations and the story is simple, using snappy rhyming words to describe the donkey 's many defects, beginning with the fact that he has three legs and is thus a 'wonky donkey'.  The little bird that is following him takes up the story and at each turn adds one of the phrases to his description, for example one morning he gets up and does not have his coffee so 'cranky' is added to the descriptive list. And in the end he has eight characteristics attached to his name.  The donkey laughs all the way through, 'Hee Haw!', but sadly there were no Hee Haws for me. Perhaps read out loud to the children it might have some appeal and I imagine they might laugh at the descriptions, too.  10 book reviews: What a creepy picture book! Definitely disliked! 11 book reviews: Since this book is so popular, I decided to bring it home to read to my girls. It was clever, but I was a little grossed out by the illustrations. I did not end up reading this to my daughters because the donkey illustrations were creepy and a little crude. Reading this as an adult though, it was mildly funny. 12 book reviews: Something about the bird snatching the donkey 's eye out of his head turned me off. 13 book reviews:                       YouTube   Scottish Granny (     ,          )    ,                 ~ky         14 book reviews: Very creepy for a picture book! The donkey is called 'wonky' because he has only three legs, which is a bit insensitive. The little bird follows along behind him adding to the mixed up jumble of names, which would probably be the right pathway for a lesson on name calling if the donkey did not laugh it off through the whole book. The bird plucking the donkey 's eye out was weird and a little bit disturbing considering this is supposed to be a children 's book. I thought this would be one of those tongue twister stories to get kids laughing, but I definitely wo not be reading it to my class.  15 book reviews: Read as part of our grandma reads sessions.  The Wonky Donkey is really a song that rolls out as the pages are turned on this quick little book. I would have loved to know the tune so it could have been sung rather than read. . . .perhaps there 's a YouTube?  Music is key, and a fondness for rhythm and rhyme required.  Story makes little sense, but all littles were highly satisfied, with requests for repeat reads in future.  Hence - 3 stars, bonus for illustration of what a donkey fart looks like. . . .that got lots of laughs.  16 book reviews: This never gets old. Brilliant book that is fun to read over and over. And even funnier to give to unsuspecting relatives to read to your children. This is one of those books that is essential to all childrens book cases. 17 book reviews: Flula read this to me, that wonderful German man. 18 book reviews: This was funny 19 book reviews: This grandma reading the book is hilarious! https://www.facebook.com/boredpanda/v... 20 book reviews: Fun, ridiculous rhymes that build on one another. Parents will enjoy reading it as much as children will enjoy hearing it. It will be one of those books that years later kids will remember with great fondness. 21 book reviews: I got this because (1) I share my life with two donkeys (Willow and her son Tolstoy) and (2) this has been among the best-selling of all books on Amazon for quite a while so I figured there must be something to it since it 's not a new book. But ... meh.  I am not the intended audience so there 's that. This is intended to be read aloud to a very small child, who I am sure will laugh and snort every time \"Hee haw!\" is exclaimed. The book is written a bit like \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" where everything that goes before is repeated on each subsequent page with one phrase added. I did not find it cute and, in fact, found the increasingly long description of the donkey to be cumbersome. And it did not capture the vibe of real-life donkeys. The art was fine, but the image of the bird with the donkey 's eye in his mouth was a little creepy.  Grade: C  22 book reviews: This is a book I never would have picked up on my own, so thank you, Linda P., for sticking this on my desk. No real plot to this one, just super-silly wordplay. Great for a readaloud. Scholastic says it has a downloadable song, but I could not find it.  Nevertheless, the goofy stretched-out descriptive list (\"he was a cranky stinky-dinky lanky honky-tonky winky wonky donkey\") will get giggles. The lack of commas makes me a little nutso, but I could see using this as a springboard for a silly phonics lesson.  23 book reviews: I have always made a point of keeping it real. I had never heard about this book before a month ago. I came across it in my local Barnes & Noble. From the onset, the title grabbed my attention. I had to read it... By the third page, the giggles started. Midway through I found myself laughing hysterically. By the end, I found myself wiping away tears of laughter. I am truly looking forward to sharing this book with my students. I think they will get a kick out of it, especially when I accompany it with the music.  But, I must ask: What is the story really all about?  24 book reviews: Before purchasing this book for a child, you should know that the donkey is \"wonky\" because he has a prosthetic leg. And that 's supposed to be hilarious. Do not instill ableism in your toddlers by teaching them to laugh at this book.  There are many many other amazing picture books with funny word-play. Books that do not mock vulnerable members of society. 25 book reviews: I have tried reading this book out loud without laughing, and so far, no luck. 26 book reviews: Bizarre little 'partridge in a pear tree'-esque picture book about a very unusual and amusing donkey :D 27 book reviews: HIlarious:) A lot had to do with the delightful Scottish Granny reading to her grandson of course and having such a laugh while doing so, but made it enjoyable then! 28 book reviews: Very zany and crazy story. It does not make sense but it 's a fun memory game for kids to read or sing aloud. Parents got it for 5 year old nephew for Christmas. He tossed it aside so I am guessing the\" (prosthetic leg). Kids who are \"wonky\" themselves will get a kick out of seeing this wonky donkey. 29 book reviews: 5  Beyond cute and funny. This is the best children 's book we have read this year!  ",
    " Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man": "book reviews: Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest   In TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH, Mary L. Trump draws a detailed portrait of the Trump family pathologies with the intimacy of a psychological case study-- which makes sense, considering that she 's a clinical psychologist. Her even-keeled, neutral (for the most part) tone make the irrational behaviors of the people in this book seem even more abhorrent by comparison. The occasional sarcastic aside is just icing on the cake.    I was not too sure what to expect about TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH going in, despite the attempted block from the Trump family to keep it from being published. Trump had also attempted to block Michael Wolff and John Bolton from publishing their \"tell-alls,\" as well, and the result was that both of them became best-sellers and garnered a whole bunch of free press. Literally the same exact thing happened with Mary L. Trump 's book, but Donald Trump 's inability to admit to fault or learn from past mistakes is just one of his (many) flaws. I was left with the impression that Mary Trump was essentially opening her own \"tea\" shop to spill all the gossip about Trump, but this book does not tell anything too scandalizing or surprising. It basically fills in the gaps about things that are public knowledge but have been forgotten or pushed aside in favor of newer, more recent scandals.    The book starts out with a history of the Trump family, beginning with Fred, DT 's father, who appears to have been a high-functioning sociopath that enjoyed pitting his children against each other, reveled in the humiliations of others, despised weakness and personal accountability, and groomed Donald to be his successor, while also enabling him to be antisocial, unaccountable, and superficial by not punishing him for misbehavior and essentially providing him with a bottomless well of cash flow for all of his horrible and/or questionable business decisions. Freddy, Mary 's father, was the original successor, as the eldest child, but his personal weaknesses made him distasteful to Fred, and the inability to please or escape ended up facilitating an alcohol addiction that helped kill him.    We follow Trump through the 80s, when he began to be popular as \"the poor man 's idea of rich\" (paraphrased from Fran Lebowitz), his two previous wives, his inappropriate comments and cruelties. It 's chilling how his lack of empathy or concern towards the mounting American deaths in the COVID-19 crisis mirror his behavior towards his own family members. For example, when Freddy Trump was in the hospital for the heart attack that would end his life, Donald Trump went out to the movies instead of waiting at home with the family. When his own mother was mugged so violently that she suffered a hemorrhage, and Mary visited her every day, Trump snarked that was not it great that she had so much \"free time.\" In his own internal calculus, it seems clear that weakness and suffering are liabilities that he ca not afford in a world of superlatives where everything around him must be \"great\" or \"fantastic,\" and especially if those things are a reflection on him.    Perhaps the most heartbreaking part of this book-- apart from the obvious, which is how this country facilitated and continues to enable the abuses of power that Donald Trump wields with the carelessness of a child with a dangerous weapon-- is how badly Mary and her brother Fritz were treated by the family. Donald Trump first tried to essentially oust his whole family from his father 's will by attaching a codicil to his father 's will that would have made him sole executor. It was caught by pure luck and he and his siblings were all made executors with equal power. You would think that this would make the siblings sympathetic to being cut out of what is their due, but the whole family undervalued Mary and Fritz 's inheritance when they were cut out of the will and forced to settle for a pittance, giving them a very, very small fraction of what they should have received. And when they tried to sue for what was theirs, Maryanne, Trump 's older sister, had their health insurance revoked-- which came as a huge blow to Fritz, whose son had severe medical issues that necessitated hospital visits for frequent seizures. The lawyer suggested that if they were worried about their child not breathing, they could \"learn CPR.\" Charming.    His lack of respect for Melania and creepy behavior with Ivanka get a throwaway scene each, which is all that 's really necessary, because they are so emblematic of his usual patterns. Likewise, his pompous, inappropriate form of \"leadership\" as president is showcased in the opening scene, when he invites his relatives to the White House for a visit that ends up being both classless and disturbing. TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH is a portrait of a person who lacks empathy, shirks responsibility (but would like to take all the credit while also avoiding any blame). I think it 's pretty safe to say, objectively, that he is the worst president the United States has ever had, and that his handling of our crises and petty attempts to deny care and funding to those who oppose him while also making a concerted effort to sow dissent while attacking our nation 's most vulnerable showcase his bullying mentality and his desperate need to always feel strong by making others seem weak.    Some will probably say that Mary was too kind or too level in her biography of this man, but I think when writing books like this it 's important to strike that kind of tone. If you make someone into a cartoonish villain, it becomes too easy to write them off as a joke, and I think that was one of the biggest mistakes of the 2016 election. Nobody took Trump seriously until it was too late. He needs to be held accountable and taken to task for his bad behavior, and his policies need to be questioned, and he needs to be asked the tough questions that he fears will make him out to be the fool he is.    4 to 4.5 stars  1 book reviews: This is written well enough but there is no new information here. Most of the book focuses on Fred Trump Sr (trash) and Fred Jr, the author s dad whose story is quite sad. The whole family is very terrible! Donald is a blathering moron. The best parts are when she eviscerates him and tells us what we already know that he is the literal worst person, and the least competent man. She seems to have empathy for him. Fuck that. Lots of people have asshole fathers and they manage not to destroy the world as a coping mechanism.  Anyway. Worst family ever.  2 book reviews: Damn.  A Trump-tell-all that he 's desperately trying to block publication of?  You have my full, undivided attention.  UPDATE  Holy shit. It was good.  3 book reviews: Thumbs up? Or Thumbs down?  Isn t that a question many of us around the world have been curious about? The book was released at midnight-July 14th.... I d bet  thousands  of people ( like myself), have already finished it.  I ve got to take some personal inventory:  why did I feel an urgency? obsession? desire? to read this book today? It s easy to quickly come up with answers as to why I rushed to read it.... But perhaps it s more valuable to sit with the question longer.  Fact is.... Trump s bizarre- evil - unkind behavior and choices are sooo mind- boggling for many of us....there  still  is a sense of mystery about him... ......as in WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN? Yes...I understand we intellectually know he s ill. We intellectually know he s not going to change.... but a part of us still hope we can reason with Mr. Unreasonable. We can t....and it s maddening & frustrating.  Another question: WHAT IS WRONG with the rest of us to have allowed a mentally unstable - unqualified - dangerous - racist - mean- cheating - lying - monster-of-a-human being.....to be President of the United States of America?  YES....THIS BOOK IS WORTH READING!  Are there juicy parts? Inside family gossip and commentaries? You betcha! Some parts were very interesting.....some parts just very sad....and a few parts dull. But overall....a valuable ( short time investment), book.  Mary L. Trump s perspectives come with her professional qualifications, as a clinical psychologist, personal experiences, honest-as-one-can- be-objective points of view, and a few of her own biases. ( splitting at the seems). Not sure I can blame Mary for this...but a little resentment is noticeable.   Viva-la-la -dirty-laundry highlights...and/or excerpts:  ....Donald Trump cheated on his SAT s. ( paid someone to take them)  .... The media failed to notice that not one member of Donald s family, apart from his children, his son-in-law and his current wife, said a word in support of him during the entire campaign . WOW!! My thoughts... many of us were too nonchalant - never believing Trump would win. We thought it was a joke. Ha....the joke has been on us for the past 3.5 years....and now  nothing  is funny any longer. Our country is in need of serious help!  ....  Donald Trump s need for affirmation is so great that he doesn t seem to notice that the largest group of his supporters are condescending people who wouldn t be seen with him outside of a rally .  ....  Donald today is as capable as he was at three years old....incapable of growing, learning or revolving, able to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information .  .... Nothing is ever enough. Trump goes far beyond the garden-style-narcissism. Donald is not simply weak. His ego is a fragile thing that must be bolstered every moment because he knows deep down that he is nothing of what he claims to be. He knows he has never been loved. So he must draw you in if he can by getting you to accent even the most seemingly insignificant thing. He makes his insecurities and vulnerabilities other peoples responsibility.  .....  His bragging is not really directed at the audience in front of him...but of his audience of one.  .....  Our country is suffering from false-positivity   With literally thousands of people reading or  audiobook-listening  to this book today - (July 14th, 2020 release date)- [300 pages - or 7 hours and 5 minutes audio] ..... dozens  of reviews ( professional and mainstream reviews), can be found on the Internet already. I can t help but wonder how human-thought is shifting around the world... As a global community....what are we ( readers), really seeking from this book? I think - in actuality - we want more than the inside family scoop....but the inside insights are a great place to start. ( so thank you Mary L. Trump)  It took me a few chapters to feel  invested  fully in this book. I wondered if I was going to learn anything new about Donald Trump.... I did....but nothing was shocking....still there were eye-openers. Contextually we get the panoramic overview of three men: 1. Fred Trump: Donald s father ( a sociopathic, alcoholic,bullying, dictator of a man) > NOTE... this book feels equally about him as it does Donald Trump.  2.Fred Trump Jr: Mary L Trump s father ( lots of trials and tribulations between father and first born son)... and lots of sadness .... that spills over to Mary. Mary suffered watching her dad suffer. Fred Trump Jr. died young of a heart attack in his early forties.  3.Donald Trump > mental illness, personality disorder, social anxiety disorder, trauma related disorders, childhood years, real estate years, tax fraud details, holiday stories at Christmas and Thanksgiving, gift giving, Mary s relationship with Uncle Donald through her  growing up  recollections, etc. We are brought to date with Donald s recent handling (not handling), the tragic emergence and unfolding devastation of Covid-19. Mary explains why Donald Trump cannot - will not - is unable to show compassion and empathy.  ....We learned a little about Donald Trump s other siblings and his mother....the broken relationships. ....We learn about the education Donald had - and Mary had. ....We can see where Donald was indulged with material things....but not with moral values. ....Mary Trump s insights are undeniable. She confirms what many of us have suspected. She s a skillful writer....a good storyteller.... And.... Her message is clear: WE CAN NOT ALLOW DONALD TRUMP A SECOND TERM IN THE WHITE HOUSE....  Our country has some serious healing to do! GREAT CONTRIBUTION, Mary L. Trump! Thank you!!!  4+ moving rating up to 5 stars ....for the value this book might stimulate in the area of world community conversations.  4 book reviews: Look at that photo. He 's been doing the same stupid shit with his hair all his life. What a dork.  The current administration has engendered an entirely new category of creativity as we all struggle to find outlets for our rage and sorrow and fear of the future. I am no Randy Rainbow, but here 's my humble contribution to the new rage genre, with apologies to the lovely Miss Linda Ronstadt.  If you are not familiar with the original song and you would like to sing along, here 's the inimitable chanteuse 's version:  Feelin' ready for somethin' new, We will feel better when we are rid of you. No one loves you but Kim Jong Un, November 's comin', so you would better run.  You are no good, you are no good, you are no good, Donny, you are no good. I am gonna scream it again, You are no good, you are no good, you are no good, Donny, you are no good.  There 's just one digit in your I.Q. , Vladdy knows it and he gives you the screw. Bully Barr ca not make it to Mass, With his lips skin-grafted to your ass.  You are no good, you are no good, you are no good, Donny, you are no good. I am gonna scream it again, You are no good, you are no good, you are no good, Donny, you are no good.  I am tellin' YOU now, Donny, Wipe that smirk off your face. Moscow Mitch will ditch you when you are losin' the race.  You are no good, you are no good, you are no good, Donny, you are no good...  That 's all, folks. Perhaps the Biden team would like to adopt it as a campaign jingle. I am toying with a couple more verses, which I may add if the muse moves me. If you could see me dance while I sing this, you would know how truly disturbed I am.  Now I have had my fun, and I do have some cogent thoughts about this book. I will post them after they have had time to brew and stew and shrink to a manageable volume.  5 book reviews: Who could have predicted that a Trump presidency would lead to 200,000+ dead Americans and staggering unemployment?! Mary L. Trump and oh yeah, anyone.  I have not read one of these trendy political expos s since Fire and Fury but somehow Mary 's book enticed me. Her interviews have suggested the book might include racist rants over Thanksgiving turkey or other squabbles revealing Donald as even more villainous than how he behaves in public.  Unfortunately it 's not like that. Not at all. Donald is barely mentioned. Maybe 5% of the book at most. The rest focuses on other foul characters in the Trump family and how Mary 's side was mistreated. It 's a 200 page poor-me sob story with a few pro-Hillary lines of red meat to sell copies.  A huge chunk of the book blabbers about her lawsuit trying to a get a share of the family fortune. It 's a scene straight from \"Knives Out.\" Mary even has her lawyer argue that her grandfather 's will was invalid because he was not of \"sound mind\" when it was signed! How clich  is that?  Another disappointment is that Mary 's psychology background is rarely put to good use. She hypothesizes what might have been going on in Donald 's head at certain times and theorizes that he is still a spoiled toddler seeking his evil father 's approval. Probably true, but she does not provide enough expertise as to why she thinks that. I could make just as many good assessments about Donald 's mental instability from my armchair.  Overall, uninteresting and uninformative. I appreciate Mary 's willingness to speak out against her evil family, but this is just an attempt to separate herself from Trump baggage and cash in at the same time. The irony is that she 's portrayed nearly as annoying as they are. At this point I am done with all the Trumps. That includes you, Mary.  6 book reviews: A shocking insiders  autobiographical story of epigenetic in action, opening the question of where to go with ethics and morality if one has no chance to choose on from the beginning, with an absentminded, ill mother just interested in her own suffering and a sociopathic father Trump has become himself too.  It s vicious, the author shows how the influence of the elder generations formed a climate that was a dark caricature of what family should mean, the opposite of what someone needs to become a friendly, mind opened, and tolerant human. Ironically it s closer to what is shown on the TV, Donald Trump loves so much to watch and see himself in, than to normal family life and one simply wouldn t believe that it happened like that.  But I had the same thought before reading Bob Woodwards rage.  I just couldn t imagine that someone would deliberately, because of a desperate need for attention, openly speak about so many things that can be used against him. These interviews are a glimpse into a soul formed by a childhood dominated by fear, humiliation, alpha predatory male dominance, frigidity, psycho terror, and extreme affluence neglect.  It also popped up in Michael Cohens Disloyal  especially regarding the leadership style that could be seen as a reflection of how he and the other kids were treated when small and how he used to behave towards employes, family, spouses, and humans in general in his own company before becoming president of the once less hate filled and troll lead United States of America.  Reading these 3 books opened my mind for the thoughts and mindsets of conservatives, republicans, and ideology fueled people in general and made me just more tolerant in one regard. That they had no chance, that the same would have happened to me if I would have been born in such a family, that I could be like Trump. And that it s the ideology and model of society that is breeding modern humans for a few tens of thousands of years now, not to forget the origin before, that is mainly to blame, because many highly developed nations have intelligent and responsible leaders and would never vote that way, never let it happen that their population is so susceptible for propaganda and manipulation thanks to devastated educational systems and extremism thanks to neoliberal turbo capitalistic privatization. Thanks, Milton.  It doesn t wonder that someone who was brought up under such conditions is cold as ice, goes to the movies while Freddy Trump is dying, doesn t care about his mugged mother, tries to get all his father s money, treats his wives and women in general that way, and the hundreds of known things he did over his life. In a way, his father succeeded, because he seems to have made him exactly the unscrupulous person he wished for.  As a clinical psychologist, Mary Trump has a special look on what happened to her and her family, and reading this reminds one that one shouldn t underestimate people who grew up in sociopathic madness, to be unleashed onto the world with the trouser pockets full of unlimited money to do whatever they want without consequences, treat people like garbage, especially never get sophisticated and wise themselves, take no responsibility for their actions, be incompetent because of a disinterest in education and learning, etc.  She draws a picture of someone who never grew out of his defiant phase, is at the same time extremely unfriendly and inhuman, but craves for attention and recognition (that s extremely obvious in Woodwards Rage too), has no real control over his emotions, could be diagnosed with a load of mental problems or even real diseases, etc. and really shouldn t be in a position of power.  Hard to imagine a home without books, but even this was inherited. I had to think of Trumps proudness not to read, imagining him as a kid in a mansion without novels, well described with the quote \"A home without books is like a body without a soul.\" That s just topped by the dynamic between Fred Trump, Donald Trump s elder brother Fred Trump Jr, and the man himself. As said, one normally sees this in TV dramas, not in real life, a father that is disappointed by a normal, friendly boy like Fred and motivates and promotes any kind of negative Donald behavior. It s like breeding supervillains and punishing the social, normal kid for not being a bully and reckless egomaniac.  In this anti intellectualism could also lie the foundation of his hostility towards science, because bashing against something one doesn t know, understand, or like is much easier with complete ignorance than with at least reading a book a year or something. I kind of wonder how he reads all the important top secret and general stuff a president gets put onto his table   There is no excuse for becoming such an adult, but it gets easier to understand why and how people could become like this, when vivisecting how ideologies shape the societies they control.  Looking at different socioeconomic and cultural evolutionary steps, one can see the living consequences of different ideologies put in action, from futuristic to anachronistic with many stages in between. The Scandinavian states, Netherlands, Swiss, etc. with their  focusing on Keynesian eco social ideals, free education and health care, strong social nets in strong states, fair taxes, etc., are highest on the Human development index  followed by many other Western democracies, but the more free market, neoliberal, and weak state it gets, the worse the situation for the humans living there.  It s no wonder if, in democracies around the world that are still fueled by wacky ideologies from fringe humanities such as economics, bad pop psychology and sociology, and political sciences, people develop mentalities like Trump. If an innocent baby and small child can be formed into an adult that is disliked by so many people, something is going terribly wrong with the whole democratic system, because dozens of millions of deluded and mesmerized voters following and adoring hate speech and trolling isn t a sign of an enlightened, progressive humankind, but of a conservative, backlashing, and extremely dangerous mentality.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:      I ve added the next passage with the links to my review of Rage and Disloyal too, because it just fits perfectly, so you might have already seen it.  To be fair, I deem all, except of the Scandinavian countries, Swiss, and the Netherlands, industrial northern democracies the same messes, just with different grades of suffering and pain for the citizens. Social evolution has stagnated and lead to a dead, ridiculous democratic system, completely controlled by lobbyism, not to be taken seriously anymore, leading to a situation where comedy shows and websites such as The daily show with Trevor Noah  The onion  The late show with Stephen Colbert  etc. bring more depth, insight, and truth than all education in schools, newspapers, news networks, and, lol, the representatives themselves. If it wouldn t be so sad, destroy the planet, and harm so many innocent people, especially in the Southern hemisphere, the laughs wouldn t be that bitter.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: History of madness     Establishing the lunacy using      The lenses it will be seen with   7 book reviews: Trump redux...  ==========  Trump is obsessed with being a loser.  https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/arc...  =========  Singing the same song when he crashed a wedding last year....    ============  The first sentence of Leo Tolstoy s novel Anna Karenina is:  Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.  I would modernize the second half and say:  every dysfunctional family is dysfunctional in its own way.  And then add  and always destructive to the children.\"  My family of origin was about as dysfunctional as the Trumps, though not in the exact way. My mother, was a self-described  cold fish,  frozen by fear with PTSD, and incapable of showing affection. Her favorite writer was Ayn Rand. My father had a bad temper and excoriated his sons. And he was always pressing me to become a medical doctor like himself. The fallout for my siblings and me was severe.  My older brother, with a lifetime weight problem led a distressed, sad life, and died at age 39. My sister eloped young with a guy she barely knew, who is now dead as a result of slow suicide from heavy drinking and smoking. My younger brother, has a very Trump-like personality, a con man who stole from others. I am the only one who, at least partially, escaped, thanks to years of counseling and training at Stanford University. I don t offer these details as a plea for sympathy, but to give a sense that I know what Mary Trump is getting at with her book.  Like my parents, Donald Trump s were a very dysfunctional pair. The damage from this dysfunction washed through the extended family like a huge dark tsunami that swept everything in its wake. This includes the author, whose father Fred, Jr. was crushed by Fred, Sr. Donald survived because he opted to become like his father, what his dad called a  killer.   As Mary writes:  {Donald s} personality served his father s purpose. That s what sociopaths do: they co-opt others and use them toward their own ends   ruthlessly and efficiently, with no tolerance for dissent or resistance.   Meanwhile, his mother was an invalid who never stood up for the kids and didn t seem to love them. And his father limited Donald s access to his own feelings, rendering many of them unacceptable, thus perverting his son s perception of the world and undermining his ability to live in it.  As Alice Miller writes in her book,  The Drama of the Gifted Child    If we re lucky, we have, as infants and toddlers, at least one emotionally available parent who consistently fulfills our needs and responds to our desires for attention. Being held and comforted, having our feelings acknowledged and our upsets soothed are all critical for the healthy development of young children. This kind of attention creates a sense of safety and security that ultimately allows us to explore the world around us without excessive fear or unmanageable anxiety because we know we can count on the bedrock support of at least one caregiver.   I have followed this advice firsthand with two, now grown, children and a two-year-old granddaughter. I broke the cycle of emotional distress in my family and did almost everything differently, with happy results. (As the philosopher Simon Weil rightly observes:  Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. )  Without this attention and love, there is a tremendous insecurity in the child and a void that can never be filled. He remains needy his whole life and demands constant affirmation and admiration from those around him, and cannot take the slightest bit of criticism or dissent. I know this because it s in my own family of origin.  As Alice Miller also writes    The grandiose person is never really free; first, because he is excessively dependent on admiration from others, and second, because his self-respect is dependent on qualities, functions, and achievements that can suddenly fail.   Which is exactly what happened with my younger brother.  Desperate for attention, Donald predictably acted out at home and in school. His mother was at a loss of how to stop this and his dad didn t bother to notice. He was always terrorizing other kids and learned to evade responsibility by lying.  Trump also learned from his father that society s rules didn t apply to him, even while, as the author writes  his exaggerated display of self-worth drew some people to him, confusing his arrogance for strength, his false bravado for accomplishment, and his superficial interest in them for charisma.   Again. D j  vu.  With his father s support, Donald became a first class con man. But he lacked his father s business acumen. He was losing millions and millions of dollars on his failed casinos. As the bankruptcies and embarrassments mounted, Donald was confronted for the first time with the limits of his ability to talk or threaten his way out of a problem.  Always in search of an escape hatch, he came up with a plan to betray his father and steal vast sums of money from his siblings. There was a sense in the family that his father was becoming senile, so Trump hired a lawyer to draft a codicil (a legal supplement) for his father s will that would put Donald in complete control of Fred s estate, including the empire and all its holdings, after he died. But Fred was still alert enough to see mischief was afoot and refused to sign.  Wouldn t you love to have a sibling like that?  Like his father, Donald had all the classic sociopath traits: lack of empathy, a facility for lying, an indifference to right and wrong, abusive behavior, and a lack of interest in the rights of others. The personality traits that resulted were displays of narcissism, bullying, grandiosity.  But if things do not go his way, he plays the victim, as my brother also did when things collapsed. They are oblivious to how they are the author of their own problems. At the end of Trump 's recent interview on Fox News, when Chris Wallace asked Trump to sum up his term, he said:  I think I was very unfairly treated.   Some of his supporters, such as Steve Bannon, suggested earlier this year that Trump could experience a  Churchill Moment  by rallying the nation to combat Covid. But if we know Trump s true character, we know that could never happen. He doesn t care if people die and he has no clue how to go off his hate script and inspire people to constructive action.  Evangelicals and the alt-right see Donald Trump as some kind of savior who will restore the U.S. to its supposed white, Christian glory. Some believe the hand of God is on him. This is why they let slide all of his malfeasance and nasty behavior. But we are seeing more and more that he is mentally unstable.  But if you have a sociopathic leader that people adore, and followers who have no use for democracy, let us ponder what kind of historical situation that reminds us of, shall we?  ==========================  Trump has NEVER been a financial success, in spite of his claims to be a billionaire. He squandered the $400 million plus dollars his father gave to him. He had no idea how to run a business. Many people do not seem to understand that The Apprentice was just play-acting. He 's trying to make up for that now by using his current position as an opportunity for kleptomania.  This is the man Republicans chose because of his business smarts and success?    ================  Mary Trump s Favorite Parts of Uncle Donald s $100 Million Lawsuit  Mary says  I had no idea  until The Daily Beast called her on Tuesday night that her uncle is suing her for $100 million and she told him that he s  a fucking loser.   And now that she s read the suit, she says one of her  favorite things  in there is the part about how  somehow these New York Times reporters coerced me. Like, there s a difference between convincing someone over time and coercing them but apparently I m such a weak child that they were able to strong-arm me into smuggling my own documents and handing them over.   But, Mary says,  probably my favorite thing about the suit is that he quotes the Times article extensively, which outlines all the awful things Donald had done. And then he quotes extensively from my book. Thank you! Should I be angry, or should I send him flowers for selling more books for me? I think it s the latter. Donald and Meghan McCain are like my best salespeople.   As to discovery in her uncle s suit,  it s never going to come to that,  predicted Mary.  As my attorney Ted Boutrous, who s handling the First Amendment stuff, said, it s dead in the water. It s doomed to fail because it s so shoddy. How did I damage him? Even if you can argue there was a contractual breach, which there isn t, what damage did I do to him? What, do I give him, a buck?    I don t think he has lawyers left at this point who probably do anything other than operate out of strip malls. But he s probably worried about my lawsuit against him, because this is how the Trump family communicates: We sue each other,  continued Mary, who predicted that  there will be discovery  in her ongoing fraud suit against Donald and his siblings because  it 's an incredibly well-crafted suit, there s a lot of merit, and I m not backing down I m not settling.   8 book reviews: As my father lay dying, Donald went to the movies. If he can in any way profit from your death, he ll facilitate it, and then he ll ignore the fact that you died. So, you think your family s nuts?  Usually we have to wait for historians to delve back through the years of a president s life, digging through letters and writings, interviewing any who might have interacted with them, checking their letters and writings, to cull relevant bits, suss out impactful events, discern motivations and understand how that president came to make the decisions he (still only he) made. Also, sift fact from spin or worse in former presidents  memoirs and other writings   - image from Inside Edition  It is quite likely that Donald Trump may be the most written about person, let alone politician, in modern American history. And despite his attempts, many of them, sadly, all too successful, to protect his information from the world, (still waiting on those tax returns) there are so many eyes looking his way, so many searchlights in the darkness, that details continue to emerge, daily, it seems. But there are few who have the sort of access available to a family member. Reporters and historians did not have the personal experiences of dealing with him in a household setting. His remaining siblings have their own reasons to keep their counsel, despite the odd secretly-taped statement that finds its way to the public arena. But we have something pretty close, if a generation removed. Not a sibling, but Donald s niece, Mary Trump, daughter of the eldest of Fred Trump s children, Freddy. She is not only a family member but a clinical psychologist to boot. While she was not present when Donald was a child, (he was 19 when she was born) she was as familiar as one could be with family who had been, and had personal exposure to him all her life, in addition to the many tales she heard from family members of Donald s earlier days.  The stories she tells paint a picture of how Donald came to be the person he is. She does not offer a hard diagnosis on how much might be genetic and how much nurture, but the implication is clear that it was a substantial mix of both. There are better sources for the details of Donald s lifelong crime spree. What Mary Trump offers is a look into the poisoned tree from which this rotten apple dropped. One thing that stands out is that, even though Fred Sr encouraged all Donald s worst qualities, there is rarely any sense that Donald any positive ones beyond a superficial charm. In the Stephanopoulos interview, though, Mary talks about there having once been some kind inclinations in Donald, but they were squashed by his father. Even as a child, he delighted in bullying children smaller than himself, to the extent that Fred was to take him out of a school on whose board Fred sat. That must have been a fun conversation. Pop relocated Donald to the New York Military Academy, six miles north of West Point, in upstate New York. It was the equivalent of being sent to reform school for rich kids.  A lot of the book focuses on Mary s father, Freddy, the oldest of the siblings, the one expected to take over the business. He presumed he would be the head of his father s company, but Pop never really gave him a chance, sticking him with relatively menial work. He was a kid who was kind, had friends, and interests other than his father s business. This got him labeled as weak and a failure. Fred Senior preferred someone with what he considered a  killer  instinct, which translated into being as sociopathic as he was. He offered zero support for Freddy s interest in flying, even though he had joined the United States Air Force ROTC in college and put in mad hours flying and training. Even after he secured a choice position as a pilot with TWA, the elite airline of the stars, flying their new 707 from Boston to Los Angeles, a pretty big deal at the time, his father regarded him as nothing more than a bus driver in the sky. But even after abandoning his flying career, and crawling back to his father, Fred Sr. never really gave him a chance at gaining any real authority. Donald, the second son, eight years younger, was more than happy to step into the favorite son shoes. He clearly had the temperament, the narcissism and malignant regard for others that his father so wanted to see in a successor.  Mary offers some details on the business disasters that Donald wrought, his business talent pretty much as non-existent as his talent for dishonesty and self-promotion was vast. Even Mary bought into the spin for a long time, not realizing that Fred Sr. had been keeping Donald afloat with hundreds of millions in loans and often illegal gifts. It was when Donald asked her to ghostwrite one of his books that she did some actual research into him, followed him around, and realized just what a totally empty suit he truly was.  There are plenty of quotes from this book making the rounds, a passel of stories. I will spare you the full list. But there are few things worth noting. ----------Donald s disregard for women tracks with his father s disregard for wife, and even Donald s dismissive treatment of her. ----------Donald even tried to steal his siblings  inheritance, a ploy that was only sidetracked because Fred Sr was having a rare lucid day and smelled a rat, when his lawyer, whom Donald had recruited for this will-rewrite task, asked him to sign some papers. It was Donald s mother who saw to it that the plot was foiled. ----------It is telling to see how Donald has recreated in his role as president the model set by his father for always keeping his children from any feeling of security. ----------He has inherited pop s complete incapacity and/or unwillingness to accept any responsibility for his actions. But at some point you become responsible for yourself, and it is clear that whether he has the capacity or not, Donald never will. He will remain a spoiled child, a bully, a danger to anyone near him, and now, as someone with the instruments of national power at his disposal, an actual menace to the planet.  One of the overarching feelings I had while reading this book was sadness. However awful Donald is today (and has been almost all his life), it is still a very sad thing for anyone to grow up in a household where a father s love was not only unavailable, but in which even wanting such affection would be considered a sign of weakness, and cause for rejection and humiliation. Add to this a mother whose narcissism combined with physical illness to ensure that their interactions would be all about her, and never about him. Mary s relationship with her grandmother, Donald s mother, is also heart-breaking.  Materials from the book are all over the print and digital media. The understandable focus there is on the actual content of the book. What happened, where, and when, what was said, by whom? How did Donald become so awful and what awful things has he done or said that we do not yet know about? Usually unmentioned, or maybe noted in passing, is what a bloody good read this book is. I found myself rapt while poring through it, and not just fascinated by the major multi-car pileup that is Donald s life, but actually moved, particularly by the other main story Mary tells, that of her father s demise. What a waste of a life, of an opportunity, and at the hands of madness.  Trumps are not known for writing their own books. But Mary had an interest rarely, if ever, seen in the Trump family. While Mary Trump does not have the objectivity of a true outsider looking at the family, that does not mean that she leaves her clinical toolbox unopened. She has a PhD in clinical psychology. She has observed and had reliable reports on a large swath of Donald s life, and the lives of other family members, a solid grounding for offering a very well-informed, and analytically incisive, opinion about Donald and other family members.  Her personal take on 45 is the best we are likely to ever have in terms of understanding the psychological roots and early journey into madness of our Psycho President. It is a frightening picture. We can only hope that we all get to live long enough to fully appreciate just how valuable it is.

Why read another Trump book?  I swore I was done with books about the Trump regime until they can be written with the long lens of 20 years  hindsight.  But this is by a family member (DJT s niece) with a PhD in clinical psychology. Clearly she s not impartial (she blames her grandfather and uncle for her father s psychological problems, alcoholism and early death, contested her grandfather s will, and voted for Hillary Clinton), but she applies professional analysis to private family knowledge in a unique way.       It s personal, readable, short, and thoughtful. Occasionally self-justifying. There s anger and resentment, but it wouldn t ring true without, and she stops short of self-pity.  Mary recounts incidents, then applies a psychological lens, without clinical jargon. Rather than diagnose, she shows how damaged parents raised even more damaged children. It s far worse than Philip Larkin s brilliant that famously opens,  They fuck you up, your mum and dad .  Donald s mother was very ill, and largely absent, when he was a toddler, and never fully recovered:  . His father was a manipulative sociopath with many of the behaviours that are so evident in his son today.      : (.)  The title is not primarily about money:     Others have noted how Donald taps into MAGA voters  fears:    This conjures a degree of sympathy for Donald 's abusive upbringing - ironic, given his own inability to empathise. Mary is excusing him, but she explaining him.  The other connected theme is enablers: family, banks, media - and now most of the GOP. The pain and cruelty applied across the family now have full rein across the country.   (darlenelancer.com)  Fortunately, it s also sharply funny at times, especially put-downs of Pence, Jared and Ivanka, and Charles Kushner, and the ludicrously inappropriate items Donald and Ivana regifted.    Like other chart-topping Trump-related books, there are no big surprises: it confirms what I ve long observed, read, and inferred. But the examples and reasons are new and revealing.  The focus reflects the fact it s an analysis of a dysfunctional family. There s quite a lot about property deals because it was the battleground between Fred, Freddy, and Donald. Similarly, trusts, tax, and wills, because  . Conversely, there s almost nothing about Putin/Russia or the Apprentice..   : (.)  is barely discussed. The Access Hollywood tape is noted only because the GOP didn t waver, and the many women who ve accused him of sexual assault or rape aren t mentioned, nor Stormy Daniels. There are few incidents of Donald 's inappropriate lechery, but his many creepily sexual comments about Ivanka merit a single mention:  \"\"  Surely a psychologist, unpicking unhealthy family dynamics, should have more to say?       This book won t change anyone s mind. Even if it could, it 's 5 years too late. But it 's clearly a rushed job: no TOC, chronology sometimes jumps unnecessarily, and some chapters are broken into very small chunks, while others are not. Covid-19 was the final straw.     A secondary motive is to understand and exonerate her father, Freddy - the only one of Fred s five children to accomplish anything entirely by his own efforts (becoming a TWA pilot,  ). The tragedy is that that s what doomed him.    Worse:     : (.)       Mary says if money was her motive, she d have published years ago, when it was less risky. That may be true, especially as one of the most startling revelations was how massively she underestimated the family s vast wealth until, in 2018, she helped the NYT research  . And she wasn t the only one: the  , Freddy mostly lived in relative poverty, and only Donald was rich and extravagant.  The family s occasional church was  s. He wrote , a precursor to , which implied Fred   and  . Consequently  .     The library, a room without books until Donald s ghostwritten The Art of the Deal was published in 1987.   This was published only days ago, but all the best/worst bits are widely quoted online.       Donald was to my grandfather what the border wall has been for Donald: a vanity project funded at the expense of more worthy pursuits.      Although frugal, Fred was neither modest nor humble. He had had a propensity for showmanship, and he often trafficked in hyperbole everything was  great,   fantastic,  and  perfect.      For some of the Trump kids, lying was a way of life, and for Fred s oldest son, lying was defensive. For Donald, lying was primarily a mode of self-aggrandizement.      He had a streak of superficial charm, even charisma, that sucked certain people in. When his ability to charm hit a wall, he deployed another  business strategy : throwing tantrums during which he threatened to bankrupt or otherwise ruin anybody who failed to let him have what he wanted. Either way, he won.      Everyone in my family experienced a strange combination of privilege and neglect. Although I had all of the material things I needed and luxuries such as private schools and summer camp there was a purposely built-in idea of uncertainty that any of it would last.      Claim that a failure is a tremendous victory, and the shameless grandiosity will retroactively make it so.     At Fred s funeral  The emphasis was on my grandfather s material success, his  killer  instinct, and his talent for saving a buck. Donald was the only one to deviate from the script  His eulogy devolved into a paean to his own greatness.      Taking away our [medical] insurance didn t benefit them at all; it was merely a way to cause us more pain and make us more desperate.      The country is now suffering from the same toxic positivity that my grandfather deployed specifically to drown out his ailing wife, torment his dying son, and damage past healing the psyche of his favorite child, Donald J Trump.      Freddy kept trying and failing to do the right thing; Donald began to realize that there was nothing he could do wrong, so he stopped trying to do anything  right. ... Fred liked his killer attitude, even if it manifested as bad behavior.      Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and Mitch McConnell... bear more than a passing psychological resemblance to Fred.        Donald s aberrant behavior has been consistently normalized by others.      In the 1980s, New York journalists and gossip columnists discovered that Donald couldn t distinguish between mockery and flattery.      But that was how it started with his misuse of language and the media s failure to ask pointed questions.      The media failed to notice that not one member of Donald s family, apart from his children, his son-in-law, and his current wife said a word in support of him during the entire campaign.      The media were more than happy to go along without question, and the banks followed suit.      It seemed as if the sheer volume of purchases, the price tags of the acquisitions, and the audacity of the transactions kept everybody, including the banks, from paying attention to his fast accumulating debt and questionable business acumen.      The banks admonished him for betraying their agreement, but they never took any action against him, which just reinforced his belief that he could do whatever he wanted.      He is, in the West Wing, essentially institutionalized.      Donald s chiefs of staff are prime examples  First they remain silent no matter what outrages are committed; then they make themselves complicit by not acting. Ultimately, they find they are expendable when Donald needs a scapegoat.      The news networks refuse to pull away. The few journalists who do challenge him, and even those who simply ask Donald for words of comfort for a terrified nation, are derided and dismissed as  nasty.      When Donald became a serious contender for the Republican Party nomination  the national media treated his pathologies  as well as his racism and misogyny, as if they were entertaining idiosyncrasies beneath which lurked maturity and seriousness of purpose  The vast bulk of the Republican Party  either embraced him or, in order to use his weakness and malleability to their own advantage, looked the other way.        Mike Pence continued to lurk on the other side of the room with a half-dead smile on his face, like the chaperone everybody wanted to avoid.      Halfway through the [aunts  birthday] meal, Jared walked into the dining room.  Oh, look,  Ivanka said, clapping her hands,  Jared s back from his trip to the Middle East,  as if we hadn t just seen him in the Oval Office. He walked over to his wife, gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, then bent over Donald  They spoke quietly for a couple of minutes. And then Jared left. He didn t acknowledge anybody else, not even my aunts  Donny leapt out of his chair and bounded after him like an excited puppy.      Lara, there,  he said.  I barely even knew who the fuck she was, honestly, but then she gave a great speech during the campaign in Georgia supporting me.  By then, Lara and Eric had been together for almost eight years.      When Freddy, at fourteen, dumped a bowl of mashed potatoes on his then-seven-year-old brother s head, it wounded Donald s pride so deeply that he d still be bothered by it when Maryanne brought it up in her toast at the White House birthday dinner in 2017.      Jared s father  released from prison three years earlier, rose to tell us that when Jared had first introduced him to Ivanka, he had thought she would never be good enough to join his family  Charles had been convicted of hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, taping their illicit encounter, and then sending the recording to his sister at his nephew s engagement party, I found his condescension a bit out of line.    : (Calvin and Hobbes, by Bill Watterson)      Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, .

A Ladybird Book About Donald Trump (satire in style of Janet and John), .  10 book reviews: Summary (Throwback Review) This is a book written by Mary L. Trump about her family. She ventilates the life of her grandfather Fred Trump Sr., her father, Fred Trump Jr., and Donald Trump and other members of her family. She chronicles how the family succeeded in the real estate business and how Donald Trump took over the family business and how he became the American President and what was the family members response to it and do they consider his Presidential stint with revere or with ignominy       Is this book simply hate speech aimed to languish Donald Trump and bring him down from the USA Presidency. Numerous Pandits considered this book as the right book released at the right time when America was going into the election. But, I have a different opinion about this book. If you consider this book from the sole angle of the extremely competitive business of book publishing or American politics, we will have to agree with the above Pandits. But this book is much more than that. I think this book was marketed wrongly, right from the title and the front cover (if we consider the emotional aspect more than the business aspect).  This book tells the tragic life story of Fred Trmp Jr. (this book 's author, Mary L. Trump s father). He seems to be such a great guy who followed his passion for becoming a Pilot, which ultimately led to his father 's wrath as he considered Pilot as a This ultimately led him to lose all his family inheritance and died at 42 in 1981. It was challenging for me to find much about him from the internet. There are very few photos of him on the internet or any media, unlike the other Trump 's. The tragic life story, his alcoholic addiction, his continued unsuccessful attempts to show his worth to his father are all heartbreaking to read.   Being a Psychologist herself and knowing Donald Trump so closely, Mary was the best person and had an extraordinary chance to explore his Psychology. Unfortunately, she even didn t try to explore that aspect. The only psychological factors discussed were a couple of paragraphs where she mentioned narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy, dependent personality disorder, and undiagnosed learning disability. I can clearly say that she missed a golden opportunity to discuss it assiduously here.     Mary successfully shows us how a troublesome childhood can scar a person 's life through both her father and her uncle 's lives.   The author shows us how some tips and tricks were implemented by the Trumps, which Mary describes they learned from Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale. We can see it clearly in multiple parts of this book. She vividly shows us that Trumps have a penchant for self-help and how it has the power to make or break an individual here.                                                             These are the questions I expected to be answered in this book regarding Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Mary was unable to address even half of these questions. Even those questions she tried to discuss were dealt in an ostensible and superficial manner instead of diving deep into it. I can t blame her too, as she should be assiduous when she was writing about her own family, especially if one of them was the American President.    Only history will tell whether Donald Trump was a charlatan and whether his period was clandestine and chagrin in the USA 's history. But many people liked his methods, and a lot more disliked it, which was reflected in the recent US elections. I believe that this book should have been written by Mary about her father, Fred Trump Jr, right from its title and book cover to the majority of discussions and mention the life of Donald Trump as another family member. There are a lot of books out there discussing the life of Donald Trump. But there is nothing out there in public discussing the life of Fred Trump Jr apart from his short stint as a pilot and his alcoholism. Mary was the ideal person to write about her father. Unfortunately, Mary was neither able to discuss much about her father nor about her Uncle Donald Trump, especially from a psychological aspect. This book doesn t contain much about Donald Trump apart from what we already knew from the media. Still, there are some real heart touching family moments in this book that have the propensity to bring tears to your eyes.  11 book reviews: One of my favorite horror novels of 2020. 12 book reviews: How do you nurture a sociopath?  If you were not aware, this book is written by Donald Trump 's niece Mary. It is a VERY short book, but it is very good.  So let 's break down a little bit about what this book is exactly. You are not going to find any state secrets here. For anyone asking \"Why Did not Mary speak out earlier\", this is addresses, but this is is not a political expose. At it 's heart, Too Much and Never Enough is a story about an extremely twisted family, that is much about the other Trumps as it is Donald.  Nothing in this book would sway a true believer. Nothing here is going to rock the world of an undecided voter- because this is a book about who the Trumps are as people. We have already seen Trump mock women, non white folks, disabled people. We have seen him do so many evil things. If you do not know who Trump is by now, I do not really know what to say about you. Too Much and Never Enough is this woman 's catharsis- its a way for her to release her trauma. Her book chronicles essentially, how she was became disenchanted with her family before 45 ever decided to run for office, how she was disinherited, and where Fred Trump comes into play as a lynchpin at the center of it all.  Mary 's father, Fred Trump junior, was an outlier. Not necessary a good man, but a complicated one who had made a number of visible mistakes before she was even born. She describes his dark relationship with his brother, and her father 's slow physical and mental decline as he falls out of favor with Fred Senior. Much of this book is really told through her father 's eyes, and through the stories he told her before his passing.  Mary 's grandfather Fred is also hi lighted as an abuser that gaslit and traumatized his children, saw the evil in his own younger son, and then raised him as an ideal son to take on the family name. Fred Senior 's cruelty towards everyone around him, and shady business practices help shaped the monster we now know today as 45.  As for Donald Trump- Mary uses a number of personal and family stories to paint a picture of Trump 's youth. Trump 's behavior does not come out of thin air, and Mary is really able to paint a picture of 45 at his darkest, which started at a much earlier age than some may expect. These personal stories are chilling and callous- often reflecting his relationships with the American people during his four years as president.  You get some interesting little tidbits about \"modern\" behavior from the family as well, from small squabbles to election night anecdotes. Imagine the literary families of Long days Journey Into the Night or Haunting of Hill House. The Trump family in Mary 's book is almost laughably literary \"broken wealthy\".  I highly recommend Too Much and Never Enough, even if you do not find yourself often drawn towards non fiction- if only because this is a simple and easy to follow biography that helps us understand how we got where we are now. How Donald Trump, against all odds, rose in the ranks of his own family from a younger \"second son\", and ended up making all of us pay for his neurosis.  I think most folks would go into this worried that Mary is providing excuses or sympathy for her family, and I can assure you that is not the case. Mary is an exceptional author and intelligent woman who makes no excuses for her family, and manages to tell a hard and painful story with striking objectivity and honesty.  13 book reviews: I ve been reluctant to read books about Donald Trump because I didn t think I d learn anything beyond what I already know. But, I don t know a lot about the Trump family, where he came from. I remember watching The Apprentice years ago, trying to figure out who this guy was because when I lived in Manhattan, he wasn t a force in the true business community (my professional backyard). It didn t take long for me to figure out from the show that something was missing from the business acumen. For me, Mary Trump fills in the missing pieces.  Ms. Trump tells the story with precision to complete a psychological profile that finally makes sense. She fills in the blanks where I finally understand his behaviors. A close friend of mine researched Fred Trump, Sr. and has pleaded with me to read his history. I didn t dismiss his request, just filed it with all of the other stuff I thought I already knew enough about. Well, my friend should feel validated right now because to understand Donald, you to know his father. He was completely shaped by this man, his creation on every level. That s not a compliment as it would be if the same was said about me and my own father.  I m really glad I opted for the audio version as Ms. Trump narrates her own story exceptionally well. In addition to the family dynamics, she provides an astonishing chronicle of exactly how they structured the family business and distribution of Fred s estate to swindle the state and federal governments. This is more than sour grapes about what Ms. Trump did or didn t receive. It s a comprehensive forensic analysis of the financial transactions and structuring. My background in accounting didn t hurt but it wasn t necessary to understand what they did.  In summary, I believe this is necessary reading, no matter your political persuasion or thoughts about Ms. Trump. It is telling that, to date, no one from the Trump family has disputed the facts of the book and I now understand why they took extreme measures to block its printing and distribution. It will give you background to decide for yourself the measure of Donald Trump from someone who was there on the inside.    (Thanks to Simon & Schuster Audio for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)  14 book reviews: First and foremost, this book is *NOT* a takedown of 45. It is *NOT* a cash-grab by an angry, estranged niece whose greed was stoked by envy.  It is the story of Fred Trump 's family from the viewpoint of someone who, despite not being welcomed within it because her father needed to be himself, still was there inside the bunker until her father 's death.  It is the memory of a person whose entire life was formed by bad parents, her own and theirs. It is the analytical conclusions of a trained psychologist whose degree is from a highly regarded school. It is also chilling, infuriating, and deeply, deeply saddening to read.  Freddy Trump never got a break; he died before his life developed meaning and long after he stopped caring about it. Fred, father of the Devil 's Brood, was a tyrannical, withholding man without a shred of empathy or emotional capacity. Mary Anne Trump, illegal Scottish immigrant, was useless and indifferent as a mother or grandmother.  And there is no doubt that 45 was formed in this nuclear reactor to be exactly who he is. Mary Trump had a balcony seat to the process and tells us exactly what happened on the occasions she was present. This is not sensationalized or presented as a bid for pity. Dr. Trump made a concerted effort to tell us what happened *then* contextualize it on a psychological level.  I did not want to read another hatchet job on 45. Of course I despise him. I do not need more fuel for that binfire. I do, however, need to have some context, some sense of *why* this catastrophe is unfolding. Dr. Mary Trump told me what I wanted to know.  The seeds of the present are always in the past.  15 book reviews: review still to come, Trump, of your \"stacked\" niece 's book -- 10/12/20: Breaking news! Review will not come. I am so tired of The Mask of the Orange Death I ca not bear to review this terrific book. Full of inside family background and useful info on the sleazebuckets. Glad I read it. That is all.  16 book reviews: Too close and not close enough  This book won t tell you much that you didn t already know about the current U.S. president his personality, his psychological makeup the man s not exactly a closed book.  But that s not this book s purpose. The author isn t concerned so much with the  what  as the  why and how . As a psychologist she naturally places the locus of this question with Donald s family, upbringing and formative years.  Finding the answers is tricky you need someone who 1) has access to the family s intimate moments, but 2) also has enough distance to put them in proper perspective. Donald s surviving siblings would be best placed to meet the first criteria but, having spent their whole lives swimming in the same toxic water, would probably fail the second. As the insider-outsider niece, Mary L. Trump had a decent shot at being the ideal observer, but as it turns out she s just not able to meet either one of these hurdles (except for one meaningful occasion).  Not being part of the inner sanctum, the author relies heavily on recollections from her aunt, Maryanne Trump Barry, and this rather hampers her ability to analyse the family dynamics in any depth. It s a fairly shallow portrayal of a family where  wealth = success  and success is the sole measure of a person s worth. While she acknowledges the coldness and cruelty this toxic value system spawned, and how it created the man for whom  everything is transactional , the author doesn t really ask where these values come from, or about the wider culture that fosters them. She objects to Donald s  success  being essentially faked but doesn t seem aware (or sufficiently interested in?) the deleterious psychological effects of massive wealth in and of itself.  For one dramatic moment in the book though, she the ideal observer the death of her father, Donald s older brother Fred Jr. This is one instance where Mary L. Trump was both present and central to events. At 16, she was old enough and independent-minded enough to recognise the family s callousness for exactly what it was. And the event was shattering enough that her vivid memories of it are credible. It s heartbreaking stuff. In a move emblematic of the man he is now, devoid of compassion and easily bored: while waiting for news of his big brother s death, Donald went to the movies.  17 book reviews: My family was not rich, but it was every bit as stark, raving wacko as the Trumps. For that reason, I found myself identifying to a point that was nearly unbearable with much that was in this book. Mary Trump is a shrink and a teacher, and although this book could have used one more editing pass, her psychological light illuminating this level of \"crazy\" is something everybody from a dysfunctional family might benefit from reading.  If you are only interested in understanding the president, you are missing what 's here. This is \"Dysfunctional Family Deconstructed 101.\"  If you have experienced being humiliated by abusive authority figures who were aroused by their ability to inflict pain, read it. If you come from drunkenness and/or addiction, read it. If you have family members with compulsive debting problems and limitless sense of entitlement, who lie the way others breathe, read it. If you have sat in the middle of absolute insanity with everybody around you acting as if it was normal, read it. And if you have ever been essentially erased after you confronted the insanity and abuse with truth, for goodness sake, read this book.  Oh, I could go on and on.  When I was about 10 and my sister was 13, we stood at our front door as extended family were about to swarm us. My sister and I were not close, but in that moment when I looked up at her and whispered, \"Good luck,\" and she repeated it back, we were as close as we would ever get both of us knowing the trauma we were about to experience without any place to run. If this resonates for you, read this book.  I have been very proud that I have worked on my own \"stuff,\" live a responsible life, and have no more day-to-day contact with the kind of insanity that I grew up with. Many of the major players are dead, and those who remain alive are estranged. Disconnection really is the only way to deal with people who are that crazy. Anything else is enabling them and/or willfully playing the role of victim. I have felt good that I have known when to call it quits. However the election of Donald Trump has not only brought back all of the old pathologies, but it has turned my country into the family I am happy to have lived through and left behind.  Mary Trump is a good shrink. She knows there is no way to change her uncle and she gives no advice for how to deal with him. The answer is you ca not. What you can do is vote him and his enablers out. I am grateful to her for her effort in that direction.   Many people are floored by Trump 's \"It is what it is\" response to the 1,000 Covid deaths a day comment in the currently viral . His disconnect from people 's loss and pain is apparent. Someone else could come to the same conclusion that life and death \"are what they are,\" but most empathic people would do so after experiencing inexorable loss and understanding that there are some things which you simply must go through.  One of the things Mary Trump does so clarifyingly well in the beginning of her book is to empathically convey the loss Trump himself went through when he was a very young child and how, never having recovered from that, he locked into a defense of never feeling anything. That is what we are now witnessing. It is horrific when you have a relative dying alone in an ICU or you have lost most of your family and everyone around you is sick or dying because of the lack of a well-executed national policy about something so simple as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand washing. But it is to be expected with somebody this damaged at the head of the government. He was trained at his father 's knee.  18 book reviews: The Title Says It All  Mary Trump comes across in the book and on television as decent, forthright and thoughtful. She did not undertake the task of writing about her uncle lightly, as she says in the book, \"He destroyed my family, I did not want him to destroy my country too.\" The man that she knows intimately is the same man we have seen daily on our screens, brutal, uncaring, crude, and grasping. He was taught these skills by a father who was the same. I do not feel sorry for him. Mary Trump explains his metamorphosis from a little child to the malignant narcissist he is today. I feel sorry for us, we the people, those who voted for him and those who did not. Both groups, we have been taken in and spit out, because Donald Trump had a cruel father and an absent mother. Most of us if we are lucky have at least one parent who nurtured us. Our ex-president did not.  19 book reviews: I have decided to embark on a mission to read a number of books on subjects that will be of great importance to the upcoming 2020 US Presidential Election. Many of these will focus on actors intricately involved in the process, in hopes that I can understand them better and, perhaps, educate others with the power to cast a ballot. I am, as always, open to serious recommendations from anyone who has a book I might like to include in the process.  This is Book #13 in my 2020 US Election Preparation Challenge.  Lucky enough to have selected this book at this point during the reading challenge, I can explore an insider s look at President Trump, penned by one who has kept a low profile. Mary L. Trump, niece to The Donald, provides readers with a look at the man that will surprise few, while offering some insights into how he became the crooked businessman whose deceit and empty lies paved the way to an unlikely victory in 2016. Full of stories that provide a family history many would want collecting dust in the attic, Mary is forthright and honest, offering readers that gift.  Donald Trump did not acquire his business sense and ruthlessness in a vacuum, at least in the eyes of his niece. Mary L. Trump, a clinical psychologist, has a story to tell, not only about Donald, but the entire Trump family. This familial examination sheds light on the patriarch, Fred, and his children. This includes the aforementioned Donald, but also Mary s own father, Freddie. The reader can see throughout the narrative just how Fred treated those who crossed him, instilling in his second son the business acumen to kick a man when he s down and insult his way through those who stand in his way. The observant reader will see how this works today, as Trump runs his White House like a family reunion, belittling anyone who is not sycophantic enough.  A detailed family history provides the reader with the needed backstory before focussing on some of the key events in Fred Trump s life. His children feared more than idolised him, including the eldest son, Freddie. After trying to branch out on his own, Freddie s vices got the better of him and he ended up losing much of what he had left, including both a position within the Trump Empire and his own family. As Mary discusses, Freddie s alcoholism left her feeling abandoned while she watched her grandfather and uncle (Fred and Donald, respectively) scheme and make their money, yet never have anything to show for it.  The middle portion of the book looks more at Uncle Donald and his start to being a businessman in his own right, dating back to the 1970s. Fred had instilled in his son all the deceitful tricks he could, while making sure to create a persona that would make everyone take notice. Mary discusses her father s final hospitalization, which led to his death, contrasting how the family handled in against the reactions of the Trump businessmen. Fred and Donald appeared put out by having to express emotion over it all, choosing to turn to the recent birth of Ivanka as a  new cycle  worth celebrating. Peppered amongst much of the rest of the book is a list of the various Donald Trump acquisitions and ill-timed downfalls that cost the businessman millions. Fred was caught numerous times trying to bail his son out through illegal donations, but the failures seemed only to create a need for more by Donald, with similar fiery crashes. These were part of the Donald Trump narrative, though hidden from any public discussion, as he published books to promote his brand. Mary played an early role in the third book, with her university background, but was fired when she could not sensationalise enough of her uncle s exploits.  Mary Trump uses the latter portion of the book to step back and look at her uncle through the eyes of a psychologist, particularly during his time in the White House (up to publication of the book). She offers some wonderful parallels between Donald and Fred, drawing not only on the history she presented in the earlier portion of the book, but decisions as president, not forgetting to add her own barbed criticism. With the treatment of her own father by two family narcissists, Mary Trump seeks to salvage her father s name, as well as that of the Trumps who do not bow to Donald, in hopes that the public will not equate everyone as part of the sycophantic flock.  Many would say that this book was an attempt by Mary L. Trump to make money off the back of her family name and insider knowledge. This would not be a lie, though not for the ways one might think at first glance. After Fred cut out Freddie s family from much of anything, Mary and her brother fought the rest of them to the end, seeking only to ensure fairness, since the maniacal businessman (Fred) was dead and could not protest. This is a look behind many of the curtains and under the proverbial beds to share tales about growing up in the shadows of Fred and Donald Trump. Some criticise it for being without anything that was not known before, which is again misconstrued by the impatient reader. That Mary Trump can replicate many of the stories that people know goes to substantiate their truths, rather than being piled up as fake or misunderstood. There is no doubt that Donald acquired his father s tendencies when it comes to business and treating others, which does not bode well for anyone hoping that he will soften with age. His misogyny was strong throughout, as was the entitlement, according to Mary. With decent writing and some interesting family vignettes, the narrative moved along well, though there was an obvious pall to the book when discussing the poor treatment of Freddie and his struggle with addiction. More of a backgrounder primer for my challenge, this book substantiates some things and can serve to educate the reader as to just how clueless Donald was about social and financial situations, which leaves many to wonder what happens if Donald develops Fred s dementia. Will jars of jellybeans or Starbursts appear in every room? God help us all!  Kudos, Madam Trump, for having the courage to share, knowing that some will tar and feather you for it. Real news shines through, even if rally-goers drink too much Kool-Aid already.  Love/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:   A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge:  20 book reviews: 'We need to talk about the elephant in the room.'  I was reading this book while watching the Netflix docu series Trump: An American Dream. In the fourth and final episode entitled  Politics , it is suggested that Obama s roasting of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents  Dinner was the final trigger to make the Donald run for office, as this was the sort of humiliation and embarrassment that he could neither forget nor forgive.  Up to that point, Trump had been rather coy about his presidential ambitions. It is also notable that Trump first used the slogan  Make America Great Again  on 7 Nov 2012, the day after Obama won against Romney. So was Obama inadvertently responsible for priming America s greatest nemesis, akin to a superhero origin story where the good guy inadvertently gives rise to evil?  The great value of Mary Trump s book is, indeed, the light it shines on Trump s own origin story   not in the sense of his personal mythopoiesis, but in the broader sense of his family relations and personal life.  All the facts here are overly familiar to anyone with a passing interest in Trump, and these do read like filler sections of the book. The writing only really sparks or presents a real sense of urgency when his niece presents her psychological insights into her uncle s behaviour   and what a withering gaze it is.  You can sense the anger simmering beneath the surface of the page, but it is a coolly controlled rage only allowed expression in a current of black humour and acerbic wit that runs throughout like a pulsing vein.  I honestly wish Mary Trump had been allowed more time to flesh out the book, and also to give us more insight into her own character and role in the family. Surely she is as much an  enabler  as everyone else she slags off, especially as she is only  coming out  now, as it were, in order to  save democracy .  That is quite a burden to place on such a slim book, of which 30% of the Kindle version is an index that only the publisher s lawyers could have derived any benefit from. I do think it is an important book in that it cogently summarises everything the world has suspected about Trump to date   his cognitive problems, his lack of empathy, his narcissism, etc.   as well as issuing a dire warning about the upcoming election.  It is highly unlikely that Trump will go gently into that good night, and there are already ominous signs that he intends to destabilise the US to the point where (a) an election cannot be held as per normal or (b) where the outcome is in danger of being contested.  This was certainly not a happy reading experience, and I found it hard to judge if Mary Trump indulges in too much  doom and gloom  blues. The picture she paints of the Trump household is one so dysfunctional that it seems almost Dickensian.  While Mary Trump manages to control her feelings with steely determination throughout, which is perhaps why it is such a grim and pervasively dark read, her composure slips at a crucial point. Here she allows emotion to trump her own clinical distance:   21 book reviews:  He s Frankenstein without a conscience.    Basically, Donald is a sociopath and a narcissist, just like his father, Fred, Sr.  Mary talks a lot about Fred, Sr. and her father Freddy (Fred, Jr.), but I think it s important to see how Fred, Sr. created the monster we know today, as well as compare and contrast Donald and Freddy s personalities. In his father s eyes, Donald could do no wrong and Freddy could do nothing right.  Some of the things Fred, Sr. taught Donald is absolutely appalling. Donald never learned honest work, because his father never demanded it; in fact, his father rewarded him even when he failed. Donald learned that monetary value was human value and the more you give, the less you have. He was taught that lying was okay and apologizing was weakness. Mary said that Donald was never held accountable for his actions growing up, so he learned early on that he could get away with anything and he still believes it. His family nurtured his selfish, unprincipled, and unfeeling behavior. She commented,  Dehumanization was common at the dinner table.  She blames her family for Donald s behavior, and in a way, she s not holding him accountable any more than her family.  I loved how Mary called Donald  a serially bankrupt businessman and gameshow host.  She was careful in her wording such as  He may have had help from Putin to swing the election in his favor  and he may have a learning disability. There were many examples of when Fred, Sr., financially bailed out Donald with his endless debts from repeated financial mistakes including when he owned three casinos in the same area. He foolishly tried to run them as he did the apartment buildings they owned. I don t understand why banks kept loaning him money when he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. He made a disgusting comment about Mary s breasts when she was in her 20s that no uncle should say to his niece. He described some women as ugly, fat, slobs, or something to that effect. She did mention things we ve all heard long ago such as how he may have hired illegal immigrants when building Trump Tower and how he cheated on the SAT in college by paying a friend to take the test for him.    Five bankruptcies. That s about it.   *** Trump 's niece is a clinical psychologist writing a tell-all. I ca not think of a more qualified person to give us that psychiatric evaluation that we are all dying to read, because we all know that there is something seriously wrong with the man. ***  22 book reviews: Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World 's Most Dangerous Man by Mary L. Trump is a book that shows a lot of courage on the author 's part. The Donald is not known for being kind to those who say or do anything that he finds offensive. He has had it out with the author before and because he did not care for his brother he does not care for his brother 's kids. We the readers learn a great deal about the whole bizarre family in this book. I wo not give anymore good parts away but The Don is a jerk at a young age and just grew into a bigger one because people let him. His father was just like him, or he was like his father. Cold, cruel, and emotionless, heartless. His mother did not want him around, the family tolerated him because of fear? I do not know. He did lots of shady deals behind their backs too! The Don the Con was not picky who he picked on. Family was fair game. I think she probably has another full book or two worth of material she could dish up. I will be glad to read them. I want something juicier next time.    23 book reviews: Can t wait to chug some bleach, gas some Americans, and find out how my niece is doing!!! 24 book reviews: after reading a lot of speculation and not a lot of substance. it contributes little to the conversation.  before reading I was not going to read this book, but then I read that a judge temporarily blocked the publication. This book will get published. I now intend to read it as soon as I can after it happens.  25 book reviews: It 's high time someone spoke out publicly, no holds barred, against America 's most destructive president. In Too Much and Never Enough Donald Trump s niece, of all people, did it--and well.  The book is invaluable. Mary Trump knew Donald Trump starting very young and spent a lot of time in his childhood home through the years. As a psychologist, she s in a unique position to combine this knowledge with objective facts from the field of psychology. Since the care people receive as children leaves an indelible mark, dictating future behavior, tendencies, and outlook, the book goes a long way in shedding light on why Trump is so abnormal. Newer insider accounts, although interesting, are merely expos s in comparison, with the weakest telling readers nothing they don t already know. Not the book by his niece.  In her observation, Mary Trump believes her uncle Donald ticks most boxes for a few disorders (she mentions narcissism and sociopathy, along with others) but refrains from presenting any official diagnosis. She does feel sure that Trump s dad was a high-functioning sociopath. With such a man for a father and a mother who was often emotionally absent and unloving, the five Trump children had a heartbreaking life. In particular, Mary Trump s father (and Trump s oldest brother), Freddy, was treated to a special brand of cruelty for daring to forge his own path and not take over the family business.  From the outside, the Trumps were an American success story--Donald Trump s father, the son of German immigrants, made hundreds of millions and built a huge home for his family--but everything inside was rotten. No amount of material goods can ever compensate for psychological trauma. Reading Donald Trump s childhood history, I was reminded of one of my favorite aphorisms:  The best things in life aren t things.   I found especially helpful in explaining Trump s bizarre penchant for exaggeration and outright lies that claim the exact opposite of the reality. The proclivity was very possibly there at birth, but it s undeniable this behavior was learned, both for approval from his hard-to-please father and for business purposes. The name of the game for Trump is to repeat a lie over and over until people believe the lie is actually a truth (). His unscrupulous father lied and cheated without hesitation and was rewarded handsomely in profits.  If the book accomplishes one thing, it s that it illustrates the significance of the early years, specifically relationships with caregivers, in shaping a person s psyche. In doing that, it highlights the pointlessness of trying to appeal to whatever shred of empathy and basic human decency Donald Trump might have. the capacity for empathy and decency were present when he was born, it doesn t matter now because he was emotionally numbed to the point of no return when he was a tiny boy.  isn t an impersonal clinical report. Mary Trump devoted many pages to her father s tragic story, a story that underscores well how atrocious Donald Trump s parents were especially. Her clear love for her father and deep sorrow over his abysmal treatment makes the book more emotional; it s not just a simple take-down of Trump. She picked up steam in the epilogue as she tore into her uncle and, toward the very end, the media. She scolded the media for going easy on Trump in interviews when he was campaigning--never really holding his feet to the fire, too often allowing him to get away with deflecting and evading. She criticized them further for dismissing Trump s sexism and racism as mere idiosyncrasies. She feels that if the media had been harder on Trump, America might not have this megalomaniac for a president now. As a clinical psychologist, Mary Trump must be objective, but she s still a human being, an American citizen at the mercy of Trump as much as any other American citizen, and she s scared and angry.  Upon finishing, I m left wondering only whether Mary Trump would have written this book had her father not been treated like dirt and later disinherited. I want to believe she would have, that she s an upstanding person with a conscience, but I think it s obvious that what happened to her dad was the catalyst for her breaking from the family and thinking independently (or at least, there s no evidence to the contrary). But that s ok--and it doesn t matter. Mary Trump s reasons are irrelevant because she so excellently shed light on the motivations behind Donald Trump s dangerous actions. Like most people, I ve wondered why Donald Trump seems completely incapable of simply doing the right thing--at all, at least once. I ve felt--and continue to feel now more than ever--sick over the staggering damage he s created and the even greater threat he ll be to American democracy if he s reelected. I ve been utterly baffled as to he does what he does. I understand now.  Trump s supporters skewer the book, asserting that Mary Trump wrote this for the profits alone or out of revenge or to hurt Trump s reelection chances or something else--anything to resolve their and keep feeling good about voting for an unabashed criminal. My wish is that some of Trump s staunchest supporters will be curious enough to read . If they put this man on a pedestal, they ought to at least understand the person they worship. They ought to ask themselves, very honestly, whether someone so scarred is even of running an entire country, with its diverse citizenry. They need to imagine reading Mary Trump s account with the names changed and then asking themselves whether the person profiled is one they d choose to lead their nation.  By now, several books on Donald Trump have been written. should be the first read. This page-turner is a gift to a broken U.S., and if any book has the power to prevent Donald Trump s reelection, it s this one.  26 book reviews: Dear Ms. Trump,  I thank you for writing this book. I thank you with all my heart. If enough undecided voters should read your book, you might save not only America but the whole world. (Unfortunately, the chances for this are small.)  Yours truly,  Lilo Huhle-Poelzl   I will not write a review of this book, because many of my Goodreads friends have already written excellent and very informative reviews. I fully endorse the following reviews, to which I give the links:  Elyse Walter 's review:   Will Byrnes 's review:   Betsy Robinson 's review:   Lisa Vegan 's review:   Jill Meyer 's review   andy 's review:   aPriL 's review:   Linda 's review:   ALL I PERSONALLY WANT TO SAY IS: Taking from this very believable book, if one had taken a random, not-so-very-bright 7-year old with a terribly flawed character and placed him into the White House as President of the United States, he could not have done a worse job, and he might not even be quite as dangerous.  27 book reviews: 28 book reviews: Great as a psychology book. Interesting and poignant autobiography & biography of a family.  I enjoyed the writing style and think that the book is mostly well written.  That the case subject in the title of the book currently wields so much power is alarming.  There was nothing included that was surprising to me but the background information was exceedingly helpful for understanding and most of it I hadn t known.  Her shocked reaction election night was similar to mine and to that of most of the people I know.  There isn t much  there  there when it comes to Donald Trump so thankfully this book is not only about him. A lot of this story is interesting. I read it as an autobiography (Mary 's) and the biography of her extended family. It 's not all Donald all the time. Frankly, there is not  enough  of him to really make a book. What s there is creepy, infuriating, tragic, annoying, nothing good. I don t know what else to say about that except that as I read I found it depressing, demoralizing, infuriating, scary, and incredibly sad, and grateful that it was written & published.  Mary Trump has cause to feel bitter and sorrowful. Anybody capable of empathy (not her uncle or grandfather) will feel for her and will feel for all the people who ve suffered because of Donald and others in the family. That goes for the suffering of the now millions/perhaps billions Impacted by the current United States Presidential administration. My heart broke many times over for several specific people.  Even if Donald were a nobody and this family was unknown with no celebrities it would be an fascinating book and would be worthwhile to read.  This book is as much about the author Mary and especially her father and also her mother, brother, and nephew, and her grandfather/Donald s father, and quite a few others. As I read I thought more about them than I did about Donald and also more about the bullies and sadists who ve impacted my life and most of all those voters who didn t vote for Hillary in 2016 (our only alternative) and those who still support Trump. I hope that people in those latter two groups of people read this book, follow legitimate news, and educate themselves before the 2020 election. I also continued to think a lot about most of our politicians and most media and how they are not doing proper jobs when it comes to containing Donald and reporting about him.  While this is valuable as a personal account it is also well researched. I appreciated the index in the back of the book. The fact that the author is a firsthand witness and also is a professional psychologist gives her analysis and observations additional validity.  This is a topical book and it is up to date within a month or two up to date as of now.  I highly recommend this book to all readers of non-fiction no matter what their political and other beliefs or what they think of Donald Trump. I believe that more understanding of people and situations is always better than ignorance. It doesn t even matter what readers  politics are because this isn t an inherently political book. It s a book about the destructiveness and dangerousness of many members of a dysfunctional family. I also suggest reading other reviews of this book. (Spoilers are really not a problem with this sort of account, in my opinion.) I particularly appreciated Caroline s excellent review:  29 book reviews: I wish I could say the book was very enlightening, but it only confirmed what is obvious to anyone who isn t blindly enchanted by Donald Trump s idiot factor. The man is a self-absorbed criminal and fraud to put it very mildly.  The book focused more on the dysfunction of the Trump family, and the role Donald Trump s father played in feeding and creating the dysfunction.  I ve giving the book and audio 5 stars because it s not a question of being a Republican or Democrat. It s about being Anti-Donald Trump.  ",
    " Untamed": "book reviews: Audiobook... read by Glennon Doyle  My thoughts and feelings changed  several  times - from positive to negative - back to positive- back to negative!!! By the end.... I was just glad to be DONE!  If this book was  clearly  a memoir... I wouldn t have felt annoyed.  I often didn t buy her strategies in achieving emotional balance -because  she  lacked balance in important areas of life: true empathy for others.  Glennon will ALWAYS put her needs and desires  before  others. She demonstrated several times how she swung that pendulum from being a person who didn t know how to please herself to no longer pleasing anyone.  Glennon s selfish tone towards others was brutal - rather than unflinching honest. She was down right mean, righteous at times. I began to wonder if Glennon had respect for  anyone  other than herself. Does she realize that many women know who they are? We don t all judge our value ourselves by the size of thighs?   Part  of being a whole contributing human being is sometimes putting other people s needs first ( at cause), before our own. Glennon is not there yet.... she still needs to  prove  that she s her own woman goddamnit!! Power to Glennon!  This review would make ZERO DIFFERENCE to Glennon. She said herself, she doesn t give a rats ass about my opinion - or what I think of her, anyway. So how do people contribute  back  to her? Where is her opening to  hearing  that there might be a reason some of us readers  might  (the Glennon sin?), feel she has a few things to still learn about the balance between being who we are - without verbally purging righteousness onto others.  Glennon clearly  states she only cares about herself - over and over and over again. Yes... this is a happy world with Glennon s savvy wisdom. She transferred one disorder  (over-eating, purging, over drinking, trouble with the law,), to a self serving shaming-others for not being like  her .  PARTS WERE GOOD - in the beginning - until she chewed the human race to threads!  Her self righteous me me me - ME FIRST - no-pleasing others rule became annoying. I lost total respect!!!  I appreciated a few chapters in this book... I liked her  own  discovery about parenting - and where she went south in giving her son the message that his life (studying for school, tests the next day, etc.), were more important than his responsibility as a contributing member to the family. After Glendon s realization- that she was raising a self- centered - self serving kid- she made corrections. She began to demand his respect and contributions to the family. Now her kid did the dishes after dinner -(she made the meal after all). Glennon s  a-ha  moments of parenting  discoveries  .... that raising a privileged son wasn t doing him any long term service, was admirable. I had much respect for Glennon s  moral  discovery  I wished I had made that discovery myself when I was raising our daughters, myself. I  allowed  our daughters to do their homework ( skip dishes) because why? because their life wellness out in  their  world was more important than them  contributing  to  our  family. I did the fricken dishes - I made the meals - I did the cleaning - Paul supported our family financially. Hell - I made their lunches - drove them to their many activities every single day - ( private independent schools, music lessons, sports, dance, theater, Hebrew school, etc) I was their slave and I was wrong!!! I never taught them to sincerely value and respect Paul and I. Guess what? Both daughters are successful in the world and independent - but only one of them respects Paul and I fully and expresses it. So... I felt that Glendon did have some very valuable insights into the role of parenting. But... I never got the impression that she respected her own parents. She patted herself on the back about how great she was.   So... I thought Glennon shared some useful tips about parenting from morality rather than kids accomplishments in the outside world.  However, every time Glennon moved away from  sharing  her experiences - and started preaching her views - I lost total respect for her.  Glennon is  not  a talented compassionate INSPIRATIONAL or SPIRITUAL leader... Her lack of empathy and appropriate speaking skills fell apart.  I spent a couple of days trying to figure out what it was that she did that DROVE ME NUTS.... She was self serving and annoying in her ME FIRST Philosophy. Too much swinging-that pendulum with her good girl/ bad girl themes.  ...Glennon is a recovered alcoholic- ...A recovered bulimic- ...A girl who had destroyed all her relationships at one time as well. I m happy Glennon found her own voice - and did some repair work - learned to look inward at her own needs and desires - rather than self harm herself. BUT... I was incredibly embarrassed by many things she said - and the tone in which she said them. Even her words about being a feminist were cringe-shaking off the wall. RIGHTEOUS is as RIGHTEOUS is!!! ( yuck)  It was her ASSUMPTION that most woman were just like her - Only focusing on makeup-clothes- getting others to love  us ... Glennon Doyle crossed the line into PUSHING HER RIGHTEOUSNESS on others.  One minute she talked about nurturing relationships and the next minute she slammed any person who called her on the telephone or sent her a text message for the gall of interrupting her life.  My God then she compared the last presidential race to the apocalypse. What the hell?  I think this is the last book I ever plan to read by Glennon Doyle. She s not Eckhart Tolle, Bren  Brown, Lama Surya Das, or Don Miguel Ruiz....  This is a MEMOIR   that bordered closely to PREACHING!  Glennon Doyle is a woman who took many years to find her own voice.... years of healing from self harm - harming others as well. She still has a few loose marbles about the totality of humanity..... I don t want to live inside her  ME FIRST  bubble. There are many shades of gray. Life is not all black or white - as Glennon would have us to believe. She was down right mean to people who asked her questions.  Glennon Doyle is not a person I trust to teach me HOW TO BE A POWERFUL WOMEN!  2.5 stars - rating down.  1 book reviews: Elitist Drivel  For those looking for an old school rant review, today is your lucky day.  I have so many thoughts and words floating through my head right now that I am struggling to formulate a review - which almost never happens.    In fact, speaking of \"struggle...\"  This book was a struggle to get through. And I have a feeling it matches the struggle of being Glennon Doyle and living inside Glennon 's Doyle 's head - ALL of which is created and meticulously curated by Glennon Doyle.  Seriously though, she is the driver of her own self-mechanized Struggle Bus, yet acts like she has overcome monumental life suffering derived from forces outside her own damn self.    But I will come back to that.  First, I want to say (before I forget to do so) that I was really looking forward to reading this. The blurb sounded awesome. A former Christian mommy-blogger who reinvents herself upon meeting and falling in love with a woman? Sign me up.  Key word there, though: INVENTS. Because hardly anything about this book felt authentic.  In fact, this book felt like nothing more than an elitist American white woman (who has never truly suffered from anything more than low self-esteem) attempting to prove how \"woke\" she is because, hey, she 's a lesbian now, yo, and just rocking life so much better than you.  For the first 50 pages, she had me totally on board and I was enjoying her story and her message.  But then the completely self-righteous (and yet wholly indeterminate) lecturing about every buzz-word topic on the planet started. Motherhood? Racism? Feminism? Toxic masculinity? The dangers of technology and its effects on mindfulness?  Step aside, peons, because Glennon Doyle has this shit ALL figured out. And she will tell you all about it. Because she it more than you.  The fact that she - a grown ass middle/upper class married American woman with three children - did not even know how to buy her own plane ticket? Irrelevant. She still adults SO much better than you. Because trusts her \"knowing.\" And because I do what I want, losers.    And do not get even get me started on how much she contradicts herself and makes her complete hypocrisy blatantly obvious whilst still lecturing us all on how we should be doing things.  In one chapter, she talks about how she was a \"good parent\" to her first daughter, but then \"got tired....[and] by the time [her third child] exited the birth canal, [she] just handed her an iPad and wished the child godspeed on her journey.\"  She talks about how this made her third child SO #independent and confident in who she is...and then turns around and talks about how she decided to take her son 's cell phone away because it was stifling his \"creativity\" and causing him to withdraw from life. She, of course, includes the whole conversation she later had with her son (her firstborn) about taking away said cell phone...a conversation in which she, of course, sounds like a mage-mother with woke mom skills. Because, you know, #stillbetterthanyou.  And while on the topic of phones...she later discusses how her friend Erika called her cell phone. Poor Erika.     Wow.    I have no words. That quote basically encompasses so much about this woman. She is so sensitive, she is \"damaged\" by her friend calling her, you know, to be a FRIEND. And she prefers texts, but does not answer them, because (again) I do what I want and refuse to be a part of your damned patriarchy. But here is your iPad, sweetie.  She is also so damned sensitive and \"empathetic\" that she RECENTLY became so tired, hungry, and concerned while watching on TV that her wife had to remind her that, do not worry, he would be okay. Because TELEVISION. And PRODUCTION TEAM.  And I am supposed to give a fuck what this woman thinks about real world issues?    Nope.  I would continue to include more contradictory quotes and stories - of which there are MANY. But I just ca not be bothered to think or talk about this woman and her book one second longer. In fact, the minute I finish this review, both this book and my thoughts about it are headed for the bin.  Because I can do what I want too.  2 book reviews: I totally get why people would find this book cheesy but as someone who also realized she s queer pretty late in life, I really enjoyed reading about her revelations and decision to prioritize her feelings and self-actualization. So maybe I just read this at the right time :)  These quotes particularly resonated with me:  \"I did not know, before that woman told me, that all feelings were for feeling. I did not know that I was supposed to feel everything. I thought I was supposed to feel happy. I thought that happy was for feeling and that pain was for fixing and numbing and deflecting and hiding and ignoring. I thought that when life got hard, it was because I had gone wrong somewhere. I thought that pain was weakness and that I was supposed to suck it up. But the thing was that the more I sucked it up, the more food and booze I had to suck down.\"  \"First: I can feel everything and survive. What I thought would kill me, did not. Every time I said to myself: I ca not take this anymore--I was wrong. The truth was that I could and did take it all--and I kept surviving. Surviving again and again made me less afraid of myself, of other people of life. I learned that I would never be free from pain but I could be free from the fear of pain, and that was enough. I finally stopped avoiding fires long enough to let myself burn, and what I learned was that I am like that burning bush: The fire of pain wo not consume me. I can burn and burn alive. I can live on fire. I am fireproof. Second: I can use pain to become.\"  Why I m not rating this book 5 stars is because I didn t feel as engaged in the second half. While I really loved the way she opened up in the first half about her experience falling in love with a woman and realizing she s queer, the second half lacked a narrative thread and fell into a pattern of anecdotes with philosophical notions. I admire how self-reflective and spiritual she is (I wish I had more of those qualities!) but the book starts to border on preachiness where she talks like she s giving a sermon. And there was one random chapter where she talked about unlearning racism and I was just like  ok good for you I guess? This is definitely the kind of book that I can see white feminists and religious liberals eating up, I m just not quite in that demographic haha.  3 book reviews: According to my kindle, I made it 71% of the way through this book before I called the time of death. The themes of honoring yourself, busting societal boundaries, and fighting inequality were appealing and honorable. But they didn t feel honest. Glennon uses direct quotes to express exchanges that happened years prior. The quotes are too perfect. It s the phrasing we d use if we had years to reframe conversations and an editor to clean up the narrative. She s lead a remarkable life. I m sure the polishing was intended for the ease of the reader, but it created a disconnect I couldn t see past.  4 book reviews: I wanted to like this book and I am sure for most this book is inspirational and empowering. I agree with her core message, I just found the whole book annoying. I can t put my finger on it. 5 book reviews: I wish I could UNREAD this. 6 book reviews: Bland White feminism, paired with self-fan fiction. 7 book reviews: I am not the target audience for this book, but I am glad she found her path and a loving partner. 8 book reviews: Did you hear choo choo sound of disappointment train! Yes, I heard it, I ve been there, done that! And can you feel the approaching steps of  unpopular review : yes, it s coming right now One step, two step, three step: And here we are: I m about to give two stars one of the books inspired and got so many great reviews from the readers. I wish I could be one of them. I wish I could carry a happy smile after reading this memoir and clap my hands to show my devotion and respect to the author. Nope, it s not gonna happen!  Firstly: I felt like I turned myself into a Foucault Pendulum because my feelings kept swinging between love and hate. I didn t have so many negative and positive reactions to a book at the same time. But unfortunately negativity defeated the power of positive thoughts. The beginning of the book was so promising: Glennon is strong woman: recovered alcoholic, bulimic, humanitarian, activist, wife and mother of three falls in love. At the first time in her life she knows the other person is the one: somebody truly stole her heart and finding your soulmate is just a start for her self-discovery and the beginning of self-journey.  I don t have any problem about Glennon s life choices and thoughts because I always show respect people s decisions about their own lives even though I do not like those decisions. But sometimes putting someone s needs before your own doesn t mean you re sacrificing yourself or you re martyr of your damned path you chose for yourself. It means GIVING and SHARING. There is thin line between respecting yourself by choosing your own needs and being shellfish by always putting your own needs before someone else s. In this book: I didn t like the way of Glennon s treatment to her loved ones and I found her tone harsh, self-righteous and close to be narcissist. When I m reading the pages I feel like Taylor Swift s  Me! Me! Me!  was playing over and over in my head.  At some parts way of telling her evolving life story was irritating. I just visualized her as a religious leader who thinks her devoted fans, worshippers may start to scream  Amen  for each word comes out her mouth because she just drew a portrait of herself similar to this vision At that part 80 s Madonna s popular song started playing in my head with my alternated version;   Glennon, don t preach, I m in trouble deep, Glennon, don t preach I ve been losing sleep.   I am so happy her journey resulted well for her and she finally found her true happiness but her ways to earn that freedom in expanse to hurt the loved ones around her and the way of justifying her actions like  Her way or high way  kind of know-it-all communication style didn t work well for me. Sorry that s not the inspirational story I ve been looking for maybe that s about my character and the way of looking to the matters are quite opposite. I can accept the opposite opinions but that doesn t mean they re the right ones. There are so many different approaches and so many different angles of the reality.  I know Glennon doesn t give any shit my opinion and anyone disagrees her meaningful, full of wisdom thoughts of hers. But I still write, express and tell how I feel. Sorry, it seems like I m not the right reader for this journey!      9 book reviews: I guess I was expecting this to be more of a memoir rather than a lecture 10 book reviews: DNF  I got about 2 hours into the audiobook (18%) and had to stop.  She had me at first, with the cheetah story and being locked in cages created by those around us. How important it is to find our wild again, and let it be what dictates our choices.  But then she got into going into herself to find God, or the thing she no longer refers to as God, and letting that be what guides her decisions and she started to lose me.  I also lost count of how many times she said she was a bestselling author.  It also bothered me that she essentially told us that she wrote her last book dishonestly, in order to fulfill a narrative she had in her head, a vision of how she saw her life going. Makes me wonder how much to trust this one.  11 book reviews: Love Warrior is one of my all-time favorite memoirs. I ve never read an author be so honest about their flaws, so completely vulnerable and exposed to the world. With everything out on the table, she delivers stories that are truly gut-wrenching, inspiring, and ultimately uplifting. I recommend it to 100% of my writer friends who are working on memoirs. It s that good.  Untamed is the follow-up to that book, and a lot has happened since then. Notably, Glennon has divorced her husband and married a woman. It s immediately clear that she s also coming into this book from a much stronger, healthier state of mind. For the most part, Love Warrior is about what it took to rise out of rock bottom. Untamed is about what it s like to have learned.  A majority of the book--I d say 60%--are the philosophies of Doyle as a woke feminist. She does a lot of before and after, such as this is what I used to think and this is what I think now. There are still revealing passages of vulnerability, which I find her greatest talent, but she also writes wonderfully from a position of strength. Her metaphor of a caged cheetah is an excellent opening that sets the tone for the book and her philosophies.  As for criticisms, I will say that most of the book is probably preaching to the choir. As a feminist I didn t really need another rant on the depiction of women in magazines. I agree with everything she says, but there s a brief stretch where it feels unnecessary to beat that dead horse.  Unlike the gritty truth of Love Warrior, I feel some of the anecdotes in here get cheesy. When describing her parenting strategies, for example, every line of dialogue comes out  Leave it to Beaver  perfect, with her teenage children leaping to disown their cell phones, pick up extra chores, and talk about their deepest feelings in a car full of peers. I don t doubt she s a wonderful mother and I m sure her children are angels, but please. I don t even have kids and I rolled my eyes.  All in all, I think the book succeeds as a call to action, a form of group therapy, and poignant self-reflection. Women--and men--have bottled these feelings and been  caged  by them for centuries. It s hard to read Doyle and not feel freed.  12 book reviews: Since I am African/MexicanAmerican, I have a hard time reading memoirs sometimes especially when it is from the White Woman perspective, however I really enjoyed the story Glennon Doyle wrote. Doyle is able to write about finding and being true to yourself but is able to drop gems of information even though she comes from a place of privilege- which she acknowledges herself. I want to give this book to every person I know to read with the hopes that they take away from it what I did which is letting down your guard, being who you want to be, and having compassion for the world.  13 book reviews: I think this book is more self-help than it is memoir, and the memoir parts were way more interesting. First off: I have a real problem with the author describing herself as  caged.  I think middle-class, college educated white women really overestimate and catastrophise the kind of disadvantages they face from being women. We are all certainly confined by cultural and social values that are arbitrary. I would not call being in an unhappy marriage  caged.  There are actual people in cages in America, they re called prisons and detention centres. Some people can t afford to feed themselves and their families. Some people are worried about getting shot by the authorities, or when they go to school. Some people have had their land stolen off them, and she s living on it in her nice waterfront house she mentions. Just some perspective, middle class white women, would be GREAT. The jargon. Omg the the metaphors and the jargon. It was all too twee and relentless. This woman sounds insufferable. She s constantly proselytising to her friends these amazing sermons where she uses all these metaphors, and quite frankly, I do not buy that this author is that well spoken and articulate and enlightening at all times. NO ONE IS. It s very  and then everyone clapped  tumblr story for me. The peak sanctimoniousness of this book had to be where she mentioned that all her friends were activists and artists and therefore they just ~cared~ more deeply than us normie philistines. Or more than the people actually effected by the problems she and her friends are so nobly trying to solve. Also, it s a weird policy to only be friends with people with mental illnesses. I didn t find that funny, just a really reductive assessment of mental illness as something that makes someone inherently more interesting. I don t want to sound really curmudgeon-y about this book, because I certainly did take some valuable insights from it, but I was largely rolling my eyes at the incessant metaphors and anecdotes where the author always says perfect things to people that encapsulated both their problems and solution. Permission slips. Your knowing. You could actually play a drinking game for every time she mentions that she wants to make a true, beautiful life. Good luck to anyone uncynical enough to find this shit helpful and revelatory, that means you re definitely the kind of person that does hot yoga and has some  nevertheless she persisted  merch and i feel entirely comfortable judging those kinds of people *shrug emoji*  14 book reviews: Only rounded up for Abby. Otherwise, this is too Rachel Hollis-y for me. Not sure where the hype for this book came from but... pretty cover! 15 book reviews: This is a sacred day to me. The most important thing I ve ever written my new book UNTAMED is available for the first time TODAY.  I m often asked why I don t publish books more often. My answer is this: I never write a new book until I ve become a new woman. Over the past few years, I became a new woman. UNTAMED tells that story.  At an event for LOVE WARRIOR, a woman walked into the room and the moment I saw her, three words filled my entire being: There She Is. I knew, from my roots, that she was my person. To honor that knowing to honor myself I dismantled and rebuilt my entire life. Loving Abby and creating a life with her was the first decision I ever made not as a good girl, but as a free woman.  UNTAMED is my deeply personal story of discovering, fighting for, and claiming the great love of my life. But this book is not about finding your Abby. It is about finding yourself.  UNTAMED is about how we got caged by the world s expectations of us, and how we break free. It is about how to reclaim yourself, love yourself, trust yourself and abandon others  expectations so you can stop abandoning yourself.  It s the story of how I learned, through my relationship with Tish, that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows her children how to bravely live. It s about how I stopped being a martyr and started being a model.  It s the story of how I learned through my divorce and blending my family that a  broken family  is one in which any member has to break herself to fit in. And a whole family is one in which each member has the freedom to bring her entire self to the family table: to remain whole and still belong.  It s the story of how I learned to set boundaries, make peace with my body, channel my anxiety, and honor my anger. It s about how I finally discovered the big deal about sex.  It s about how when we stop pleasing and start living we become women who can finally look at ourselves dead in the eyes and say: There She Is.  Today I am asking you to pre-order UNTAMED. Even if you usually wait until a book hits the library, or buy it the week it s out, please consider ordering today.  It matters to me and to other authors that you vote for our art by buying it as soon as you can. It signals that there are people who believe in our work, which allows us to keep making it. The UNTAMED team is a handful of fierce, dedicated women. We have been working for two years in preparation for today. Your pre-order today means more than I can tell you.  Here s another reason to order today. We are doing a special signed print run of UNTAMED that includes a beautiful page with the cover art and the vital question: What Would You Do If You Trusted Yourself?  I am going to sign every copy of this limited printing. Think of your people who are going through the thick   in other words, all of your people   and consider gifting them, and yourself, a special signed copy of UNTAMED. Once this first printing is gone, there won t be any more. We don t know if the quantity will last two hours or two weeks, so please order for yourself and your people today. Signed copies are available through independent bookstores, Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million HERE.  In the coming weeks, as I sign each book in the limited print run, I will be sending my love and a personal blessing to each of you. I don t know if that woo-woo stuff works but it makes me so happy and thankful that each of these books will go from my couch to yours, my hands to yours, my heart to yours.  When I finished writing, I sent UNTAMED to Liz Gilbert. She read it and wrote to me:  This book will liberate women emotionally, spiritually, and physically. I believe you were born to write this book.  It s true. I finally freed myself enough to be able to say what I ve been desperate to say for my entire life.  My dream is that since freedom, joy, and peace are contagious they will leap off each page of UNTAMED and into your hearts until each of us is free to live as the people we were born to be before the world told us who to be.  I LOVE YOU. I LOVE US. G  16 book reviews: It has been a while since I have loathed a book so fully as I did that wash your face book. I suppose it was time to find one that I was not just bored by, or indifferent about. I detested every page of this nonsensical, self-indulgent, inauthentic word salad. The bold, beautiful cover is as much of a deception as she admits her last two memoirs were. 17 book reviews: I was really disappointed by this book, especially after seeing such great reviews everywhere. The overview seemed promising, but I found so much of it repetitive. A lot of the shorter essays, focusing generally on injustices or world observations, ended right as they got interesting. The broad claims about gender inequality or cultural expectations are not new or groundbreaking; I do not mean that they should not be written about (actually I think the exact opposite), but Doyle is not adding any substance to the discussion. While I respect her life and the journey she took to get where she is today, the writing was not effective in conveying any meaning or weight. I found it really annoying and self righteous. It was a struggle to finish...  18 book reviews: Abysmal, smug and sanctimonious. I am confident we will be reading about her next divorce soon. 19 book reviews: There are not enough words for how much I loved this book. It was exactly what I needed during this strange time. It grounded me, brought me back to myself, and made me feel a little calmer. I hope to return to this often (something I am not very good at doing). It was hard not to underline almost everything, and I used about a million book darts to mark passages I loved and want to remember or read again. If you are a fan of Elizabeth Gilbert, Cheryl Strayed, and Brene Brown, I think this one will resonate with you.  20 book reviews: The whole thing felt like an overcompensation. For what? I don t know exactly. It was like during the whole book she was just trying to convince us, and herself, that she got it right this time. Her little revelations weren t exactly groundbreaking. Trite sayings. This book is way overblown 21 book reviews: Firstly, the format of the book feels a bit disjointed, as if I was simply reading a bound collection of blog posts rather than a cohesive book. After reading Love Warrior, I was interested in her story of what took place afterwards, how she was able to reconcile her faith and move forward with her life. Readers looking for this will be left wanting and personally, I felt as though instead of reconciling her faith, she has traded it for a brand of moralistic therapeutic deism.  Much like Love Warrior, there are clips and phrases resonate deeply within me in terms of life experience as a wife and a mother, but there are many more parts that make me feel like I am teetering on the edge of a dangerous theology of which the basis is that life is ultimately intended to be lived for oneself; that self-truth is the only thing that matters and that we must sacrifice everything and everyone for whatever we deem to be our truth at any given moment in our lives.  Her work should challenge each of us to examine what we truly believe about this life, our marriages, our faith, our relationships and our parenting. After all, that is what good art is intended to do; however, I worry for the scores of women who will simply accept her truth as their own, and proclaim as their anthem that they will, \"do whatever the f*ck they want to do\" because that is simply what Glennon says is brave and right and true.  If anything is to be gleaned from Glennon 's writings, it is not that we must choose to abide by her truth, but that we each must choose by which truth we are going to abide.  22 book reviews: Everyone was talking about this book and so I got it. Now all these people need to give the two days back to me that I spent reading this crap. The tone is so self righteous, like I have figured everything out and you re weak and you don t listen to yourself nonsense. Also, who the hell has conversations like the ones written in this book? And that too for very general everyday things. And when someone asked her to repeat what she had said, she was like oh I can t say it again but here it is in the book when she couldn t even repeat it to the person she said it to. Everything annoyed me in this book.  23 book reviews: I know authors who write books like this polish up conversations that they recount in order to make them more coherent and meaningful in the rear view mirror. But oh my god. The conversations with the authors kids, ex husband, wife, therapist, friends and family were so incredibly self aggrandizing. Pretty much half this book for me was filed under  oh I m SURE that s exactly how it happened  *eye roll*. I m also definitely not the target audience  none of the narrative about finding myself really resonated. Perhaps better for someone who feels stuck in life. Also I did not like the format of random short stories and vignettes. It made it hard to follow.  24 book reviews: I had no idea who Glennon Doyal was, prior to reading this book.   To be honest, I likely wouldn t have picked this one up, had it not been on Reese Witherspoon s book picks.   This self-help style book is simply not my jam. While a lot of what she had to say was poignant and smart, it still had the self help preach feel for me. 25 book reviews: Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. This cracked open so many internal and emotional doors! It 's both beautiful and cathartic while remaining grounded and graceful fuzed with so much empowerment. This is by far one of the most inspirational and relatable books I have read in a while (and that is saying a lot). I will be returning to this one all the way into my late womanhood.  26 book reviews: I wrote a review when I was 3/4 of the way done with the book, talking about how hollow and untrue it felt. And now, I have finished the book (finished it several days ago), and I ca not stop thinking about how much I still do not like it, how the author comes off as self-absorbed and sanctimonious.  I wonder if I would have a different reaction to the book if I would read it in the world we lived in before this awful pandemic, and I have no way of knowing the answer.  So, all I can do is write my review from this moment in time, and to say that I truly disliked this book. Truly. I had never read anything by her before, but I heard her on a podcast with Brene Brown, and I decided to buy the book.  There is something so self-congratulatory about her tone and so smug that I could not feel inspired, no matter how much I wanted to. I also felt that she was presenting her life not so much with authenticity and vulnerability but with \"hey, look at me and be like me...and if you ca not, you will never know what the good life is.\" The message I got from this book is that unless I am willing to give up everything, I will never know what life really can be.  Many other reviewers have commented on the dialogue in the book, which is awful. Nobody talks that way, not even characters in an Aaron Sorkin script. No one remembers conversations with that type of recall. And that, combined with the purposefully \"wild\" structure of the book left me feeling irritated, and it 's been a long time since I have been irritated by a book.  I am alarmed that Glennon Doyle is lauded as the voice of feminine empowerment because her book comes across as steeped in privilege and arrogance. You can only be happy, she seems to say, if you are BFF 's with Liz (Elizabeth Gilbert, of course, famous writer) and if you sit with Oprah at her kitchen table and if you have thousands and thousands of people who will drop everything to listen to you adoringly, and if you are willing to risk everything...  This is neither a memoir, nor a self-help book, nor a coming-out tale. It is simply the self-congratulatory, curated, filtered writings of someone who knows she 's adored and wants us to know she knows.   27 book reviews: Where to start with the mess that is this book? This is long.    First, she is an inconsistent narrator. What editor didn t tell her that she shoots herself in the foot right at the beginning when she basically admits that what she had previously written in books about her life, wasn t true? That she s  not sure if she wrote it and then lived her life to be that, or if it was her actual life,  ya that makes you not trustworthy. In other words,  I could be making up this  truthful  memoir too but you ll never know.   Also, (paraphrased)  I ve been looking for high school  golden sparkle  (or however she termed it) my whole life.  She s in her 40 s! It s time for better life goals than popularity. I don t know Glennon prior to this book and felt myself thinking,  what the heck? why does anyone give this woman so much clout in anything?   She writes from a post-truth standpoint. And just makes stuff up until she can justify her actions. She basically says to throw out all morals and live however you want. Well that s a scary world to live in.  Then, there s the  Christian  aspect of this. She is a Christian. Or was a Christian and is now just  spiritual  but then also tries to quote God-like, spiritual things as if she understands it all, even she isn t sure. But let me be clear friends, what she preaches, is not Christianity. There is no Jesus as redeemer, born again, here. In fact she claims she is perfect. Yup. She said that. Yet, points out faults in others that should change (but what if that s THEIR truth, Glennon?) She has a very pantheistic world view. She has cherry picked from whatever religions/faiths she wants, leaving her with a shallow faith based on nothing. That isn t faith. But it likely makes her feel good because she doesn t have to look at her own brokenness. There is no accountability. It s destructive. She clearly missed what Christianity is even about when she was in church. I don t have an issue if someone doesn t believe the same as me. But I do have an issue when they misrepresent what I believe to the rest of the world. Which she does multiple times in this book.  She pulls stuff from the Bible as if she s an authority on it. I almost lost it when she used the verse  be still and know  as justification that she can find all truth within her (if she s just still enough- what?!). Quoting it as a bible verse, she clearly didn t read the entire verse which says  be still and know that I am God  (not glennon is god- but rather yehweh). I wonder if she actually read the Bible she quotes multiple times.  She preaches such a strong  feminist  view of  every woman for herself. I m the only one I can count on  as if that s a utopia world we all want. Personally, I would prefer a world where we all learn to love and care for one another. Women and men working together as equally valuable to that end. I consider myself a feminist, but I m not anti-male. And I think such thinking does more to harm to everything women are trying to accomplish. We need men on our team and we won t get there by pushing them away. She added nothing new or of value to the conversation.  Then she talks about race. When she s invited to a group with black women, the other white woman tasks herself with researching and glennon tasks herself with... talking about HER experience.   I can t with this woman.  I put her in the same camp as Rachel Hollis. A whole bunch of self absorbed, uneducated, feel-good drivel. I get so annoyed at mommy bloggers being given any sort of platform as if they have actually gone for schooling in the areas that they write about. She writes as if she s got a psychology degree (she didn t. I checked.) but I think it s mostly just her regurgitating stuff she heard in therapy and then adding fluff trying to be  original  and  wise.  She is neither.  I m sure she s a nice person. I think this niceness got her her following, But she is a terrible writer. Friends and followers creating buzz does not a good writer make.  The one  truth  I can agree with her on:  Reject what insults your soul.  That pretty much sums up how I feel about this book. It s insulting the entire way through. I m fully rejecting it.  I finished this book only because I wanted to give it a fair review and I knew a ton of friends would be talking about it. But if it wasn t popular and bound to be talked about, I wouldn t have finished it. If you haven t started it, I wouldn t bother.  28 book reviews: Like every book Glennon writes, Untamed felt like a conversation between my soul and her soul. It 's as if she climbs into my heart space, curls up, puts her hands around my heart and goes \"Listen closely. You need to hear this. Also, I love you. You got this.\" That 's what her books always feel like to me. And then at some point, her words start melding with everything I already know to be true so it 's like my own inner wise woman is speaking to me as I am reading and I am feeling a little stronger and more sure of myself every page I turn.  Untamed was no different. Glennon 's words are a soothing balm and a call to power all at once; a step up and a slow down in one breath. And I think that is exactly what we need right now, to both step up and slow down. Untamed is a manifesto for that. It 's a manifesto for uncovering ourselves, and boldly proclaiming ourselves to the world, bravely holding our ground regardless of what the broader systems' messages are, and then turning inward to be with ourselves in all our brutal and beautiful wholeness. I have folded over so many pages of this book, eagerly awaiting a moment to return so my soul can sit with Glennon 's soul and have a chat once again. And I can walk away a little stronger, my head a little higher; a little more loving, of myself and others; and a little more ready to live untamed.  29 book reviews: Untamed was my first experience with Glennon Doyle, and on the basis of the title I wasn t expecting it to feel quite so, uh, tame. I will air my grievances below.  First, Doyle spends a lot of time talking about how limiting conventional gender roles are for women and girls, which is certainly a worthy topic, but all of her arguments have been around for literally decades, and she doesn t add anything new to the conversation.  Second, while Doyle famously left her husband for a woman (soccer player Abby Wambach), her depiction of that relationship doesn t feel totally honest to me there s a lot of talk about how it was fate and a lot of glossing over of any difficulties. I genuinely wish her well in her new relationship, but you d think by now she d know better than to portray the whole thing as some kind of fairy tale.  Third, she comes across as the most lecture-y person imaginable: by her own portrayal, she s constantly lecturing everyone she knows and always turning every situation around to be about herself. Not only was this tedious to read, but it made me wonder how she has any friends left. The epitome of this comes when she s at an Episcopal church for a reading and, in the minister s office, in front of the minister, she starts lecturing Abby about how Abby is not really an atheist.  Which leads me to the fourth thing that bugs me about this book: Doyle refuses to accept that there might be people out there who don t believe in god. She thinks we all just had bad experiences with church as kids, which turned us off organized religion entirely, and somehow it never occurred to us in all our lives that there might be another way to believe in god, so she s here to inform us that there is, and that s what we must do. If you say you like being out in nature, she ll tell you nature is your god. If you say you like the ocean, she ll tell you the ocean is your god. If you say you like going to McDonald s and getting a Happy Meal, she ll probably tell you the Happy Meal is your god. All the open-mindedness she espouses in this book just doesn t extend to the secular among us. Given how late to the party she was on gender issues, I ll look forward to a book 20 or 30 years hence, where she ll share with all of us her scorching-hot take that atheists can still be good people even if they refuse to call sunsets their god.  I m aware that a lot of women see Doyle as a source of wisdom, although I m not sure why she s a former mommy blogger whose life has frequently been in tatters, and her current advice is all recycled from things feminists, civil rights activists, and Buddhists have been saying for a long time. But I guess it s good that she s trying to be more honest and use her considerable influence in a positive way. For her followers, may be just the book they need. It s not, however, the book that I need. In the new year I will happily go back to ignoring Glennon Doyle s existence, and because I am an atheist, she, I guess, will continue to ignore mine.  ",

    " What Should Danny Do? (The Power to Choose Series)": "book reviews: Danny is just your average  super-hero in training  as he describes himself. He has some super powers (such as jumping and running fast) and he is training to be able to fly. But his dad tells him that his real superpower is  the power to choose  and he provides Danny with an awesome cape that reminds him of this. Our little girls both think that their powers of running and jumping put them on the same level as Danny. They also identify with having potential conflicts with a sibling. There are plenty of  choose your own adventure  books for children. What makes this special is that it allows children to consider the consequences of their feelings as well as their actions. What happens when your brother gets his breakfast on your favorite plate? What would you choose to do when someone laughs at your misfortune? Our  just  seven-year-old had no trouble reading most of it herself and she caught on to the way to follow the storyline through choices. I had to read it all to our four-year-old but she had no problem following the story and making choices. They both enjoyed the illustrations as well as the choices (and I believe it was a good way to enter into some family discussions). 4.5 *  1 book reviews: This book is great, with 9 different ending options, it keeps children engaged for multiple readings. It is a great book to have discussions about good and bad choices, my first graders love to see what happens when they make the choices for Danny. 2 book reviews: Perfect book for my grandson! 3 book reviews: This book exceeded my expectations. Perfectly illustrates the power of choices for children. They really enjoyed making the different choices. Most importantly I ve been able to use it in real life examples by asking them when they are acting up  think of the power of choice, if this were your book and this was the choice you decided what s going to be on the next pages . It actually has worked! Great concept. 4 book reviews: Liam  very loves  this book because  Danny and I both love ninjas and superheroes and dogs and lemonade!   That said, Liam rarely makes the wrong choices for Danny in the book whenever we read it because he dislikes when Danny gets reprimanded.  I dislike how many of Danny s choices receive extrinsic rewards.  But I love that the book provides a concrete way to have active discussions about behavior, choices, and responsibilities with my seven year old.  5 book reviews: I loved this little choose your own book. I chose the naughty track most of the time. I m a rebel! 6 book reviews: A very good children  's book about the power of decision. It has many scenarios for the little ones to choose from and experiment the consequence of their actions/choices. The illustrations are cute and colourful, very clear and even funny. Ok recommend this one to kids above 4. 7 book reviews: It 's when I read books like this and see such a high rating I am reminded how different I am at parenting. Liam was really into this book the boy likes things he likes, has a little brother, wears a cape, turn the page and all the sudden the little boy is being a jerk and just kicking things down hitting his brother being a little shit... I am like... uhhhhh. The responses from mom didnt teach him anything except some negative reinforcement as punishment. Ugh!  The concept was great, the execution not so much. Was almost there. Would have liked more teaching about emotions and natural consequences helping with empathy instead of selfishness.  Disappointing  8 book reviews: Read this with my four year old, seven year old and ten year old. They all loved it and want to read it again tomorrow. They moved helping Danny with choices and discovering the consequences! I am excited for his next book about school! 9 book reviews: Awesome book. Great for discussing choices and consequences. Would enjoy more books like this. 10 book reviews: Parents of strong willed kids, get this book! I got it for my three year old for Christmas. We ve been having some behavior problems, especially at dinner. Tonight he was about to act out at the dinner table and my husband presented him with two options just like in the book.  Would you like to throw your plate on the ground and get in trouble or would you like to eat your dinner and be happy?  Three year old stopped and did a 180 change in attitude. It just shows that the book is making him think about choices and consequences. While reading it our six year old was drawn over to listen and participate as well. It kept both of their attention even while exploring several different endings. In short, I highly recommend this book, especially for children who are, shall we say, asserting their independence in unfortunate ways.  11 book reviews:      :           12 book reviews:                                                     ..                                   13 book reviews: We love reading the What Should Danny Do books at home. The storylines are interesting with realistic consequences (both positive and negative), and the illustrations are wonderful. My son asks to read this all the time. 14 book reviews: What should Danny Do (school day) is an interactive book that incorporates many stories depending on the path the reader chooses. Danny is a young boy, who like many boys and girls, has choices he needs to make throughout his day. For example, at the beginning of the story, Danny needed to get ready for school but was busy playing in his room. The reader is given the chance to choose for Danny, should he continue playing or get ready for school? Depending on the reader 's choice, that will determine what page is next. The reader will discover that the decision they made may have negative consequences or positive outcomes. This is a fun read for all ages! In my class, we have many great discussions on what choices should and could be made. It is also fun to go and see how Danny 's day changed when he made a poor decision. Enjoy this great conversation starter!  15 book reviews: This choose-your-own story picture book is about a little boy and the choices he makes. Very cool illustrations. 16 book reviews: Denijs nav parasts puis ns - vi am piem t k da supersp ja! Denijs nevar ietekm t to, kas ar vi u notiek, bet vi  var izv l ties, k  uz to rea t!

For those of us that grew up with Choose Your Own Adventure books, this will resonate with you. Danny learns that he can change his day by changing his choices. It allows kids to safely make bad choices and see how it affects the outcomes of Danny 's day. Lots of good discussion for younger kids in this book. Bonus there is a 2nd in the series, where you can see Danny 's good and bad choices while he is at school. 18 book reviews: I ve been wanting to read this for a long time, to add to my collection of read-alouds for social emotional learning in my classroom. This book did not disappoint! It s like a  choose your own adventure  for 6 year olds. Danny wants to keep playing in his room, but should he listen to his mom and get ready for school? What happens if he doesn t? I can t wait to use it to help my students think about stopping, thinking, and choosing at school and at home. 19 book reviews: I often say that books give children the opportunity to practice who they want to be in the world, and today 's recommended series gives them not only numerous opportunities to practice, but also a chance to \"live\" the effects of their choices! These books are picture book versions of those Choose Your Own Adventure books (which I LOVED as a child), and are also perfect for fostering positive character traits in your children. I am talking about \"The Power to Choose\" series by Ganit and Adir Levy!   Each book in the \"Power to Choose\" series features a child who has the power to choose both his actions and how his day turns out. Every few pages brings the reader to a choice the character has to make, with an option we know will turn out well and an option that the character may not want to make. Each choice then has logically expected results (for example, when Danny makes a choice to play cooperatively with his brother, their mom decides to take them to the park because they are having such good days, but when he instead knocks his brother 's race car set down, the boys have to clean up the mess and miss out on park time). And at the end of each story combination, Danny and Darla reflect on how their choices determined the course of their days, and what they did well, and what they could do differently next time.   We purchased What Should Danny Do? on our own, and we thank Elon Books for gifting us What Should Darla Do? and What Should Danny Do? School Day, as well as the cape, poster, and stickers. All thoughts and opinions are our own!   The \"Power to Choose\" series is fun, educational, and addictive in the best way possible, reminding us all that we have the power to determine our futures rather than live them passively. You can bet we are going to get our hands on the upcoming What Should Danny Do? On Vacation as soon as possible! Stay tuned tomorrow for a giveaway  3 lucky winners will each win a Danny book and cape of his/her choice!  20 book reviews: What an incredible way of engaging readers! This book has multiple story lines where the reader is left to make decisions for the main character, Danny. This books speaks on the importance of making decisions and owning the consequences or wins of those choices. For students with that lack impulse control, this would definitely put that context into perspective without making it feel personal. When someone tells you to do something different than what you are doing, it might convince you to continue doing. Perfect for children between the age of 3-10. It allows them to challenge the path the Danny will take. As a class, half of the students could come up with bad choices for him and the other half could be good choices. Seeing the consequences or awards would allow students to better understand that power of choice. Some external factors we cannot control but we can control the way we chose to go about our life.  21 book reviews: Gasp. A masterpiece. A \"choose your own adventure\" book aimed at the preschool set, featuring a mundane day of a little boy and his younger brother. The usual annoyances and irritations of childhood ensue (wrong plate; wanting to play with the same toy; falling over your feet and destroying the lemonade stand). The reader is then asked to choose. TO CHOOSE, do you hear me. Do you react with the more typical RAGE AND AGGRESSION AND DESPAIR?! Or do you channel your tiny inner Buddha and say \"ahimsa ahimsa no prob mom\".  FWIW my kid chose attack/despair every time - which ends with Danny having a terrible day indeed - and then was like, \"but i wanna see what happens everywhere else in the book?\" AH HAAAAA, the great lesson is upon us! Same choices = same story, my child!! It was revelatory (and very difficult) for them to choose the Buddha route. I could see the brain gears turning. WONDERFUL. Thank you, book.  22 book reviews: Genre: Choose Your Own Ending (Special Format), Adventure, Social Skills Age: 3 and up Reading Level: 2nd-4th grade/ While this book can be enjoyed by kids as young as preschool older kids would have an easier time reading the words. This is a book in The Power to Choose Series which would be great to use when working on social skills or helping kids understand that their choices have consequences. Even preschool aged kids could use this book as a sounding board for not only discussing the scenarios in the book but they could break up into groups and come up with other ideas or issues that they have faced. I would then have the kids act out the problems they came up with in their groups acting out two different endings. The class could then vote on which one would be the most appropriate.  23 book reviews: I loved reading this book! It 's like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" series book but about making good life choices. Very realistic situations that children find themselves in every day. This book stresses the power to choose and make good choices with examples of both good and bad. Critics will say it does not display enough diversity but I read that it is about a white family in a white setting, that 's a true situation and there is nothing wrong with that. There is a section where Danny has a lemonade stand in the park where diverse children are portrayed. Perhaps, in the future I would recommend to the authors to make what would ____ do? book with a character of another background/race? Anyways, I ca not wait to read this with my students!  24 book reviews: Our three and a half year old grandson thoroughly enjoyed the booked. The premise of asking a young child to make choices and understand the consequence of those choices is excellent.  One criticism - the organization of the nine stories could have used some editing. Grandpa Steve admits getting lost a couple of times, flipping pages back and forth. Hopefully that has been or will be corrected in subsequent books written by these authors.  Otherwise - BRAVO!  25 book reviews: Wonderfully illustrated and absolutely brilliant in its message. The \"good\" choices the boy can make are a little emotionally repressive for me, preaching excessive compassion for others and none for the self, but overall this book is Standard American Parenting at its best. My six-year-old absolutely loved it. 26 book reviews: I like the concept of this book, but it got really confusing!! The back and forth. It is like a \"choose your own adventure\" but if I got confused, then kids will too. Self Published, obviously... an editor would have worked that out for you! Still liked the pictures and the concept! Even with the guide at the beginning I got confused! 27 book reviews: Danny has choices to make throughout his day. The format of make a decision/choice and turn to those pages helps a reader think about their own choices during the day. The clever part is that readers can go back and make different choices to see how they change Danny 's day. Use to talk about choices we make. 28 book reviews: WONDERFUL! Now, usually social skills books cannot help sounding preachy, even hoity-toity. Not this one. It is a load of fun. I read the stories out loud to first graders as well as fifth graders, and all classes were mesmerized. (I even learned a few good Mom techniques that I plan to try.) Hats off to the authors!! 29 book reviews: I absolutely love this book. It 's a game changer for my family. Few days after I read this book with my 4 years old. He start to think before he act out and start to make better choices. It 's makes mom 's life better for I do not need to battle with him, argue, debate and seeing him throwing tantrum all the time. It make his life better for choosing the right. ",
    " Where the Crawdads Sing": "book reviews: Wow.  Like so many people, I read this book because my book club chose it. Unlike so many people, I am not impressed. Not even a little bit. A lot of times when a book is rated this high, I tend to think it 's me and not the book. But nope. This time I fully believe it 's the book.  This will be ranty and in the order in which things made me want to rant. No apologies.  I should have known things were not going to go well from the title alone. Crayfish are all over the place, but they do not sing in any of those places.*  I definitely knew this was not the book for me on the very first page. I absolutely abhor overwrought prose that reads like the author sat down with the intention of writing the next Great American Novel and therefore had a certain number of adjectives and metaphors to fit on each page to prove their work was worth the accolades it was sure to get with sentences like: \"Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light inits muddy throat. Even night crawlers are diurnal in this lair. There are sounds, of course, but compared to the marsh, the swamp is quiet because decomposition is cellular work. Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.\" There is beautiful imagery, and then there is pretentious cobbling together of SAT words and figurative language so it seems deep but really is not. For me, this was the latter. And so much of the book is just that overly flowery language barfed over every page for no reason, saying nothing or not making a lick of sense with what it does say. But it sounds pretty! So! Art!  Then there was the massive eye-brow raising I did when I discovered this was taking place in North Carolina. The dialect. AGHHHHH!!!! This is why authors should not use dialect when they write. You have to know a place so well in order to do that. Southern hick does not equal southern hick does not equal southern hick. There are (at the very least) five different dialects spoken in North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone. The majority of my professors could tell which region each NC native was from by a couple sentences. I had a few who could get within two counties of where they were born after hearing them speak. Yeah. Kya 's father 's dialect would be exceedingly different from everyone else in their community as he is from the mountains and they are in the Outer Banks. Those are so distinctive and nothing alike. No one else in the world speaks like the Pamlico Sound people of NC. And it is rather hard to capture its cadence and brogue on page so just do not try. You will fail. (Owens totally failed.)  Is that nit-picky? Maybe. But I am more concerned with how the dialect was used. Every \"good\" person in the book overcame their dialect to learn to speak \"proper\" (ugh I hate even typing that word) English. Are you telling me Kya, who did not have TV or radio as influence, lost her dialect with no practice and no outside influence because she was just...smart??? Good???? Same with Tate. But Chase kept his so we knew he was bad and a threat. There 's some classist nonsense imbedded deep in that, and I am not here for it in any way. It 's particularly annoying as it reads the way I imagine people pretend to speak when they are speaking \"southern hick\" to be mockingly superior but have never actually heard a real human in the south speak.**  Then I reached the part on p57 where Kya 's dad says of his family: \"They had land, rich land, raised tobacco and cotton and such. Over near Asheville. Yo' gramma on my side wore bonnets big as wagon wheels and long skirts. We lived in a house wif a verandder that went a'the way around two stories high. It was fine, mighty fine.\" I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband who was born and lived his entire life \"near Asheville\". His response, \"What in the world?\" What in the world indeed. A. No one from western NC talks like this. And Kya 's father did not move to the OBX until he was an adult, so he would still have his home dialect. Any student of language knows you do not shed and switch an accent easily once you are in adulthood. It takes practice. And even then the results are dodgy. Also this is not how Pamlico people speak anyway. See my rant about dialect above. B. Does Owens know Asheville is in the mountains??? (Tobacco was grown in the mountains though not nearly as much or as successfully as in the Piedmont. Cotton is waaaayyy harder. It gets too cold and rains too much. Also there 's just not enough flat, arable land to make it worth the effort. I know there was a cotton mill in Asheville at the time, but I have never heard about people growing the cotton around there. If they were, it had to have failed more than half the time and not because of weevils. It 's just not hot enough long enough. And no one was getting rich off agriculture and building plantation style houses there with slaves as was mentioned later in the book. Western NC was not like the Deep South. Because it is MOUNTAINS. Anyone who has ever driven to Asheville from the Piedmont knows exactly how mountainous. It 's like flat flat flat whoa we are going UP. There 's not enough flat land for plantations.)  Then there was the part where Tate 's mom went to ASHEVILLE for a bike because they did not have it at the local store. Like WHAT??? She did not try Wilmington? She drove past Greenville, Raleigh (the capitol), Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, missed exits to CHARLOTTE (the largest city), to drive up a mountain for a bike? Literally no other city in NC had it? it takes SIX HOURS to drive from the Pamlico Sound to Asheville on a good traffic day in the year of our Lord 2019. Do you know how long it would have been in the 50s???  Good Grief, what is this woman 's obsession with Asheville? And does she believe it is somewhere near the coast rather than on the complete opposite end of a rather long state?  Which is how I knew no matter how smart she sounded or how much she might know about science and wildlife, Delia Owens did not bother to research squat about North Carolina. Or she did and then disregarded it for whatever reason. Maybe she thought the Outer Banks and Asheville as NC 's top tourist destinations were the names she needed to drop to make her book sound authentic???  \\_( )_/   Huge parts of the novel are a giant snooze fest of nature this nature that and here 's some more nature. And also grits. Because this is SOUTHERN y'all. In case it has not been hammered in yet.  There were some freakin' awkward sexual scenes.  Then there were the long drawn out court scenes that were just so tedious.  I gathered from these scenes Owens is also unclear about travel times from the Greenville to the OBX. (Also I m not sure if there ever was a Piedmont Hotel in Greenville, which is in the coastal plain and not the Piedmont. However, there IS one in Waynesville, which is also not in the Piedmont. Waynesville is in the mountains near.....guess where....Asheville.) Someone buy the woman a freakin  map since she clearly doesn t know what Google is.   The working of the town vs Kya also bothered me. It 's like Owens knows that the OBX people are a difficult community to become a part of without truly understanding the whys and hows of it all.  Kya 's character development was just so frustrating overall. And some of the stuff she accomplishes requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief. Owens definitely wanted the reader to see her a certain way. She is a manic pixie dream girl in a marsh until suddenly she is not...   And finally rant-wise, Owens does not seem to know quite what she wants this book to be. Is it an ode to nature? Is it a crime novel? Is it literary fiction? It 's kind of like she wanted to write the crime novel but genre writing is too plebeian, so here comes the overwrought language and navel gazing. Because ART. The nature part was her falling back on what she was comfortable with I think.  *Crayfish do, I learned from my research, make a noise but we do not often hear it as they can make it underwater as well as out of water. It sounds like tap dancing. No singing even remotely flirted with. Where the Crawdads Tap Dance does not have the same ring I guess. And also does not narrow things down geographically. I did wonder why it was not called Where the Cicadas Sing. Because those sing. And are on a 17 year cycle. Which would have fit PERFECTLY with the timeline of the book. So color me confused. I know NC can be overrun with cicadas, but I am not sure if the Pamlico region has them or not. Still would have made more sense than the actual title. (Again, it sounds flowery and important. Does not mean it has depth or meaning.)  **My husband decided at age 13 to get rid of his accent. He worked long and hard at it. He did it by listening to network TV anchors and copying their speech patterns. It took years of concentrated effort. It 's still not completely gone though he can pass for not being southern in other parts of the country. And when he 's home? It comes back full force with all its dialectic eccentricities. I have lived the majority of my life in the Southern Appalachian mountains. Everyone here still knows I am an outsider the second I open my mouth despite the fact my midwestern relatives swear up and down I have an accent now. And people here in eastern Tennessee are uncertain about my husband because he sounds kind of like them but not quite. (He 's let his accent come back more since settling here because it helps with the not being considered an outsider. That 's as important in southern Appalachia as it is in the OBX if you want to be embraced by the community.) But a single gorge changed the dialect between eastern TN Appalachian and western NC Appalachian just enough natives here recognize his accent as being not quite theirs. BY THE WAY my husband was just as smart after training out his accent as he was when he had it at its thickest. He knew he needed it gone to be a journalist, so he got rid of it. He was literally asked to \"speak southern\" by people in Michigan when we lived there briefly more than once so they could laugh about it. Which is f***ed up. Southerners speak the way they do for cultural and geographical reasons and it has nothing to do with the amount of intelligence or righteousness they have. 1 book reviews: 9/8/20 note: Dear Goodreaders, If you loved this book, I am very happy for you. As a reader and also somebody who works in the publishing industry, I want all readers to like or love as many books as possible, so the fact that you love this book is, in my opinion, a good thing. If reading a review that does not agree with your opinion enrages you, do not read this review. I do not believe there are spoilers in my opinion, but a couple of commenters think there are. So if you have not yet read this book, you may not want to read my review. I read it quite a while ago and have moved on to many more books that I am more interested in. So I wo not be joining conversation in the comments. If you disliked this book, you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy Robinson    Normally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I ve decided to say what I think:  I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).  The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids  scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of , where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:     Why not just,  I m hungry,  and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime?  In real life, people do not say everything they re thinking or narrate everything that s happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.  I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.  I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya s character.  Sorry, friends who adore this book, I m an outlier on this one, I guess. 2 book reviews: Seeing as to how I skipped most of the second half of the book, I have no choice but to give it one star.  There are so many things wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The only thing it really had going for it was the plot, which was definitely a good one, and it is too bad that it got wrecked.  I am at a loss to put this book into any kind of genre. Romance? YA? Courtroom drama? Murder mystery? I rather suspect that the author had the idea, first and foremost, to weave a story around how human behavior imitates that of wildlife, was fascinated by the marsh area of NC and fashioned a story around this. As a result the book neither flies nor swims. We might, on one page, get a lot of scientific information about insects, birds and plants, then we are back to the romance style of  her cheeks burned,   her groin throbbed as if all her blood had surged there.   her long hair trailing in the wind  and  he reached out and ran his fingers across her firm breasts.  Did I mention that she had black hair and red lips? And that she spontaneously recites poetry out loud on the beach?  Some books have unlikely coincidences, some have downright contrived ones and others have those that are highly unlikely and therefore plain unbelievable. In the first and second cases, a book can still make it if the characterisations, settings and plot are well done. In the third case, unless you are talking about a fairy tale, you have to be either really romantically minded or you just go along with whatever for the sake of entertainment.  Crawdads  falls into the third category.  It is rather unbelievable that, even with an abusive and alcoholic father, the rest of the family would simply abandon their six-year old daughter and sister, unless they were totally depraved, which the author portrays them as not. It is unbelievable that not one single adult in the nearby town would know that the girl was in the marsh by herself and thus make some effort to help her. I will put the rest of the  unbelievables  at the bottom in a spoiler alert. Aside from them, there are the errors and other annoying facets.  Such as the author s use of the vernacular, but only for the bad folks. The good folks all speak proper English. Such as the author s fascination with southern food, especially grits, black-eyed peas and turnip greens, which are mentioned ad-nauseum.  Spoiler alert: Unbelievable that the girl, who did not learn to read until age 14, would then go on to become a self-educated scientist and artist and even write several books, all while being entirely on her own in the wilds. It is unbelievable, since she wasn t that far from town, that she would never seek out any contact with anyone besides her two suitors and an old black couple. Especially since she was a  looker  and wore white cut-off jeans (really??) when she went to town to buy groceries. How could everyone be so mean to her unless she was plain weird (which we are assured she was not). No, it was that all the town s people were just narrow-minded and mean except for of course the one golden boy with the golden locks. 3 book reviews: All the Stars!!!!!  Can I just say that I loved everything about this book and leave it at that!?!  Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of resiliency, survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, desperation, prejudice, determination and strength. This book goes back and forth in time to tell the story of Kya Clark a.k.a. the Marsh girl. She lives on the outskirts of town, in the Marsh, and the locals look down their noses at her, she is judged, ridiculed and bullied. But there are those who show her kindness, friendship, and show her love. Oh, how I loved this book!  Kya was a young girl when her Mother walked away without looking back. Soon, all her siblings followed suit, leaving Kya alone with her often absent, drunk, and abusive father. She is left to care for their home, to cook, clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop, to cook and to provide food for herself in her father 's absence. All while dealing with loneliness, feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return. She was a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs. Soon 'Jumpin and his wife, Mable, show her kindness, generosity and love. I dare you not to adore this couple!  As Kya grows and learns more about life through her interactions with the creatures of the Marsh, two young men enter her life. One is her brother 's older friend, Tate, who teaches her to read and shows her acceptance and happiness. Another brings her hope of a future but won t introduce her to his friends and family. Could one be her chance at happiness? A chance at belonging? A chance at being accepted? A chance at being loved? A Chance for growth? Or will history repeat itself?  In 1969, local football legend, Chase Andrews is found dead. Rumors swirl as to motive and possible suspects. Rumors have been circulating for years about Chase and his involvement with the Marsh girl. Could she be his killer? What motive could she have?  This book had a little bit of everything that I love: a likeable main character who pulls at your heartstrings, murder mystery, atmosphere, drama, coming of age, and romance. There are several characters who give and show kindness including, Tate, the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give, give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.  This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh. I highly recommend this book! It 's thoughtful, evokes emotion, and transports the reader back in time to the Marsh. I loved every page.  Read more of my reviews at 4 book reviews: *5 Stars, easily!*  WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a gentle yet symbolic depiction of the valiant survival of Kya Clark a reclusive young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, school system, the entire town surrounding her, and what ultimately feels like life itself.  has quite literally become caretaker, and deep in a lonely Marsh along the North Carolina coast is where Kya will not only hide, but blossom into a primal independent being, coaxed inside the embrace of an indiscriminate wilderness as she embodies its uninhibited spirit.  Until a boy from  yonder  befriends Kya, and her lonely existence is shaken straight to its solemn core. Add to that the curious unsolved murder of the town s local  Golden Boy , and all that s left to say is game-on.  Although this story delivers one hell of a powerful punch, it is sculpted with a humble hand; a delicate wind that keeps building and building until it ends up emphatically blowing your mind.  The writing. Is. Beautiful. Prose so unique and so breathtaking that a single description of a suddenly grows so intimate and probing, and I might have gotten something in my eye **.  Here you ll find sentences that read like poetry, with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy nor over-the-top --- but pretty .  does not tell us what to think, but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense, atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine, all on our own.  She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya, and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love.  Kya s journey spans years, the reader present from her childhood into maturity. I love this story s ode to wilderness and Mother Earth with her instinctual need to nurture and protect. I love each character s flawed nature as well as those redeemed. I love the heart and soul that saturates every inch of this story, and more than anything, I that spectacularly bold ending!  To the reader who appreciates nature s effortless beauty honored in fiction; to those who seek a love story every bit true as it is tender; to the one who needs a tantalizing murder/mystery to spice things up, and for those who tend to root for the underdog in hopes she ll someday sparkle like the gem she is this one s for . 5 book reviews: Phew, I finally made it through this book! My apologies to everyone who loved this, but unfortunately, I did not, and no one 's sadder than me.  Reading Where the Crawdads Sing was like stepping back in time to high school, when class-assigned books meant lots of award-winning fiction. Sure, there were plenty of literary merit found in these pages, but little joy was actually experienced from reading them.  Starting at the age of six, Kya was slowly abandoned by everyone in her family, until she was the sole person left living in a little shack at the edge of town. As the years went by, shunned by the entire town, she slowly became known as the \"Marsh Girl,\" a wild and lonely creature that few knew and most feared. This is her story. And when the town 's golden boy dies, old prejudices flair up, and Kya finds herself at the receiving end of the town 's anger and suspicion.  This story is descriptive prose at its most verbose, and no detail the marsh, waterways, bugs, trees, animals, and sea shells was too small to be included. But the story has little plot and even less character development. Especially in the beginning, when Kya did not talk to or interact with a single person, the monotony of the writing almost did me in.  The other big issue is that the story is pretty hard to believe. We are supposed to accept that Kya is able to fend for herself, which includes cooking, cleaning, going to the store, buying things, and coming up with ways to make money, all at the age of six. That is way beyond the realm of possibility, let alone probability. There 's only so far my beliefs can be suspended, I tell you.  That 's not to say I did not enjoy a single thing here because I did. I found the middle of the book to be the most engaging. That was when Kya started interacting with others and the writing became a little bit more interesting as a result. Tate and Jumpin' were my favorite characters, and every scene they were in grabbed me. But the juxtaposition of their scenes (alive and compelling) against the ones without them (descriptive and unchanging) made the latter feel even more dull and plodding by comparison.  In the end, this book just is not for me. Everything that others loved are all the same things I did not. I prefer my books to have interesting plot advancement, nuanced character growth, and zippy writing, none of which this book had. Instead, the plot is straightforward, the characters all remain stubbornly the same throughout, and the writing is long-winded enough to deflate even the most enthusiastic of readers.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~       6 book reviews: All of you talked me into reading this book. The Goodreads reviews were virtually unanimously good, not just good, great. It had to be good, I thought. And because I needed an extra audiobook I bought it on Libro.fm and locked myself into reading it. Bad decision.  This book is just a pile of tropes and cliches dressed up in some nice nature writing. The plot is not much of a plot and the mystery makes up only a small section of the book, and much of it ends up being courtroom scenes and not much mystery. This book is basically Manic Pixie Dream Girl In the Marsh. We spend a long time with young Kya, abandoned, fending for herself, almost entirely isolated. I was willing to be patient through all that, to see what kind of person she would grow into because that had the potential to be very interesting.  Except it was not. It became less interesting the longer I read. Because Kya does not act like a person who has been almost entirely isolated. She just acts like a regular loner. Sure, she may have some habits that fit with her strange upbringing, but she seems to understand people and language just like a regular person. I was nearly out of my head with frustration that the book had spent so long telling me how different she was only to have her be just the same as most people. (Deciding to never love again because everyone leaves you is a pretty regular-person thing to do when you are in your 20 's, for example.)  This is not a book of deep psychological insight. You can probably guess from a couple of chapters in how it will end. (And you would be right!) There are no real revelations, the plot is pretty obvious ahead of time. And it 's all rather confusing because there are sections where Owens writes well, her courtroom scenes are actually quite competent, but on both the broad strokes and the specific details nothing here really rings true. And the more time that passed the more I got annoyed with this book so it finally fell from 3-stars to a rare 2-star review. (I usually quit a 2-star book.) If you are going to give me a plot I have seen a thousand times, at least wrap it in some keen insight or character development. But sadly this was a failure for me all around. 7 book reviews: I seem to be finding myself in the minority a lot these days. The first half of this book was pretty close to marvelous, and then it went south on me (that is a pun). Anyway, after my attempt at weak humor, let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.  Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted, albeit gradually, by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment, which would be a necessity to survive in such a place, and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company, she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.  That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive, whether she would connect with the outside world, and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then, in what seemed an abrupt change of tone, the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.  I am sorry this didn t work for me. I wanted it to, indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read, I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.  I had originally rated this a 3-star read, but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only \"OK\" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars. I think I felt shy of giving it only 2 when so many of my respected friends had given it 5...but truth should prevail. 8 book reviews: You know that person? The one who does not like what everyone else seems to love? There has to be someone in the outlier club and this time it is me. I was highly anticipating this book after reading all the praise from readers whose tastes usually align with my own. Unfortunately, I should have DNF would this one when very early in the book, my eyes glazed over and I began skimming pages and pages of descriptive writing. The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don t care for overly descriptive writing. And then there 's poetry. I skipped over those as well.  Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I wo not list them all, but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn t get past.  To make things worse, romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it.  Finally, I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.  Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I do not like. This was not one of those times.  Recommended for readers who enjoy long, descriptive nature writing, and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief. If I had known these things before starting this book I would have skipped it, so perhaps my review will help other readers like me.  * Thanks to Edelweiss for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review 9 book reviews: a reread before the movie comes out because, for once, a film adaptation looks amazing and i actually want to see it.  ______________________  there are currently 582 people waiting for this book at my library. at first i thought that notification was a glitch; but then i read this, this impossibly tender story, and now im shocked as to why the waitlist isnt twice that.  there is a reason this book has become so sought after, and it feels like a privilege to have experienced it. this is one of the most memorable coming-of-age stories i have read in quite some time. it is a story that proves the growth of a person and the cultivation of nature are not mutually exclusive. this book is a celebration of all life, human and mother earth alike.  there is a very special connection between kya and the environment which raised her. the elegant prose and lyrical depictions of the marshlands are so beautifully comforting, guiding the reader through kyas world, just as it guided her throughout life. i cannot describe what an intimate feeling it is, to see the world through kyas eyes. its so enlightening to see someone comprehend that even though there is a harshness to surviving, there is also immense wonder and beauty.  this story is as touching as it is inspiring. and i now have a very strong desire to take an evening walk, look at the stars, and just marvel at the world in which i live. 10 book reviews:   4.53 across 160,000 ratings on Goodreads.   400+ holds at my library (I actually had to buy this).   #1 on the Amazon charts.   On virtually every Book Club 's reading list.  ...and I can t finish it.  I m sorry. I do realise with those numbers it is definitely me. I read all of Part 1 and the first chapter of Part 2, then I gave up at page 156. Nothing seemed to be happening other than Kya fishing and cooking grits. There are lots of pretty nature metaphors like:  But I just don t enjoy descriptions of trees, swamps and bugs that much.  It 's funny. Usually when a book does not float my boat, I can still totally understand the hype. I would not have called this one, though, I must admit.  | | | | 11 book reviews: I really enjoyed the parts of this book that were related to the marsh and the natural world, but the story itself did not wow me. I am definitely in the minority here - many glowing reviews, but it had a  women s literature  flavor to me that I don t personally care for.  A nice fiction debut for Owens; just not my cuppa.  Interesting Atlantic Monthly article about Delia Owens being wanted for questioning about a murder in Zambia. It s amazing it took so long for this story to come out, based on the high profile of this book. Fair warning, there are spoilers about this book in the article: 12 book reviews: I am typically skeptical of books that are hyped to high heavens and end up on every book club list for months straight, not because they are not worthy, but because I can let my expectations get the best of me and keep me from fully enjoying a wonderful book. This book exceeded my already high expectations; it emanates a quiet power, a slow drawing in and connection of reader to book, one that I found myself able to get lost in due to the lush atmosphere and the depth of emotion. I can see now why this book is getting so much attention, and am thrilled to see that for once the hype train was right on track. 13 book reviews: I envied Kya s mother for walking out of this book on page 6 and not having to suffer through the rest of it like I did. 14 book reviews: if i see one more person rate and recommend this book im gonna cry esp recently LIKE YALL KNOW THIS AUTHOR IS COMPLICIT IN A MURDER RIGHT???????? 15 book reviews: 4.5 stars rounded up . A story of survival, of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother, then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father, because of his meanness, his abuse, his drinking. What she doesn t understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned, remembering the beatings, trying to figure out a way to eat.  Atmospheric is an understatement, and I don t use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place, the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya s realization  And the marsh became her mother.  The marsh becomes her life, her livelihood, the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds, her art. But is it enough to heal her? The kind hearts of Jumpin  and Mabel who help a little girl alone and in need, the only human contact she has until her brother s friend Tate comes into her life, but is that enough to help her heal ? I love the writing, fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants, the insects, the fish, the birds which pique Kya s curiosity, give her so much joy and company, and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?  There s a murder mystery, not my usual fare, but I was totally engaged, trying to come up with who the murderer was, totally engaged in the courtroom scenes. I gave it 4.5 stars because there were a couple of things that felt not quite realistic. But when I woke up thinking about this story, I knew I would round it up to 5 stars . I don t often cry over books, but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read, heartbreaking in so many ways, with wonderful writing and characters, a stunning portrait of a place, of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya, a character to remember. An unforgettable ending.  This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together. In this case, we have very similar feelings about this beautiful story.  I received an advanced copy of this book from G.P. Putnam s Sons through Edelweiss. 16 book reviews: I ca not even imagine how this book has a 4+ star rating. The characters, including the protagonist, are so simplistic as to be unbelievable. The plot is trite. The dialog is atrocious...and offensive. A girl who basically raises herself in a swamp speaks perfect King 's English while every black character \"goes 'round speakin' like they done did grow up in dat dar barn.\" I am 50 pages from the end, and I refuse to waste another minute reading this. Also, I usually put the books I finish in my Little Free Library, but I am throwing this one in the recycling bin. 17 book reviews: Check out the most unique video review of this book! https://youtu.be/fKemigtrvvs  This book centers on a young girl named Kya who lives alone in the North Carolina marsh. The author who is well versed in non-fiction and has a strong background in nature has beautiful prose and really captures the essence of nature in her writing. Over the course of her life, Kya forms certain connections particularly with two young men from town.  When Chase Andrews, a young man from town, is found dead, Kya is a suspect. Did she do it? What happened?  This book goes into so many different topics: class, how you can really \"help\" someone, judging someone else, what real love is, what family is, the beauty of relationships and connection.  In many ways, this book is relatable. Most people have felt like an outsider at some point in their lives. In this book, Kya was very lucky to find some people who actually cared about her. Also, the author talks about this fear that Kya felt. This is normal. Women are normally afraid unfortunately. Always looking over our shoulder. Always told to not go out at night. Always travel with someone. If anything, I think this book is a good reminder that some things have not changed in 50 years. Women are still beat by men, and even if they do go through the law, it does not always work out. This book.....Wow! It definitely deserved all of the buzz. That being said, I did NOT like the last 2 pages of the book. I thought that the ending should have been more open.  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities 18 book reviews: 4.25 To by o naprawd  dobre.

Starts out OK though from the beginning you have to suspend logic to go along with the plot; by midpoint it falls apart into a series of cliched, trite, unsupported, silly plot points. The character development, so-called, is frankly unbelievable and downright ridiculous. I m giving it an extra star because in the age of Trump I m trying to be kinder in general.  No. Just no. 20 book reviews: I have been wanting to read this book for months!!  I keep seeing amazing reviews, there are literally 250,000+ ratings so far on here...  I should finally have my hands on it within the month according to my library waiting list (I was #200 and something... FINALLY!!) 21 book reviews: Among my Goodread friends, I sit in the camp of believing this was a superb book and a very easy 5 stars for me. Why? because this was a wonderful tale that had everything; from the imagery, sentiment, character appeal, and themes that were interwoven into a story so perfectly that nothing appeared overworked but all of it caught me in 'the feelers'. But most of all it had a child 's / woman 's determination at the centre of the story. My heart was invested.  Is it a stunning piece of literature, well no it is not? Is the writing style to everyone s taste, well no to that as well? I can empathise with readers who could not connect with the dialogue particularly at the beginning. I could not get my tongue around some of the slang in the opening chapters but then it softens as the book progresses. Was it plausible for a young girl to live in the marshes   perhaps no to that as well?  However, could I connect with a story of hardship, isolation, courage, endurance, and overcoming prejudices, then yes, I could. I love the stories of drive, strength, accomplishment and determination, despite the odds, and this book has it in abundance. A beautiful story told with so much heart.  The Plot  Kya is a Marsh girl, deserted by her mother and left to a drunk and violent father, who eventually abandons her along with all her other siblings. She was not school educated, and so she begins to learn her lessons in life through nature, the wildness surrounding her and with a little help from her friend Tate. Possessing an irrepressibly curious mind Kya finds a dizzying array of new ways to live and learn through nature, she learns to love and cope with disappointment. She learns trade, life skills, and even to read and write but above all she learns to depend only on herself.  What is beautiful about this story is the journey of Kya into adulthood as she learns to trust only to be disappointed, but the coming of age was handled with such delicacy and sensitivity that I can only applaud the author.  I loved that Kya was not someone who would indulge in the softer emotions of self-pity and disappointment but accepted her earlier demise and went about changing it. At the end of the book we see the poor  amarsh girl' replaced with something wonderfully unique but still true to her inner values. A girl who did not need to wear fancy dresses and depend on social acceptance to define her - because it was the torn clothes, years of rejection, isolation, and abuse that she would go on to wear as badges of courage and of survival.  The sensory descriptions, the beautifully described landscape, the character development through the book and the storyline made this a 5-star read for me.  The simplicity of this story was its beauty, Kay s isolation and growth was its crowning glory and so the Crawdad 's Sing!!!! 22 book reviews: At the time of reading, this book seems to be the most hyped book in my Goodreads feed. Not a minute goes by without a review or update from this book popping up. If you know me, you know that no matter the type of book or the subject matter, if it is hyped I want to give it a go. With that in mind, when I started this, the only thing I knew about it was its hype   I knew zero about the story, genre, type of book, etc. I just had a cover and a title!    I think it did. I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that  heart-strings were pulled , and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good, well-told story you will like this one.    Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot. I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But, there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger. Also, while only a little steamy at times, I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again, if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance, you will not find it here, but the relationships in the story should be of interest.    I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this, I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So, if you have seen the hype in your feed, too, and have been wondering, I think you should try it out. You may not be blown away, but I don t think you will be disappointed. 23 book reviews: There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot. Kya Clark - the Marsh Girl - led a lonely life.  Her mother left her, her siblings left her, her father went out and never came home. The townspeople abhorred her and left her well-alone.  But when you are only a child yourself, And so Kya learns to love and live by herself. And as she grew, . Since she could read and write, and she had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, she did the only logical thing - But then, Chase Andrews, winds up dead. Kya Clark, now an adult, is the prime suspect.  Just when her life was finally picking up,  Whew. Guys. Girls. People of all ages.  This one was . Like absolutely *stunning*.  I do not even know where to begin - there was so much to love about this book.  The setting was absolutely magical - every time we talked about the swamp and the life within it, I was absolutely riveted to the book.  Kya was such - I felt for her so much and I wanted to just wrap her up in a hug the whole time.  Kya 's first love was so beautifully done - I literally had the hug-the-book-to-yourself-and-squeal moment when they found each other.  I also have now developed an addition to nature-themed books thanks to this gorgeous one.  In short - there 's a to love about this book and youto read it as soon as possible.  This one was absolutely stunning. I just. It 's wonderful.  | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads 24 book reviews: This starts out as a wonderful book well worth a five-start rating. The voice of the coming of age Kya is truly amazing. Had the craft been sustained through to the end of the book this could have easily been compared to, To Kill a Mocking Bird. The setting is marvelous and carries the same weight as a main character. Absolutely wonderful descriptions. The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya, with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder. The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully, the sheriff, not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down. The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful, and done so well it was practically invisible. The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book, however when handling the mystery part of the story, the protagonist doesn t dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times, and long after the crime has occurred, comes forward and says,  Oh, I might have seen something that night. I just didn t think it was important.  For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided. The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form. I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn t buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book, the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character, too many points of view. And the use of clich s like  I walked into a door,  and  I jus  didn t fall off a turnip truck.  didn t match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned, or more likely was rushed. The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided), and that there really wasn t any other possibility, no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn t twist at the end. I wasn t surprised at all. So reluctantly I have to give this one four stars instead of a five plus. David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series 25 book reviews: 4.5 stars 26 book reviews: MEMORABLE CHARACTERS AND MEMORABLE STORY. For me to rate a book five stars it has to give me something bout of the ordinary, make me feel. Most of all it has to be a book or contain a character or characters that I wo not forget. Above all it has to make me feel. This book did all three. Kya, aka Catherine Clark, the Marsh girl is an unforgettable character, abandoned by her mother at she six, her siblings shortly after. By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself, her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh, the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart, curious, feArless and so lonely. As if this character was not enough to remember, there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel, a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate, who has known her since she was small, teaches her to read anc much more.  What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out, trust? Prejudice is a big theme, because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate, unclean, and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian, who claims to love her, but marries another, breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in, a story told in alternate chapters, as when he is murdered , she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in, a man, 74 years old, a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.  I could nitpick a few things, but I wo not. I loved and learned much about the natural world, a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily would not. A survival story, what Kya has to do it not easy, but since she has little choice it is what she does. Making the most of what one has, regardless of how little. More than one I had tears running down my face, so this gets five, big marshmallow stars from this reader.  This was mine, Angela and Esils August read, and as always our reads and discussions are something in which I look forward.  ARC from Edelweiss. 27 book reviews: This was such a GOOD book, am at a loss for words    Having seen the movie already, I thought it would dull my reading experience down a tad bit if only, I loved it more. Kya has my heart, she is such a vibrant and strong character. Her struggles with life kind of resonated in some places. The way she took care of herself with no one around and even when people came and betrayed her trust, she never lost herself. She made mistakes, but she learned.  Chase was honestly, the worst thing to happen. Tate although imperfect was better than Chase. These two guys make and break Kya but I never really cared about the guys as much as I did for her. Sure, there were some sweet moments but was not really impactful for me. I liked Jumpin' and Mabel wayyyyy more.  The marsh descriptions were vivid and well written. I was fully immersed in it tbh and did not really want to put this book down. The legal aspect was interesting to read. I knew how it all ends and I still found it to be satisfying.  if you are looking for a story that revolves around a character and her journey. It 's a coming of age story with murder mystery aspect.    ~ ~ ~ Have I seen the movie? Yes Am I still going to read it? Also yes 28 book reviews: I can t get over how perfect this book is. The writing grabbed me from literally the first page and kept me entranced. And the story! How can your heart not help but ache for Kya? First her mother leaves, then her siblings, even her ne er do well father. Left to her own devices by the entire town, she survives without schooling or any aid. The preacher s wife calls her white trash and hurries her child away from Kya convinced she carries disease.  The marsh is a character in its own right. Owens does a magnificent job describing it so that we feel we are there, seeing every plant, bird and insect along with Kya. Owens paints the surroundings just like Kya paints, with a fine brush intent on getting every detail right.  There are so many heartbreaking moments in this book. Kya just can t understand why everyone leaves her. The murder mystery was very well done and I had no clue how it would play out. The suspense was killing me.  So, this is my first five star book of 2019. It has everything - beautiful writing, great characters and suspense. Highly recommend it! 29 book reviews: Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is a 2018 G.P. Putnam 's Sons publication. One part mystery, one part legal drama, one part coming of age story, and one part love story- equals a full heartrending poignant tale that will leave you gasping for air.  Barkley Cove, North Carolina- 1969  Kya Clark- aka-  The Marsh Girl  has been abandoned, one by one, by every single person in her life. She lives by the seat of her pants, in a shack, eluding everyone, except a friend of her brother s named, Tate.  Tate watches out for Kya, when he s able, and teaches her to read, among other things. As time moves on, however, despite a deepening affection for Kya, Tate knows he will have to leave, and go away to college.  While he 's away, the myth of  The Marsh Girl  will solidify forevermore. Kya will face a challenge like no other, and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove, with folks who have taunted her, shunned her, and judged her, her entire life.  In 2016-17, there were several stellar novels written, which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent,  off the grid  environment, living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable, or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective, I wasn t sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme.  Yet, with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers, I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So, obviously, I succumbed, and checked it out of the library.  I never doubted the book would be a good one, I just didn t know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect.  But as it turns out, this story isn t really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing, or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape, as I had originally thought.  While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence, this is also a very tender coming of age tale, a story of survival, but also a story of real friendship, true love, and what it means to truly feel free.  Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak, even from unexpected sources, but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But, all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh, and Kya s life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight.  The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations, especially with Kya s character study, is another area in which the book excels.  There are layers of thought -provoking topics, and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out, but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction, this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However, you should allow yourself to go along with it, because that is part of the beauty of fiction, and it is well worth any required suspension of belief.  Ultimately, I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be, but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama, I enjoyed the trial scenes, and the mystery elements, but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain. 4 stars ",
    " White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism": "book reviews: Half a century after the Civil Rights movement, vast disparities exist between blacks and whites in America. First and foremost, these group inequalities are caused by deep, historical trauma created by white racism and racist policies aimed against black persons and black culture. If slavery and Jim Crow caused a gaping wound, Civil Rights stitched it up; but underneath the wound still festers. How does this wound   the entrenched inequities between blacks and whites in America   continue to exist?  Does the answer to that question exist? I have read and heard a variety of black thinkers try to answer it as they look through different windows upon the situation. They have examined welfare, affirmative action, the black cultural prohibition against  acting white  and being studious, the victim mentality, the war on drugs, the  prison industrial complex,  school inequality, voter suppression, police brutality, and gun violence. All of these current realities take place in a nation in which blacks overall have much less wealth than whites because of the historical legacies of racist policies that forced blacks off any road to financial success.  Any one of these situations is dizzyingly complex. Functioning together, they (and no doubt other factors) produce this vast reality that we call racial inequity. There is no way that any one person can understand it all. It is a mountain of pain, tragedy, and injustice. Overwhelmed, one seeks a way to go forth in one s thinking, one or two foundational principles that will allow one to help ameliorate the situation, or at least not make it worse.  Enter Robin DiAngelo. is an explanation of Robin DiAngelo s invention of the same name, an idea that seeks to explain why it is  so difficult to have conversations about race with white people,  in hopes that examining this will get whites to the point where they can do their part to dismantle systemic racism.  Her book stinks.  Never mind that is based entirely on anecdotal evidence (DiAngelo s own experiences and that of her African-American acquaintances), vast & false assumptions, stunningly faulty reasoning, zero-sum/us-and-them thinking, purely ideological (almost religious) zealotry, and laughably contradictory strictures.* Never mind that DiAngelo seems to believe that guilt-ridden navel-gazing is an effective tool for change. Never mind that she speaks for all people of color, saying that racism is a personal scourge  24/7  (they don t all believe that). Never mind that she is the white savior extraordinaire, who views all black people as victims always, and only whites as powerful agents. Never mind that she encourages whites to patronize blacks in daily interaction, humoring them with mea culpas, and never arguing as equals, never challenging. Never mind that she hopes to combat racism using racist tools   racial stereotyping and racial prejudice. Never mind that she decries bad/good dualism (racist   bad, nonracist   good) even as she all-unwittingly pushes her own bad/good dualism (fragility   bad, stamina   good). And just don t even bother being annoyed, frustrated, or aghast at the way she scorns the human emotions of white people   she and all her white friends will only call you  fragile  and laugh that their circular reasoning was proven right.  Never mind all that. The main reason this book stinks is that it focuses the attention on the wrong problem, one that has very little evidence to support its effects. The problem that DiAngelo sees as the fount of all modern black misery is modern white racism. Careful, though   she does not use the dictionary definition of racism, which is a belief in one s own racial superiority and hostility towards people of other colors and races   what we can also call racial animus. Racism, according to DiAngelo and her ilk, is this mysterious essence, this inner miasma, that inhabits every white person (and no one else). The everyday interactions between whites and blacks, soaked with this inherent bias, is what produces the inequities we see. Racism and whiteness are identical in her book.  So   the fatherless African American family? If we are to believe Robin DiAngelo, it s caused by your shadow thoughts, white people. The much poorer health outcomes for blacks on average? That s on you, O guilty one. The fact that homicide is the #1 killer of young black men? You guessed it: it s all to do with your secret  knowledge  that your life is better the way things are. The fact that those homicide victims are being killed by other young black men? You are a racist for even bringing up that fact. Don t worry, though: all white people are racist. Just admit it, and all problems will be solved.  I don t know what to think about the fact that is a bestseller with so many glowing reviews. I guess unfettered ideology is attractive. I m very, very sorry that anyone believes what Robin DiAngelo says. People, please, I beg you: If you want to make the world a better place, study policy. Understand that it is very complex and full of unintended consequences. Examine data, question assumptions. Don t take this stuff on faith; it s too important. Challenge both liberal and conservative racial orthodoxy. Think past the labels   treat yourself and others as human beings and individuals. Regard yourself and all others as agents   agents of personal and political change, agents of compassion and empathy.  Please don t waste your time on the racial prejudices and double standards of identity-zealots like Robin DiAngelo.    * Examples of contradictory strictures: White people must be vulnerable. White people must not show their feelings. White people must not become silent. White people should be silent. White people must not leave the room when they re upset. White people must leave the room when they re upset.  1 book reviews: I began reading this book with the assumption that I would get a better understanding of why it 's so hard to talk to other white people about race. Maybe there would be a couple things I needed to be aware of in myself, but all in all, this would be a book about other white people.  Well! Damn if I was not wrong! Right in the beginning, Robin DiAngelo knocked me off of my why-I am-not-racist pedestal. She called me out in the very beginning by suggesting that I the reader was probably sitting there thinking of all the ways I am not racist. Down I went.  How predictable we white people are, even when we think we are not. Even when we are certain we are not racist. Even when we think we are different from other white people. How predictable am. In order to get anywhere with racism, we first need to be willing to look at all the ways we (each white person) uphold and perpetuate racism. My sitting there reassuring myself that I am an exception and these x, y, z are the reasons to prove I am not, all but ascertained that I was not going to learn anything, or enough, from this book. I am so grateful that Ms. DiAngelo began this way.  Did it make me uncomfortable? Hell, yeh, it did. Believe me, I was sitting there squirming, biting my lower lip, and almost wanting to just not read the book at all. However, I knew that the fact that it made me uncomfortable was the biggest reason I needed to read this book. Not so I could get insight into other white people, but to get insight into . To point out flaws and uncover the ways racism manifests itself through my words and actions.  Robin DiAngelo begins by explaining exactly what racism is and why it is that most white people are so afraid of being seen as racist. Explains why we put all our energy into \"proving\" we are not. I found the definitions she used to be incredibly helpful:   \" is pre-judgment.\"   \" is action based on prejudice.\"    \"is a far-reaching system that functions independently from the intentions or self-images of individual actors.\" It develops \"when a racial group s collective prejudice is backed by the power of legal authority and institutional control\".   \" is a manifestation of racism that well-intentioned people who see themselves as educated and progressive are more likely to exhibit.\"   Confusing these terms and thinking that racism is only an intentional act of discrimination leads us to believe that we are exempt from racism, we are not racist, and thus ensures that we will do nothing to change. It \"protects our biases, because denying that we have them ensures that we won t examine or change them.\"  Every aspect of Western culture is based on white superiority. It is backed by authority and institutional control (I would say especially so in the United States). When racism and racist thought are rooted so deeply into our culture, it is \"the norm rather than an aberration.  Feedback is key to our ability to recognize and repair our inevitable and often unaware collusion.\" We are conditioned into racism and a white supremacist worldview. Thus, rather than focusing our energy into convincing ourselves and others that we are not racist, we need to focus that energy on confronting our own racist tendencies and ideas. As Ms. DiAngelo points out, \"We do have them, and people of color already know we have them; our efforts to prove otherwise are not convincing.\"  I think this is an incredibly important book. Though it is very basic and rudimentary and repetitive at times, this book is a crucial starting point. It demands we look honestly at ourselves. If we are against racism and truly want change, we have to first start with ourselves. I cannot change my behaviour or thoughts if I am certain I am without blame. How then can I hope to change an entire system? I need to be open to criticism without becoming defensive. Is it comfortable to do so? Nope, absolutely not. But I can deal with a bit of discomfort, especially in light of all the pain that people of colour have endured and still endure. It is imperative that I honestly examine myself; it is not going to kill me -- but racism kill people of colour.  White fragility functions to\"keep people of color from challenging racism in order to avoid white wrath. In turn, not challenging white people on racism upholds the racial order and whites  position within that order.\"  I implore all white people to read this book, even if you are certain you are not racist. if you are certain you are not racist. Let 's all work on changing ourselves and then perhaps much-needed change can take place in our society and in our judicial systems. It is our responsibility to be less fragile and to finally listen to people of colour and be open to examining our flaws and biases. There is so much more I could write about, including the things I discovered about myself reading this book, but instead I will finally end this lengthy review and encourage you to read the book. And after that, read books by people of color. Only by listening to those who are on the receiving end of racism can we bring about effective change.   2 book reviews: Skip this book entirely and read Caste by Isabel Wilkerson. It covers much of the same info and is considerably better researched. ****Edited to add: If the above statement bothers you I do not care so please stop commenting on it, thanks:)  This book is written by a white person for other whites. Most of what she writes is common sense but no doubt useful for white folks struggling to not feel attacked when racism is discussed.  I was annoyed at a remark about 21% in where the author points out that she is not a fan of Black history month or Black firsts. The authors direct quote is \"'I am not against Black History Month. But it should be celebrated in a way that doesn t reinforce whiteness. & The subtext is that Robinson finally had what it took to play with whites, as if no black athlete before him was strong enough to compete at that level. Imagine if instead, the story went something like this:  Jackie Robinson, the first black man whites allowed to play major-league baseball.   This implies that Black History Month reinforces whiteness which is a bullshit claim. What this demonstrates is that the author does not understand Black History month and furthermore does not understand that white people are not ever under any circumstances ever entitled to an opinion on Black Culture or Community.  Her criticism on what black folks create for themselves is irrelevant, racially insensitive and out of pocket. I agree with her that Black firsts should be presented as finally white people stop being so racist and let this Black person participate. I would argue with her that 's what Black folk already understand to be the context. Since Black History month is for us, white folks misconstruing or misunderstanding the context is not important. Which is why the author should not offer white opinions on what Black folks create to celebrate themselves, it has no white context. So if you are not Black you wo not get it and you do not need to. It 's not for you. Stay in your fucking lane.  Edited to add: If you are white and the previous paragraph about the authors opinion on 'Black firsts' bothers you please do not comment on it; I did not misunderstand the author, I do not care if that bit was particularly helpful to you, please do not comment with the exact quote to tell me I misread it. All of those responses are expressions of your own white fragility. If you want to see how I respond to such questions, do read the comment section as I have replied to this repeatedly.  Edited Oct 28, 2020 to add: Because this is such a popular issue with folks who read this review I took the time to engage with a white person fully on this issue, Heather. That exchange starts on Oct 24, 2020. If you are interested in how I feel, why I respond this way, any further thoughts read my exchange with Heather. It goes on for several days. I do not know why folks act like this but do not do it in my comment section. Periodt!  Sigh. Otherwise good ice breaker for whites. This quickly needs to be followed up by real facts provided by Black folks: Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson would be my suggestion. Now you know why you feel sensitive and why you do not need to- here 's the history you benefit from and the effect it has on those who do not benefit so you do.  Edited to add an expanded suggested reading list: Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat by J. Sakai Black and British by David Olusoga So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo When They Call You A Terrorist by Patrisse Khan-Cullors The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander White Rage by Carol Anderson How We Get Free by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor The Price for their Pound of Flesh by Daina Ramey Berry Why I am No Longer Talking to White People about Race by Reni Edo-Lodge Well that escalated quickly by Franchesca Ramsey Medical Apartheid by Harriet A Washington The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin The History of White People by Nell Irvin Painter Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble Black Resistance, White Law by Mary Frances Berry Sundown Towns by James Loewen Freedom is a Constant Struggle by Angela Davis A Terrible Thing to Waste: Environmental Racism and Its Assault on the American Mind by Harriet A Washington Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram X. Kendi FYI feel free to copy & paste or SS and share with credit.  3 book reviews: this book is currently at the top of the new york times best seller list. it s been there for eleven weeks straight, right in front of several other non-fiction books about race and racism written by people of color. it holds an average 4.5 rating here on goodreads with 32k+ ratings.  it s also written by a white woman.  yes, well, bear with me.  the arguments in favor of that are about how white people accept criticism and callouts way better from other white people. they might even sit down to listen and learn. heck, robin diangelo makes that very point in this book, too. and i can already hear people say,  yes and no. white people are definitely responsible for their own education on these sorts of topics. however, there is a deeper underlying problem with this particular book, and that is this:    sure, diangelo gives her readers a quick, repetitive Racism 101 class. you get to learn about white privilege, white fragility, white tears, white guilt, white supremacy, and white allyship (are you sensing a theme yet?). mostly about how white people shouldn t get so damn defensive all the time, and how they shouldn t make racist jokes in corporate environments.  and that s it.  there is . there is no explanation nor exploration of the reasons we live in a racist society. there is no discussion on how our racist society is upheld on a daily basis, through policy and law and other powerful tools of oppression. there is no mention of the collective trauma and pain that racism causes and has caused, except for those off-hand microaggressions in clean, almost sterile corporate settings.  not at any point does this book teach genuine empathy. it does not evoke a strong sense of injustice, nor does it radicalize or stimulate its reader to the point of antiracist action.  and even the titular white fragility becomes , a defensiveness that white people should learn to suppress or control -- and never a thing that can spark actual violence and threat in the daily lives of many people of color.  i honestly don t mean to downplay microaggressions; they re immensely mentally exhausting. but reading this book as if we as a society are beyond racist violence (and legislation), and white people merely need to watch what they re saying to people of color at work. i can very easily see the target group of this book reading this and going,  it also doesn t help to know that diangelo is a business consultant who s made it her job to teach other white people about racism and whiteness, and off of workshops on these topics. and from what i ve been hearing and seeing of those, even within this book, they come across as just as devoid of any historical context or genuine exploration of harmful stereotypes.  in the end, what this book is about  only one side of the coin is shown, shoveling out a version of  racism  in its meant for white consumption. it has none of the history, none of the trauma, and barely any black voices or voices of color.  i also sincerely doubt whether this book would be enough for white people who go in any prior knowledge or education on racism. if i imagine someone coming in waving their finger around telling me i m not allowed to do this or that (including crying out of empathy) , i d probably dismiss it right away and be like,  which you can see happening here on goodreads too, by the way. a lot of the 1-star reviews are of exactly that sentiment.  so no, . on its own, it does very little, except perhaps infuriate me a great deal.  such as diangelo casually shitting on black history month and obama s presidency. i mean, neither are exempt from criticism , but i m really not interested in reading a white woman s on these topics while she is (1) preaching to other white people about racism, and (2) not giving any CONTEXT for the criticism itself.  because i doubt the first thing a white person trying to understand racism needs to know is that black history month is bad because it reinforces .  anyway, if you re a white person who got something out of this book, good for you i guess. but this is not the time to study your own whiteness; this is the time and your country. this is the time to sit down and try to grasp the full breadth of what racism is and what it does to people of color .  pick up angela davis. read james baldwin. check out ibram x. kendi. michelle alexander. bell hooks. ronald takaki. carol anderson.  educate yourself on actual historical events and black/poc experiences, and leave this white-centered corporate workshop for what it is.     4 book reviews: I am undecided as to how to rate this book. On the one hand, it 's a fantastic first step for folks just becoming aware of racism. But personally, as a POC who has been engaging with these concepts for years now, I found it very rudimentary. Which I ca not really criticize it for! It 's meant to be rudimentary! But it meant that my reading experience was both quick and a little dull. Which is no fault of the book. I will say that I was introduced to some sociological concepts that I had not been familiar with, which I appreciated. But otherwise, it 's Racism 101 for White Folks, and it 's explicitly tailored to that purpose. And again: it 's a first step. This is a short book that tries to cover a lot of topics quickly and easily. It 's not enough, but it 's a fantastic start.  What I will say about the book from a more objective standpoint is that I wish more examples had been included. DiAngelo focuses a lot on theory, which of course is important, but she also repeats herself a lot. I think a more useful approach would have been to talk more about specific examples of white fragility that she encountered in her workshops and break down the various problematic aspects. It was when she spoke about specific encounters that I was most engaged, and I think her points came across much more clearly when she used those examples.  So, overall, a great book if you are just getting started learning about structural racism, but also a good refresher if you are already somewhat familiar.   5 book reviews: The book raises striking and specific points about how as whites we have biases toward race while pretending we are colorblind. She states specific examples, and outlays practical way forward.  Most of the lower star ratings of this book seem to be exhibiting the exact fragility she outlines, and really only prove to drive her point home further. Even more, they seem to ignore the very clear outlining in the book of difference between personal and systemic racism. That the way forward is to stop taking things personally when accused of being a part of the problem, and instead to look to ways to contribute to the dismantiling of systems in place. Few whites are racist, but all whites participate in racist systems. It 's on us to learn to step into the discomfort and let healing begin. That 's what this book addresses.  6 book reviews: This is a sometimes interesting yet essentially broken vessel for the author 's frustration in dealing with the ignorant and often prejudiced white people who have participated in her diversity seminars. The book trolls those participants while purporting to be a learning tool itself.  To a limited extent, it is that tool. Its chapter on white privilege provides a superb overview. Likewise its chapter on the essentially racist character of much U.S. history. These lessons can also be found elsewhere, including Google. Unfortunately, its flaws far outweigh its virtues. Who is this book for? The audience is clearly liberal whites, and masochistic ones at that. Why masochistic? Because . It simply and repeatedly instructs its white readers on why they are racist and will always be racist. To \"learn\" this lesson is to parrot back what the author has told them, while backing it up with facts about American history and white privilege. Dialogue and emotional responses from trainees are not just disdained, they are seen as pervasive symptoms of racism. A person can read this polemic and gain an understanding of white culpability today and throughout history. But it provides no impetus to move forward, to create actual change. The book is a dead end.  Lessons learned should provide meaningful paths to the future. Better paths. Paths to protest, to repair, to dialogue, to activism, to legislation. But White Fragility exists in a vacuum, it ignores such potentialities. It only scolds. If you acknowledge your apparently inherent racism as a white person, it has done its job. Congratulations, racist. Now just shut up, there is nothing more for you to do.  As a trainer who trains people of all races to provide peer support to other people of all races; as an individual who identifies variously as mixed-race, Filipino, and white; and as a professional in a leadership position at my agency who wants to encourage openness and reflection from my nervous white colleagues on the topics of racial equity and anti-racism... this book was utterly useless to me. This is a reductive book in all ways.  1.5 stars, rounded down.    (quotes from the book are in italics)  > Well I like the forward, maybe because I am mixed-race and she seems to be bending over backwards to understand me:  But anyway, on to reading some white-bashing written by a white person! That always amuses me. STOP, MARK. You want to get something from this, you need to adjust your bad attitude! Keep an open mind, Mark!  > LOL: - Um, no.  Liberals & progressives (like myself) are used to being bashed by conservatives, Republicans, the deplorables, but I have always found the most skilled bashers of liberals & progressives to be other liberals & progressives. Such a masochistic breed! People with empathy know the softest spots, and where to hit the hardest. The ignorance of that comment about white progressives sorta took my breath away. Not a great start.  > This part is true, and I am seeing this now as I have seen it before, in discussions we are currently having at my very progressive agency:  - DiAngelo 's definition of \"Individualism\" is remarkably self-serving. Particularly in how she posits it as an ideology that props up racism. I think I get where she 's coming from: she wants white people to focus on one particular trait - whiteness - and not on how all people are individuals because they are the intersection of many different identities. And there 's truth to the idea that whites are afforded an individuality that POC are often unable to attain in group settings and in representations in the media. But I am not loving how she refuses to see complexity of identity as a valid way to understand how different people engage with the world, and how she would rather look at all whites as simply white. Although I understand that not wanting to look at the complexity of individuals means your message will be very easy to package and sell! In general, DiAngelo is quite comfortable with generalizing - she 's a sociologist after all. But does not she realize that she 's doing the exact same thing to white people that POC have complained about being done to us/them for approximately forever? And how has that worked out?  > This feels true: - I do have a challenge with this idea of a \"white experience\" because class and other factors are not being taken into consideration. Is there a monolithic \"white experience\"? I should ask some white people! As a mixed-race person, this sort of tribalism is hard for me to understand. But as a half-white person, perhaps I should just examine my own experiences. How often have I \"passed\"? And how would I even know, absent overt displays of racism towards me?  > This is ye olde collegiate definition of racism that I actually agree with: - Earlier she mentioned that POC can be prejudiced just like whites, so that combined with her definition of racism makes sense to me. While anyone can \"pre-judge\" others, and discriminate against them, \"racism\" can only be exhibited by the race that holds the most power. But I wonder how she will link this definition to her basic idea that all whites are racist.  > - I have railed against this in various reviews of modern genre novels, this white norm that occurs in settings where that does not make sense. In the novel most explicitly. And still I persist in wondering: if the majority of the population in a given place is a certain race, would not that race always be considered the norm? There 's something true and also something so obvious, so meaningless about her definition of whiteness.  - She makes an interesting case for \"white supremacy\" to be seen as a political system, a system that includes everything from government to entertainment. If only by her use of stats to illustrate percentages of whites in positions of leadership. I can then compare those percentages to the actual percentage of white people in the US, which ends up being @ 87% whites in those positions vs. 73% of whites in the US population. Food for thought.  - I am not in love with her example of a white mother shushing a child saying \"Mommy, his skin is black!\" as upholding the idea that black is a disability or less than white. Could not it be because Mommy does not want her kid to be othering another person?  - I was on-board with her definition of \"aversive racism\" as the kind of racism - although I would actually call it prejudice - practiced by people, consciously or unconsciously, when using coded language to describe black spaces. But I am not so on-board with the example of a friend talking about a dangerous neighborhood meaning that that friend had a \"horror of black spaces\". I think there is clearly a potential racial corollary there, but at the same time this is too simplistic. To insist that the description of a neighborhood as \"dangerous\" is only about its blackness seems to be a self-serving way to turn what is a loaded statement - i.e. potentially prejudiced but also possibly about class systems - into a genuinely racist statement. So yeah, more generalizations.  > DiAngelo equates when people of color are present with and with actions like . - These seem to me to be very different sorts of behavior, some being examples of prejudice or racism while others being a lot more complex. But hell, why not call them all \"examples of racially conscious behavior\" because that 's the book I am reading.  - The chapter HOW DOES RACE SHAPE THE LIVES OF WHITE PEOPLE? is the most sustained exploration of how white privilege is lived unconsciously that I have read so far in the book. Of course the last page diminishes all that came before by engaging in DiAngelo 's typically lazy generalizations, but for the most part, this is really effective. I also love the idea of \"white innocence\". This all could be useful for me as a trainer - except I am almost always training people who identify as leftist, and they are usually already fully aware of how they (if they are white) benefit from being white. And so they appreciate my discussion of privilege more as a series of handy tips and reminders on how to be a better volunteer & person rather than as a launching point for cultural self-exploration. Because they have already done all that self-exploration, usually in college, and that 's why they moved to the Bay Area in the first place. Well, that and those Big Tech greenbacks, of course. Gotta make that money if you wanna be a true coastal elite, amiright?  > - I question this cause & effect. Especially in light of the recent protests, but also in general. It seems to be admonishing binary thinking while actually engaging in it. If someone does not consider themselves racist, why then does this automatically mean they will not engage in anti-racism?  - Very interesting point about how \"color-blind claims\" (e.g. \"I do not see race\") and \"color-celebrate claims\" (e.g. \"I have people of color in my family\") both function as ways to exempt people from engaging in conversations about racism.  > - This was a somewhat shocking thing for me to read because this has not been my experience at all as a POC. Of course I have experienced racism, numerous times, but not from the words or deeds of actual friends. What makes me different from all the POC that DiAngelo has met? Is it because I am mixed race? Am I just lucky, just ignorant, just benefiting from my mixed-race status, or is DiAngelo just stacking the deck? I honestly do not know.  - It 's interesting to me that the author has so far (to page 112) only provided examples (during her experiences as a diversity trainer) of people who defiantly oppose what she is teaching them. Will there be any examples of her getting through to people, how she got through to them, how they improved, how workplaces became safer spaces for POC, etc? Or are all of these examples meant to say that white people will always fail at understanding their racist behavior, no matter what or how she tries to teach them? It 's a curious use of her real life experiences. Is this a purposeful indictment of all white people or an inadvertent indictment of her own methods and ideologies as a diversity trainer? Or maybe she 's just shy of talking about her accomplishments! Yes, let 's say that, it 's a better look.  - Ok, page 114 did make me smile with its mordantly amusing story of a young white woman whose co-workers were afraid she was having an actual heart attack after being criticized for making certain comments. But I still really wish there was a part 2 to that story, describing how DiAngelo ended up engaging this melodramatic young woman successfully. Did that part 2 ever happen? It would have been useful for me as a trainer and as a colleague interested in proactive dialogue with my white colleagues. But I suppose that 's not the point of this book, which is apparently to just repeatedly provide examples of white fragility. *Sigh*  > Sweet Jesus, now DiAngelo has taken it upon herself to denounce the basic guidelines for building trust in a training as     - I dunno what to even say. It 's like she perfectly understands white privilege but has no actual comprehension about how to reach people. Does she not understand that gathering people in a room and telling them all how wrong they are, and will always be, is not an effective mechanism for genuine change or understanding? Or that these guidelines have helped POC in trainings to also feel safe enough to express opinions and share experiences? Ugh!  - Ok I was prepared to hate this chapter entitled WHITE WOMEN S TEARS. I have heard about DiAngelo 's thoughts on this. But it does make some solid points: tears and other emotional displays can be a form of manipulation and they can shift focus away from the important topic at hand. That said, DiAngelo barely acknowledges the most frequent reason women (AND MEN) cry in these settings: because they are experiencing sorrow or pain over something they have learned about themselves, or are reacting to a story they are hearing that illustrates a terrible injustice or a painful experience. It is like the author does not really want to acknowledge the importance and necessity of empathy as a key to bridging divides.  - Last chapter finally features the book 's sole example of a breakthrough from a white person who acknowledges their problematic behavior and gracefully accepts feedback, promising to learn from the experience. This white person is... Robin DiAngelo! I assume DiAngelo could think of no other examples to provide. LMAO  7 book reviews: Definitions Here is the premise of a book I m going to write: every person over eighteen is a child abuser. All adults are involved in a conspiracy to abuse children, and to maintain this status quo. If I confront you, an adult, about this and you react with anger, sadness, argumentation, silence, walking away, or any other possible human emotion, you have confirmed my accusation. You might think you deeply care about children, and you would never abuse them, but this is either denial or your subconscious group bias to preserve your adult privilege. I do not need to provide actual proof for my accusation, since I ve done a lot of thinking and this was the logical conclusion I came up with. Whenever a child confronts you with your abusiveness, you should thank them for their feedback, apologize and immediately change your behavior. You are a child abuser. Oh, by the way, my definition of child abuse is  doing anything that makes the child unhappy , but I couldn t bother to come up with a new term so let s just stick with this.  If you replace  children  with  black people  and  abuse  with  racism , you get a good idea of  White Fragility  by Robin DiAngelo. It s a ludicrous book, filled with hypocrisy and inconsistency, and everything you ve come to expect from the ideology of identity politics. If you already subscribe to the far left hivemind, you can safely skip this book, since it won t give you any new instructions on how to act and think. For everyone else, there is zero value in reading this if you re interested in actual insights into actual racism.   The first red flag you will encounter is reading the foreword written by none other than Michael Dyson, whose idea of debating someone is calling them an  angry white man . At least he s upfront when he writes  This book is unapologetically rooted in identity politics.  Moving on to the actual book, the first chapters give the reader some insights into the inconsistency of this ideology. DiAngelo writes:   'For example, in a group in which I am the only woman, gender will likely be very salient for me. When I am in a group that is all white, except for one person of color, race will likely be my most salient identity.   Whether your (arbitrarily) chosen characteristic is a majority or minority in a group of people, you can somehow always twist it into being key to your identity. The author reveals a glimpse of her definition of racism in these first paragraph. It s the same, tiresome Marxist claim regarding a  position of power  of  white people  over  people of color  (PoC for short), without defining any of these terms. Throughout the book she adds to her list of meaningless terminology, with phrases such as 'collective white consciousness , which certainly doesn t improve its readability.  After introducing us to her unconventional definition of racism, the following paragraphs are mostly spent on anecdotes and accusations as evidence for white supremacy. Among other claims, the author states that white people feel entitled to an advantage due to their race, that white people feel superior (either unconsciously or unadmitted), there s a conspiracy of white people to uphold the status quo, and white people reacting with emotions such as  anger, fear and guilt , or actions like 'argumentation, silence and withdrawal' are evidence of their racism. It would make for a perfect flow chart, where the only box you can end up in is labeled  white supremacist . Bret Weinstein, in his talk  How the Magic Trick is Done  did a brilliant game-theoretical analysis of this blame game, which I highly recommend you watch on YouTube.  Here are some more gems from the book that proof you are a racist:  - If you constantly talk over other people, for whatever reason, those people better only be white. Because if you talk over black people, that is racist.  - If you call all your female students 'girl', those students better only be white. Because if you call a black student 'girl', that is racist.  - If a black person builds a certain piece of software (a survey), and you don t like it, that s racist.  Somehow not racist is Joan, a black woman:  'While Karen sees herself as a unique individual, Joan sees Karen as a white individual'.  It borders on the utterly insane, where racism magically disappears if an act is committed by a person of color. In a piece for The New Yorker, Kelefa Sanneh did a great job of summarizing the madness:   DiAngelo is endlessly deferential for her, racism is basically whatever any person of color thinks it is. In the story she tells about the world, she and her fellow white people have all the power, and therefore all the responsibility to do the gruelling but transformative spiritual work she calls for. The story makes white people seem like flawed, complicated characters; by comparison, people of color seem good, wise, and perhaps rather simple. This narrative may be appealing to its target audience, but it doesn t seem to offer much to anyone else.   Since Sanneh is a  person of color , I can only imagine how DiAngelo s brain would short circuit reading this critique of her world view, since by her own standards she should accept the feedback and change her behavior. Game theoretically, DiAngelo s system is terrible, since there needs to be a distinction between genuine racism and a clumsy remark. Between confronting a racist, and the need to grow a thicker skin. Between someone giving valuable feedback about your behavior, and someone with bad intentions guilting you into being a racist.   For a work with immensely strong suggestions, there is very little data or evidence the author is able to show. The obvious one she repeatedly falls back on is the Far Left s favorite toy: the implicit bias test. Even though this test is severely flawed and misused for multiple reasons, DiAngelo has no problem basing broad generalizations on it. There is a complete lack of nuance and restraint in her writing, reaching conclusions going far beyond those of the social scientists she cites. Furthermore, even if the implicit bias test was valid, it s not self-evident that making people aware of this bias would be beneficial.  At times her statements are not just unnuanced, but simply faulty. Take for example the following quote, about representation:  'Most persons of color have rarely, if ever, had a teacher who reflected their own races'.  A quick Google search will show you that this is simply false, no matter how you twist or turn it. Obviously, she doesn t mention that male teachers and non-white teachers are approximately the same percentage, since this would interfere with the narrative of oppression.  Besides the lack of basic fact checking, the author continuously demonstrates her (deliberate?) misunderstanding of statistics. Any scientist worth their salt will tell you that correlation does not imply causation, but DiAngelo will have you believe otherwise. I wonder if the author also believes that consumption of ice cream increases your chances of drowning? For more on this subject, I recommend the fantastic book  The Coddling of the American Mind  by Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff; which dissects much of the mindset found in this book.  In one of the later chapters, the author goes over the so-called  rules of engagement  regarding confronting a racist (read  white people ). It s baffling how DiAngelo acts like  giving someone feedback in private , or  assume my good intentions  are somehow rules specifically invented for white people, as opposed to general social standards. If I have a colleague who eats at their desk and doesn t clean up their mess, I follow the same principles. Not because they re a white supremacist, but simply because that s the best way to give feedback to people.  Without elaborating on every rule she mentions, it s specifically noteworthy that the author believes we cannot consciously change our assumptions or interpretation of someone s intentions. Yes, you can. In the example above, I might think that my colleague deliberately wants to make a mess to piss everyone in the office off. However, since I don t know that, I am going to assume they are unaware of it. DiAngelo continuously shows her misunderstanding of basic human interactions by weird statements such as not being able to control your assumptions, and it takes (even more) away from her credibility.   For all the creative terms DiAngelo and her fellow radicals have come up with (white guilt, white tears, white flight, white fragility), you d think she could coin a new term for her definition of  racism . Throughout the book, she occasionally touches upon problematic issues actually worth focusing on, such as racial framing by police and  persons of color  being expected to leave the hospital faster than white people. However, it is completely unacceptable to frame everything as racism, and to label every white person a racist.  Racism is believing that certain races are superior or inferior, and to deliberately treat people of other races as if they are inferior. To accept someone labeling you as racist for a clumsy, well-meant remark interpreted in the worst way possible, is a dangerous form of concept creep. It means accepting the guilt (and possible punishment) of something horrible, without actually being guilty of it. Another example of this concept creep used by the author, and a common tactic by the Far Left, is the term  language of violence'. No matter how harsh, language is never violence. If you accept that it is, don t be surprised to find people justifying actual violence against you.    White Fragility  is unscientific, illogical, hypocritical and highly repetitive. Most importantly, it uses a definition for  racism  that is unacceptable, even though some of the underlying concepts might be valid. Actual racism exists, and the world would be a better place without it. Some groups, whether defined by race, gender, age or whatever, face certain challenges we could all help with. None of this, however, is a takeaway when you read this book.  As DiAngelo writes towards the ending of the book, it s best to  focus on the message, and not the messenger'. The main message of this book is  All white people are racist . Regardless of the messenger s race, gender, age or sexuality, that s a stupid message.  8 book reviews: An excellent, powerful book I would recommend to all white people. It scares me a bit to write that because I imagine some white people may take offense to that statement (an emotional reaction Robin DiAngelo discusses in the book), and at the same time I stand by it. I will write a little about this book s high quality, though I want to start with a personal story that may help explain why this book means a lot to me.  Around a year ago, I called a white woman colleague out on a behavior of hers that involved racism and colonization. Before I did so, I tried very hard to make sure that I delivered my concern in a gentle and affirming way. I put in extra effort to validate her as a person and I acted even nicer than perhaps I should have felt obligated to. This white woman asked me to meet in person after I emailed her my concern, and because I had trusted her, I agreed to this meeting.  In this meeting, this white woman displayed the exact set of behaviors DiAngelo describes in this book   white fragility. She said that she felt offended and hurt that I would accuse her of behaving in a colonizing/racist way. She said that no one in her life had ever or would ever call her out on this behavior. She said that I acted  aggressively  and that I should have  trusted  her more instead of blaming her. I want to reiterate that throughout this in-person meeting, I tried again and again to placate her with gentle reassurances while standing my ground. Still, she said that she felt hurt and centered her feelings over mine.  After this meeting, I felt devastated. I walked to my office, shut the door, and practiced a lot of deep breathing to calm down. I felt so misunderstood and tone-policed   I had just tried to offer this white woman gentle feedback on a problematic behavior, and she acted as if I had attacked her. Luckily, I was able to reach out to my friends (both people of color and white friends) who validated my experience and I read a ton of articles on tone-policing to understand that other people of color, especially black women, undergo the same discriminatory behavior.  I share this experience for the specific purpose of highlighting why I feel so grateful for Robin DiAngelo. Due to this incident and others, there are times where I feel fearful of sharing my true self and my authentic reactions around white people, because a lot of white people practice and white fragility. DiAngelo names these behaviors and explains how they hurt people of color. She breaks down the common ways white people collude in white supremacy, the problematic nature of the good/bad binary in relation to racism, and common racial triggers for white people. Here is a quote I appreciated about why white fragility acts as a form of bullying:    I know that I should not applaud DiAngelo for doing the work that all white people should do, and again, I feel grateful to know that there are white people who will do the work of racial justice. Allies matter. For better or worse, white people listen to fellow white people more than they listen to people of color when it comes to racism, so we need white allies to show up to help dismantle white supremacy. Reading this book validated the experiences I have undergone as a person of color and helped reassure me that while there are a lot of white people who will hurt me, like the white woman in the incident described above, there are others, hopefully, who will use their privilege to fight for people of color. Here is another quote about how emotions are political and related to issues of social justice:    Again, highly recommended to all white people and also people of color interested in this topic. DiAngelo s writing is clear, straightforward, and intelligent. She analyzes the issue of white fragility with great depth while providing tangible actions white people can take to address this issue. I hope white people who read this book will utilize its lessons and apply them to their own lives, whether or not anyone else watches. I hope that my fellow people of color know that you are not alone in experiencing white fragility and its painful repercussions.  9 book reviews: my favorite review of this book 10 book reviews: Victim role and defense mechanisms prevent an emancipated and enlightened reappraisal of past and present grievances, culminating in worsening of system immanent problems, backlashes, and indirect and unconscious promotion of racial divide. Building mental suppression reflexes, fortifications against unwanted truth, is a sign of an immature and romantic idealization of one s ego for the price of being part of the problem.  The term aversive racism is well chosen, it s exactly the subconscious mechanism many are unwilling to accept as part of their socialization and conditioning, an epigenetic factor expanding in those trying to be against prejudices, but unwillingly promoting them in a way they don t even see. It s the misuse of altruism by indirectly enforcing stereotypes, belittling minorities and other ethnicities, and downplaying the own bias and agenda one deems positive.  Look at who built Western society, what inhuman ideologies they had, and think about what that means about the foundations of any system and how much of it is still there under the surface. If one isn t willing to accept it and wants to keep living the illusions while having a privileged life, try this one: Contrast the reality with a fictional culture built by women for women, an ecotopia by environmentalists, a techno utopia by futurists, etc. In none of these cases someone would deny that key elements of the main ideas can be seen in all elements of the culture, but in reality, of course, no, thank you, inappropriate idea, we are over that, everything is fine.  Ignoring own problems worsens them and the older we get the more passive aggressive indirect racist mindsets, that are often indirectly expressed in economic and political contexts, come to mind. Whenever a person is insecure about not possibly promoting ideologies that have integrated exploitative and evil elements, one can easily find cozy reassurance of the righteousness of one 's behavior thanks to echo chambers and media exponentiating the hypnotizing sound of all these decent people who can t all be wrong.  And then, bam, someone dares to tell the truth about such self deception mechanisms that don t just include individual blinders, but many other, good willing people with the same opinion, friends, family,  that of course also don t deem themselves part of the problem and the natural reaction is, of course, extreme outrage, pure white fragility.  I, an activist for years, decades, having so many friends of all ethnicities, etc. yada, should be a bigoted, opportunistic enforcer of racist ideas? You, harbinger, are wrong and should be ashamed for making me feel bad about your fake history news! And I am activating my being offended mode because now I just feel and can t think anymore.   It s exactly what I ve experienced with many other problems privileged, white people don t have to deal with and build illusions, ivory towers, and excuses for their inactions and stubborn behavior around them.instead. In Europe, precisely Austria, it s done with refugees, the economic system, nazi past, sexism, conservatism, etc that way. People have their unbalanced, strange, implemented opinions they mainly built on news media, friends, and family instead of book and science and repeat bias, mantras, and illogical and bad explanations. As soon as someone points the finger on the hard, real facts, they react this way, get aggressive, change topic, do as if they didn t mean it that way, behave like expected by good extremists and fanatics. The refuge of pseudointellectual wanna be experts that keep repeating whatever their social media feed drips in their mind, even infecting people that should know better.  Even well meaning people who are active in charity organizations, NGOs,  are prone to this blind spots, some strange examples I ve tried out: Try talking to environmentalist about positive aspects of NGOs, to human rights activists about dehumanizing elements of our whole system and how it indirectly promotes circles of violence instead of just helping whistleblowers and journalists, to hard working people who invest much of their money in destructive, useless consumerism, to green party members or to anti racism and equal rights groups about this. Forget it, they will act like kids, immediate defiant phase activation, lalala, don t want to hear. Honestly, part of my misanthropy is that I ve lost interest in and respecting of many people who are so blind to how they have been instrumentalized to greenwash corporate responsibility PR camouflaged as real activism without even recognizing, and absorb the propaganda as part of their identity, thinking we have reached the end of history, attacking anything questioning their distorted and self aggrandizing world view.  They are lost, stranded in a mixture of   salted with     fueled by the  that legitimates their disturbing views with fringe science. Their whole personality is built on nothing more than the soft washed, trivialized, indirect fallout of anachronistic ideals still secretly metastasizing and growing with any descendant of see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. At a moment in history where anyone could build an objective opinion by using the amazing possibilities of wikis, apps, independent media, and progressive nonfiction authors instead of reading the same, repetitive, everything is fine fairy tale unicorn rainbow BS. Instead, they keep being used by forces they don t want to be real, whose main interest is to divide and rule by fueling any kind of conflict between social groups to keep their status.  It made me hyper sceptical regarding many humanities and soft sciences they use as arguments too. It also took me some time over the last decade to go chronologically through the feelings of disbelief, anger, something close to hate (one of the rare emotions I feel next to flow, hungry, the other ry (not sorry), and sleepy), motivation to try to change people, I am still laughing about this one, repeating of the first circle, to end up with cold, cynic apathy for, disinterest in, and avoidance of the overwhelming majority of the population. But it luckily fueled my belief in the youth and the next generation instead.  Power resetting people s mindsets is very difficult and if it s not combined with an extreme ideology (and even then it s close to impossible to make people accept that they ve been wrong over years or decades), but with thinking of themselves as progressive founding mothers and fathers of a better future, it gets close to impossible. They ve invested time, heart blood, belief, studying, debating,  in becoming the person and identify they are and I don t believe many of them will change, because it includes many other aspects of their agenda and ideology, they would have to reevaluate and revise key elements, something too brutal and hard. See what I just did, I indirectly defended white fragility, it s truly a hellish circle.  And an extremely ridiculous one in the eyes of discriminated groups and minorities, it s a kind of black comedy mentally instable person gag where the wealthy, carefree, lucky ones do as if changing the inhuman system that made them rich, and some of their opinions, is something unfair, painful, and gruesome to them.  A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:      11 book reviews: Okay first let me start by saying that I m not rating this book. It s intentional. I don t feel like I can fairly rate a book that was not written for me. It is clearly stated by the author at the beginning of the book and it s clear by the subject matter. I won t even say that I enjoyed this book because some parts were triggering and some parts made me pissed as hell BUT is this knowledge that people should be privy too? Yes. Do I think that all White people will benefit from this information? Yes. It s important. What s ironic about this book is that it s things that Black people have been saying for years HOWEVER sometimes it s best that White people hear this from other White people.  There are a few aspects of this book that I found very important for White people to understand. That includes the good/bad binary, white solidarity, white racial benevolence, coded language and the other meanings of White Fragility. I think that people believe (and yes I mean all people) that if they re a good person (they don t wear white sheets, they don t use the n-word) that means they can t be racist. That s so terribly wrong. And I will say that this book does a brilliant job tearing down that fantasy like ideology.  There s a lot more unpacking that I plan to do of this novel in a full video review. There s a lot to address and I don t truly believe that I can address it all in a Goodreads review. This book definitely had some interesting things to say about how White people are socialized to view the Black community in a certain light even if they get a long with Black people on a one on one or individual basis.   12 book reviews: This book will cut you, white person, no slack. If you think you are progressive about race--and most white people think they are--you will be confronted by this book. It 's not aimed at Klansmembers. It 's aimed at the people who do not recognize where they fall short. That 's me. It 's probably you too. 13 book reviews: You Ca not Win  We had a Native American come to a group that I attend, and the first words out of his mouth were,  I hate blacks.  I wasn t there, but it was my understanding that the leader of the group gave him hell, how much hell I do not know. But no one else spoke up, and this bothered him. I heard this story and ran into him the following week when he sat down at the table where we were having breakfast. When he said that he was from Tulsa, I said,  When I think of Tulsa I think of the race riot in 1920 when the white people burned down the black town in Tulsa, a large neighborhood with stores, doctors, lawyers, ministers, shop keepers, etc, and they killed men, women, and children.  I was trying to see for myself where this man would go with what I was telling him. He claimed that it was the black man s fault, so I said,  If it was, there was no excuse to kill everyone they found and burn down their town.  I went on to say that I had read books on the riot, now called a  massacre,  and I didn t see it as any black man s fault. He felt that we should not even be talking about something that happened `100 years ago. I said,  They do because they have been traumatized.: I am not quick on conversations like this, but I would have added, :and they still are being traumatized due to senseless killings, etc.   He said then that he didn t like talking about race because he has been accused of being racist. When he got up from the table where we were sitting, he said that the KKK were good people, but I didn t hear him; instead I my friend, who was sitting next to me, told me his last words.  So, I talked with the group leader, saying that people don t know what racism is, that if they believe it to be true that a certain race is lazy or violent, etc. they don t consider themselves to be racists. I added that we need a lecture on it. He said that people don t listen to him because he is brown. I replied,  My ex white friends didn t listen to me either, even though they believed I was completely white.  Well, the next time we had that group meeting, the racist man wasn t there, but the leader talked about racism. It was this book that he used, so I got it.  I am sorry to say this: I didn t care for this book sometimes her language was above my level of understanding. But then I felt myself getting pushed out of shape because it felt like she wanted to show everyone in her group that they were all racists. Maybe I am wrong here.  I am sure if I were in this author s group she would believe that I was a racist, that is just what I felt when reading this book, although I consider myself an anti-racist. A white person couldn t win. She seems to give no credit where credit is due.  One woman had said that she had friends who were black and on and on. The author was not impressed. So, I suppose you can t say that you dated black men or Hispanic, etc. or that you were even married to one.  Back to the group that I attend weekly: Someone in our group brought up the governor, the one who wore black face in college. One person felt he should step down, I said,  I didn t think so.  I didn t add this:  We all make mistakes. I am interested in what kind of person he is now. Is he doing good?  But I imagine that this person felt that I was a racist. And this is the problem in our society now: people are looking to accuse others of racism, and I feel that that is what this author is doing too.  I have a white friend that I have known since my college days. She only dated black men, and she had a daughter from a black man. She used to say that black people were always late for appointments, and she called it  BP Time, Black People s Time.  I imagine that she would be called a racist too, not someone who is just making generalizations.  Update: I decided last night to listen to parts of the book again, and came upon a chapter called  White tears,  tears that white women have when they see violence performed on black people. She claims that white tears are how white people lament on how hard racism is on them, and to back up her beliefs she says that other writers have commented on this too. She says that white women feel entitled to shed them. I listened further, and if any white person in her group begins to cry, they are asked to leave the room, because they are upsetting the black women who can t stand white people s tears. Plus, the woman crying is bringing attention to herself. So, I began to feel that she is standing up for the black people, when she should be investigating all of this in the group encounter that she is running. So, now I am really against this book. Most people don t cry out of white guilt over slavery or to bring attention to themselves or whatever the reason.  Tears come without warning; they are due to compassion, not guilt. I have a hard time believing that white people feel guilty for what their ancestors did in the past. Maybe some do. But most of all we cry when we see pain in others. It doesn t matter if they are black or white or brown. Who hasn t felt the pain of the children at the Mexican border who are crying and being torn from their mother s arms? Well, not everyone does as I have found out. I know of three people, when I mentioned this, immediately brought up how the Democrats behave. They deflected the subject, didn t care about the children. Perhaps we feel guilty for chasing the Mexicans back to Mexico many years ago. Or for giving these  lazy  Mexicans jobs that the white man didn t wish to perform, paying them very little and not caring for their medical needs.  I cried at the Wounded Knee museum when I read about the massacre of the Lakota Indians, whom I consider my people, even though I am not Lakota but Cherokee. Did I feel guilty because I wasn t there? Did I feel guilty because my white ancestors killed them?  I cried when I read about the Tulsa race riot and went to the museum in Tulsa and saw that there was no black town left.  The author can call it what she wants, but I am not buying it. A much better book to read is, Dear White America by Tim Wise. He educates, explains racism without accusing. Any book by him is better than this one. He is a white anti-racist. I would also suggest reading books by black writers or take courses in black history. If fingers are still pointed at the white people, you can be sure that you won t be blamed. And it will help you to see your own shortcomings without having any white guilt placed on you or be told that you are a racist.  14 book reviews: As a Japanese woman I am appalled by the level of racism against white people the author is demonstrating in this book. And she herself is white! Which goes to show that self-hatred is strong with this one. She essentially says that all white people are racist, whether they know it or not (which shuts down all conversation in and of itself), and that that pseudo-fragility she 's talking about along with the pseudo-reticence white people have when it comes to talking about racism are nothing more than the absolute proof of their conscious and unconscious racism. Which, again, shuts down any conversation about the issue. So basically, if you are white you either don t want to talk about racism because you yourself are racist, or if you do want to talk about racism you really can t because racism is deeply rooted within you (again, whether you know it or not). Either way you lose if you happen to be white. Just because of the fact that your skin is white. Which is the literal definition of racism.  As Morgan Freeman famously said in one of his interviews when asked about racism:  When you point out race, you are racist. So ignore race and do not talk about it.  A wise man indeed.  15 book reviews: There is no doubt that people of color have had and continue to have unfair biases and prejudicial acts committed against them. I agree in this area when she explains, through growing up in the inner city of Chicago, how this is so.  What I do not agree with is her book premise. How she assigns motives to white people, which may not be true..in particular the white woman talking over a black woman. I know plenty of white people who do this on a regular basis, In all white company. Does she really believe that what this woman did was racist. Why could not it just be her forceful, albeit rude, personality? I doubt she thought through the argument that her doing so invalidated the black women 's thoughts and feelings.  Another was white women 's tears, could not they be used as a teachable moment? Why was she crying? Could not this help open a dialogue?  For me this book will have the opposite effect than intended. Whites will become so defensive that they will be afraid to discuss rascism. If honest emotions are wrong, where do we go from there? I agree this is an important subject, a crucial one, but do not feel this book propelled anything forward.  16 book reviews: I think the book resonated with me because in this turbulent time, I see every last one of these behaviors, right now in real time. It 's like she 's following me on social media. ------------------ [White fragility] is an idea that registers the hurt feelings, shattered egos, fraught spirits, vexed bodies, and taxed emotions of white folk. In truth, their suffering comes from recognizing that they are white that their whiteness has given them a big leg up in life while crushing others  dreams, that their whiteness is the clearest example of the identity politics they claim is harmful to the nation, and that their whiteness has shielded them from growing up as quickly as they might have done had they not so heavily leaned on it to make it through life.  Holy cow, I can already tell I am going to enjoy this book! But you can get out of my head now   Well since you wo not get out of my head; what else you got  Yep   Clearly I need to break away from featuring quotes or I am going to end up republishing the book (there will be more ). DiAngelo \"spilled the tea\" on the things white people do to maintain privilege. The fact that this is a white person telling of all the mental gymnastics that people do to avoid accountability was (I am not gonna lie) so satisfying for me. It 's an almost urgent timber. Inevitably this book will be compared with . Both books should be required reading but I found White Fragility the more compelling. I think that is because DiAngelo is speaking to a white audience as a white person telling them how their worldview frames themselves, people of color in general and Black people in particular. This is definitely #ownvoices stuff! It would seem that even the most \"woke\" among us are resistant to the idea that there are some racist paradigms lurking amid the \"wokeness\". I actually saw a review of this book on goodreads that said (paraphrased) Sigh. Oh to be Robin DiAngelo. The intransigence. The blindness. The lack of empathy. The overwrought concern about not being perceived as a \"good\" person. The indelible imprint of systemic racist culture that people try to deny. Racism is wearying and tedious. And oh how uncomfortable it must be to recognize many of the things that DiAngelo is talking about in oneself. And by the way, people of color are not exempt from many of the self delusions, logic fallacies, rationalizations and intimidation that promote and sustain white privilege/supremacy. One does not have to be white to have deployed many of the defensive mechanisms and tactics DiAngelo talks about. Tactics that we use generally to protect ideas/ideology that we do not want to change.  In the age of Trump, I see many these behaviors play out in real time in my facebook timeline. For example: Like clockwork this graphic showed up in my feed from multiple sources. Here is the new itch as of late, the removal of confederate statues.    Winston Churchill said . Indeed. Who gets to determine what elements of history get preserved and what gets erased? Do these folks even understand what they are saying? These are principally the Confederate statues and flags seen all over the US. Erected long after the Civil War ended most of them went up in the 1920s as a form of intimidation for Blacks to reinforce Jim Crow laws and culture. MAGA!! I saw a great response to this which said (paraphrased) \"Satan is a part of Christian history but if we saw multiple statues around in the churches, people would be confused about who they are worshiping.\"  Here 's a fun one that showed up on a friend 's timeline. I am going to let DiAngelo deconstruct this one     It goes on and on. Folks deliberately confuse the legitimate protests with rioting and looting. I did go off on a \"friend\" who was consciously and deliberately trying to establish Black Lives Matter as the source of the looting and destruction of property. It seemed to be this urgent need to put legitimate protests and riots all in the same bucket. Binary thinking! Folks who minimize the numerous Police shootings as bad cops and immediately launch into \"Not all cops are bad\" as if someone said that. These are the same people who insist that \"All lives Matter if someone suggests that Black Lives Matter. It 's all good or it 's all bad. No nuance. This is incredibly childish. The world is not binary. Grow.the.f#ck.up!  And do not get me started on the people of color who think their lived experience makes them experts on racism. It 's an identity narcissism that helps to maintain white privilege and inequality by enabling damaging ideologies and behaviors. I have a friend who is an African American female. She is in real estate so she has to navigates lots of circles but primarily where there is some wealth. She is a very positive person who radiates kindness and genuinely strives to see the good in all people. She sees herself as a bridge. She thought her life experience made her an expert on systemic biases and racism. She tried to start a conversation on fb. Smh and OMG! For example about George Floyd murder one guy said \"we do not know if the officer is a racist because we do not know what was in his heart.\" then blamed the media for blowing it all out of proportion and drumming up resentment. He really thought he was making some kind of irrefutable point. My friend replied \"I agree\" not because she agreed, but she thought it would disarm and open him up for deeper discussion. Ha! She was ill equipped because we have all grown up in these cultural biases. Systemic racism is instilled in Black people too. She like her audience wanted racism to be like the following: But It 's not just lynching and cross burning, but even she does not quite understand the reach and implications of racism. Needless to say, I sent her this book. She does not need to understand how people of color feel about the endless microaggressions, she needs to know how people in the majority view the world and how it differs from her. That 's a point of view that cannot come from people of color. People will rationalize, warp, manipulate and twist reality to maintain their comfort and privilege. Fortunately knowing these things is helpful in dealing with entrenched ideologies in every race, creed, religion, gender and color etc. DiAngelo goes on to define the patterns of behavior associated with \"white fragility\" which to me were on target. I did not expect this book to resonate with me so much. Just read the book. In my view DiAngelo is walking/talking/thinking rosetta stone.    Read on kindle  17 book reviews: Audiobook... ....read by Amy Landon   White progressives cause the most daily damage to people of color .   To the degree that white progressives think we have arrived, we will put our energy into making sure that others see us as having arrived .  Robin DiAngelo  allows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to bad people .  For me - this book was phenomenal! The last couple of days it s become a family affair  hot topic .( Paul, me, Ali, Adam).... a topic we are committed to continue having.... with a deeper commitment to be a stand for black lives matter.  Personal things I looked at: ....a willingness to look at every ounce of bias and prejudice I had. ....I looked at my inner voice over-time... and ways it s changed through listening - education- and a willingness to  stay open . ....my preferences in marriage.... marrying  white  rather than black. I looked at my prejudices straight on. Remorseful for ways I thought. ....reasons I preferred our daughters marry Jewish. Also remorseful for ways I thought. .....reasons why the school busing was a problem to me years ago, so instead, sent our daughters to private schools. (which only segregated our daughters more from black people).... ....I looked at my own racism....( not a picnic to acknowledge I am part of the racial problems), ....not my intention to be racist - but I ve had thoughts that I was glad I was born white. Its an uncomfortable topic .... but willing to look at the good, bad, and ugly inner thoughts I have. ....I want to have more racial conversations with my black friends. ....In school -I never took a class about racial diversity.... but the time has come!!! ....I looked at messages passed on to me as a child... is being white superior than people of color?  Conversations from this book will continue.... ....issues about..... ...Desegregation, ...neighborhoods, ...education, ...Racial reform, ...Unexamined beliefs, ...How I might help with unity associated with racial equality as a white woman. ...what other history - I might continue to read?  This book has been a great support and inspiration to speaking openly about race -without resistance.  .... White Fragility , is a wake up call; a call for action.  Black lives DO MATTER!!!!  Valuable - engaging - thought provoking - difference making - Terrific discussion book! Terrific book.  There are numerous wonderful book reviews on Goodreads!!! Moving as can be!!!  18 book reviews:  I repeat: stopping our racist patterns must be more important than working to convince others that we don t have them. We do have them, and people of color already know we have them; our efforts to prove otherwise are not convincing. An honest accounting of these patterns is no small task given the power of white fragility and white solidarity, but it is necessary.   This is going to be a rambling sort of stream-of-consciousness style review   la Virginia Woolf (minus all the finesse!) I just want to set down in words what has weighed heavy on my mind. This book was a wake-up call and has been in my thoughts every day since I finished reading it. I want it to stay in my head every day. I want the discomfort I felt while reading it not to go away as I do with most things that are distressing. Instead, I want to remind myself of it each morning I climb out of my bed in my privileged white neighborhood in my primarily white suburban American hometown.    These are the words I repeat to myself. I have moved beyond feeling defensive about this fact. Defensiveness really gets you nowhere in any sort of discussion. It shifts the focus from the real problem to something else entirely, and I don t want to make that misstep any longer. I always felt I was a  good  person. I taught my children the  right  things. I didn t need to examine myself too deeply because I didn t think I was doing anything wrong. I thought to myself,  I m not a racist.  Yes, I confused the term with what I thought to be only acts of violence and hatred and prejudice.      As the title suggests, this book examines why white people are often difficult to engage in discussions about racism. And with this as the goal, I think it explains these reasons very effectively. I, for one, learned quite a lot about why I ve never had sustained, meaningful talks with any of my acquaintances about racism. For the most part, we probably imagined ourselves exempt, as we were  not part of the problem . How wrong we were. Now my job is to determine what to do about this next. Reading this book is a beginning but it is most certainly not an end. It needs to be a long journey in order to make it worthwhile.      I ve been having conversations about this book and about racism in general with both family members and some friends over the past couple of weeks or more. Other than with my children, I have run into exactly those obstacles author Robin DiAngelo illustrates here. While my son and daughter will sit patiently and listen openly without defensiveness, I have not found this to be the case with the majority of the adults in my life. It truly is difficult to have a purposeful discussion where the focus is on the critical issue at hand rather than the individual s attempts to rationalize his or her own behavior. No one really wants to look too long in the mirror without making some argument as to why the mirror is not reflecting the perfect image they are seeking. One needs to take a look, admit it is indeed not the ideal reflection, then step away from the mirror and shift the focus to the real problem at hand. Set aside the guilt and self-pity and move forward.     Get over yourself and move on  are the words I said when I looked in the mirror, and I think we would all do well to do the same. So, what is the next step? DiAngelo doesn t necessarily delve into this too much. I don t think it was the point of the book. To me this was a springboard of sorts. It s a knock over your head, a kick in the seat of your pants. It s now time for further education and reading as well as continued attempts at earnest conversations. After that, well, action and involvement in some helpful way seem to me the next obvious leg of the journey. While the message is a clear 5 stars for me, I found parts of this slightly repetitive, therefore my rating is landing on 4 stars. It s an important book that I will urge my acquaintances and loved ones to read.           19 book reviews: The attitudes and emotions behind this book have caused more damage and division than healing. I think the title might better be, \"Guilt of Left Wing Academics\".  Blacks and whites (and Asians and Native Americans and everybody else) are all human. If we keep fanning the hurts and hates of the past we may as well all resign ourselves to being like the middle east still killing each other over wrongs from 4000 years ago.  My black friends and my brown friends and (again) everybody else are simply, \"my friends\".  20 book reviews: The provocative title of this book is a draw. What are we doing, saying, thinking that is unconscious and yet still brings out some kind of anger or fear response in us when challenged? I am constantly learning how much I don t know about race in America and much more there is to know. DiAngelo is also white, by the way. She, too, makes racist mistakes, though more rarely now, even years after immersing herself in how it manifests. We can t escape it. We have to acknowledge it.  That is basically what this book is about. How we must acknowledge our race, that we do in fact see race, that we make assumptions about people based on race, how we need to disrupt habitual patterns of interaction, and then consciously try to put ourselves in the way of disrupting the patterns of racism which are literally claiming the lives of too many people of color for reasons we would never recognize as legitimate in our own lives. It s been give or take one hundred and fifty years since the Civil War. Sometimes it feels as it hasn t been won by anti-slavers. Shame on us.  The first part of the book is a slow and careful baby-steps leading to a hot-button topic, giving readers/listeners time to blow off their indignation and stop being surprised that yes, she is going to talk about white supremacy in American life and how this consistently sidelines the needs, emotions, and opportunities of people of color. She is going to talk about the ways white people consistently deny this truth, do not recognize it applies to white people, all of whom benefit from the system as it operates in the United States. But the best part comes at the end, when she cites people like me who have said, \"Yeah, but I know this already,\" or \"But I m not racist,\" or \"I have friends who are black,\" or \"I ve lived overseas,\" etc.  DiAngelo talks about white solidarity: and and Racism is systemic, institutional, omnipresent, and epistemologically embedded in our reality, according to filmmaker Omowale Akintunde. It is not like murder: we do not have to \"commit it\" for it to happen. It can be unconscious.  The best argument I have ever heard for why we falsely assume racism doesn t exist when we do not mean to do something racist is this: a woman married to a man would never say, \"Because I am married to a man, I have a gender-free life.\" Even a married woman will carry prejudices with her about men. Di Angelo insists we do not set up a false binary: racism is bad, non-racists are good. It is probably better to think of ourselves on a continuum. With effort, we can improve our understanding but because the system operates without our consent, we will never escape it.  We are reminded that the white identity needs black people in order to exist. Around blackness we have created certain myths (about dangerousness, laziness, etc) which we may have thought we d eradicated until some stray incident makes them come flooding back to consciousness. Whiteness is then a false identity, of superiority. A black person who steps out of their  place  and demands to be treated equally, as in sports stars or popular singers, may trigger a backlash. DiAngelo gives a brilliant exegesis of the book/movie about a poor black high school football player adopted by a rich white family, and how it perpetrates dominant white ideologies. That book came out to great acclaim only in 2007. It seems like a lifetime since then, but it is only ten years.  Race and racism are emotional subjects. We may discover the ways whites have perpetrated a system of injustice against people of color out of ignorance, but ignorance is no longer a good excuse. We have work to do disrupting what we see as race bias in America today, making sure our kids are educated in a way that improves their understanding of conscious/unconscious race bias, and making sure they understand their lives will be deficient without interaction with and understanding of black lives.  We must work to widen our circles so that people of color are a part of our worldview, always remembering we are doing this for ourselves, not for the benefit of people of color. We are not being generous; we are seeking justice. Ask for feedback, but don t be overly sensitive when people respond. Feedback is useful. Make sure to keep the focus on learning, not on one s own fragility. And remember, one doesn t have to intend to be racist to act in a racist way. It s the water we swim in.  I listened to the audio of this, narrated by Amy Landon, and had access to a paper copy. DiAngelo gives a terrific short  Continuing Ed  bibliography in the back, sharing other excellent titles. There are sure to be a couple of articles or books or podcast you still haven t seen. There was only one book I admired that I did not see listed there: by Shannon Sullivan, out of the University of North Carolina. DiAngelo makes note of the terrific podcast, , put together by a team headed by John Biewen out of Duke University. All of it is worthwhile.  21 book reviews: I ve had this book on my kindle for over a month now, knowing that it was an important book to read, but I put it off. Why? Maybe because I was afraid of facing my  white fragility  or worse yet finding out I was a racist. The civil rights giant John Lewis passed away a couple of days ago. After reading a number of tributes profiling his life of courage and strength, a life dedicated to righting injustices against black peopIe, I decided it was time.  Perched on my couch in my house in a predominantly white suburb, I watch the protests in the streets of our country. I sit here and applaud Black Lives Matter. I yell at the tv when I see the incidents where black men and women have the police called on them for entering their own apartments, or swimming in their own pools, for just living their lives and for sometimes getting killed because they are black. My heart breaks for those who suffer these discriminations. I tell myself and others that I m not a racist. Not so fast. Could my emotional response be just  my white tears  ? God I hope not! Because for me feeling and caring is part of the equation.  I was taught to treat everyone the same .  So I m not racist. Not so fast. If I say  Race has nothing to do with it. I m not racist - right ? Not so fast.  I have friends who are black.  That makes me not racist - right ? Not so fast.  Robin DiAngelo challenges white people on what racism and white supremacy mean. These are not just overt acts that many of us find atrocious, but the systematic racism that most of us ignore because we think these individual acts that are so abhorrent and are committed only by really terrible people is what racism is. I was particularly struck by these things she lists that I knew on some level, but never really thought about or talked about with anyone. These are just some of the statistics she lists (p 31 - 32) from 2016-2017, an eye opener for most white people on what white supremacy looks like:  * Ten richest Americans: 100 percent white (seven of whom are among the ten richest in the world) * US. Congress: 90 percent white * US governors : 96 percent white * Top military advisors : 100 percent white * People who decide which TV shows we see : 93 percent white * People who decide which books we read : 90 percent white * People who decide which news is covered: 85 percent white * Teachers : 82 percent white * And more   I have to admit I m a little leery about being critical of the book in any way because it s an extremely important book . But I have to say in all honesty, that I don t see Black History Month in the same way as she does. DiAngelo thinks that Black History Month reflects the idea  that racism in the United States can operate outside white people is reinforced through celebrations such as Black History Month, in which we study the Civil War and civil rights eras as if they occurred separately from all US history.  I ve always felt that it emphasizes that these are very much a part of our history and need to be recognized as such. Having said that, I saw her analysis as a first step of thinking in a different way, of looking into ourselves even though it s uncomfortable. It was not easy to read knowing that I am part of the problem. I highly recommend this book. Although she warns us not to depend on people of color for  our racial education , I am compelled to read some James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ibram Kendi.  22 book reviews: I want to preface this review by saying, despite some points I read critically, I do think White Fragility is a thought provoking book. Do I think it 's perfect? No. Do I think a white woman, even one who has studied racial inequities with intense devotion, could illustrate the depth of the societal rot that is racism? No. But it 's a start, and that is something.  I wrote down all these notes that I made while reading White Fragility, but then I came across this article, and the author puts it more succinctly than I could have (...). While this book is thought provoking, it is also lacking in certain fundamental ways. I recommend reading it, because it certainly made me think, but the more I did, the more I felt frustrated with DiAngelo and felt she veered into \"white savior territory\". She, being a white woman, offers vast and generalized criticisms and observations, but very limited solutions. This becomes especially evident when she repeatedly emphasizes how unresponsive people in her workshops are when she tells them they are all racists and how ineffective thus her methods seem to be. I thought a lot about this, wondering if I am being defensive, but I do not think that 's where my issue with this book comes from. Like so many others, shaken by racial inequity and violence that seems to have become a norm, I am finally taking the overdue step of trying to learn more, of trying to listen and have conversations about an issue, so insidious in this society, that we think it is better to just pretend it does not exist. One statement that did really resonate with me in this book was the following, \"One cannot change what one refuses to see\". I want to move forward with my eyes open. This book did not offer everything I hoped it would, but it is perhaps a start. I would highly recommend Chokehold by Paul Butler, which, though I am only halfway through, has already taught me so much more about systemic racism in this country and how one might consider addressing it at all levels. If you disagree with my assessment of the book, I would welcome discussion, but let 's do so respectfully.  Find my book reviews and more at  23 book reviews: Racism is a problem and so it 's good to talk about it as opposed to ignoring it. The author declares in the title that this is hard for white people to do. So the potential plus-value of the book is the author 's method of white-people-engagement. Unfortunately, I have misgivings about that.  I had enough of her approach at the point where she gloated more than once about making someone leave her course because she upset them so much. I do not get that. I teach about race and racism (e.g. health disparities) but I do not take it as a positive if people run out of the room in a huff and never want to hear from me again. I go by \"If the learner did not learn, the teacher did not teach.\" For the author though, when people run away from her, that is proof of their \"white fragility\" and of her correctness. This seems like self-righteous watertight circular reasoning. Maybe somewhere the author showed objective evidence of how her approach does more good than harm; if so I missed it.  People are different, but I would imagine that going to the traveling museum exhibit called \"RACE: Are we so different?\" () would be much much more useful for more people than this type of White Fragility workshop.  Consequences of structural racism in the US are massive. The trivial and not clearly racist affronts (e.g. white lady who talks over everyone) discussed in the book can distract from the big picture. I think there are better books to read about structural racism and what to try to do about it, or how to start talking about it:     24 book reviews: It 's been a few days since I finished this book, and I have been thinking about it so much. I love listening to nonfiction audiobooks and it 's recently come to my attention that I have not read any audiobooks that specifically deal with race and white privilege. This book was a very educational experience for me because before reading this book I had never even heard the term 'white fragility'. This book had so many powerful quotes that I will leave below:   I was co-leading a workshop with an African American man. A white participant said to him, \"I do not see race; I do not see you as black.\" My co-trainer 's response was, \"Then how will you see racism?\"   The key to moving forward is what we do with our discomfort. We can use it as a door out blame the messenger and disregard the message. Or we can use it as a door in by asking, Why does this unsettle me? What would it mean for me if this were true?    The simplistic idea that racism is limited to individual intentional acts committed by unkind people is at the root of virtually all white defensiveness on this topic.                      I will never know what it is like to live in America as a Black person, but the best I can do is educate myself and be a better ally and I feel like this book has opened my eyes to so many things I never considered before. I think this book is a great first step and it will be the first of many nonfiction books that focus on racism that I plan to read soon.  25 book reviews: I have spent the last month discussing this book in a Goodreads group. While the book is only 169 pages, it was helpful to proceed slowly and really talk about the points DiAngelo was trying to make, working past the defensiveness. I feel like it should be required reading for all white people. DiAngelo ends the book with very practical ideas that I found very useful.  Highlights:  -The concept of belonging and how central it is to whiteness, more of an assumption  \"If you believe that you are being told you are a bad person, all your energy is likely to go toward denying this possibility and invalidating the messenger rather than trying to understand why what you have said or done is hurtful. You will probably respond with white fragility. But unfortunately, white fragility can only protect the problematic behavior you feel so defensive about; it does not demonstrate that you are an open person who has no problematic racial behavior.\"  -White fragility as bullying -White women 's tears as a special form of white fragility  \"...Stopping our racist patterns must be more important than working to convince others we do not have them. We do have them, and people of color already know we have them; our efforts to prove otherwise are not convincing. An honest accounting of these patterns is no small task given the power of white fragility and white solidarity, but it is necessary.\"  - The list of assumptions on pages 142-3 are helpful, that if we can agree on those we are starting from a better place and maybe that helps remove some of the defensiveness.  -I appreciated her modeling of how to receive feedback.  26 book reviews:  White fragility is not weakness per se. In fact, it is a powerful means of white racial control and the protection of white advantage.   Should I just regurgitate the message that every white person needs to read this?  Yeah. I think I will.  And some aspects of this fragility can also nicely extend to POC communities.  27 book reviews: I nearly returned this book. I had purchased the audiobook from Audible, and I found the tone to be dry, dull, and schoolmarmish. If I was to picture Robin DiAngelo, it would be my middle school librarian, wagging her finger at me. I had this reaction despite knowing what tone policing is. Despite consciously being aware that it is a common response for white people to focus on the method of information delivery over the actual information being delivered, and to prioritize their comfort over the message, this was still my immediate reaction. That is the strength of white fragility in a nutshell.  My immediate reaction was that I did not need this book: I understand that to say you re  colorblind  is neither helpful nor in any way actually possible. I understand that race influences every aspect of the everyday experiences of people of color, and that as white people, we are responsible to not only be allies but actually to be active proponents and advocates of change. My initial intention in choosing to read the book was to learn how to better navigate conversations about race with more conservative white acquaintances, and out of interest because race in America is something I grapple with personally as I have interrogated my own behavior as a white liberal woman, such as why I would take the time to march for women s rights but not for POC.  I listened to part of the audiobook with my mother in the car. She actually said one of the exact things that DiAngelo calls out as a way we as white people deny responsibility for engagement in race dialogue:  I ve lived in Hawaii, so I know what it feels like to be a minority.  She votes Democrat. She was part of the civil rights movement in the 60s. She makes annual donations to nonprofits that support these causes. She told me to turn the book off and put on NPR.  However, I m so glad I didn t return this book. I m so glad I stayed with it, all the way to the end, because DiAngelo s primary argument is compelling: racism is a system that permeates our society, and that by being a part of that society, white people are inherently going to be racist. We re going to say things and do unacceptable things that within the context of this racially charged environment, within the historical context of oppression and slavery and racial dominance, even despite the fact that some of us may have the best intentions. She argues that intentions don t matter, it s actions that matter, and when these missteps happen, we have learned that being  racist  is such a bad thing, that it s very hard to hear and understand and correct for that behavior, when in fact that is exactly the thing we should be doing, to strive to be better.  These are strong words, and a strong message. DiAngelo s primary statement is compelling, and important.  There are some aspects of the book that I found could be stronger: as I mentioned, the tone and delivery at times seemed off. I realize this is a difficult subject matter, and perhaps no tone would have won over all readers, but for me the tone used was probably the worst possible of all choices.  Additionally, DiAngelo relies heavily on her anecdotes and experiences as a corporate consultant and trainer on diversity in the workplace. Although this is certainly the basis of her experience, I found this central focus of the book to be myopic. DiAngelo s message is much bigger than any one career path or set of racial awareness and inclusion trainings. By focusing on these examples, she does herself a disservice by pigeonholing her message unnecessarily. I also found this focus monotonous after several examples.  Finally, and in my opinion most importantly, I noticed that DiAngelo as a white person would occasionally interject quotes from POC (Ta Nehesi Coates, Ijeoma Oluo, amongst others, which in themselves I would consider to be mandatory reading), however I also noticed that there was only one instance where she actually asked a POC for her perspective and interpretation and feelings with regards to an incident being described. How can you write an entire book about white people s fragility regarding race relations while nearly erasing the experience of POC? I consider this choice to be highly problematic. One cannot discuss white fragility without discussing the impact of white fragility on the experience of POC, and that impact cannot be an assumed impact: there needs to be the respect and the place for people to tell their own experience.  It is this final omission that is the primary reason that I am not rating this book higher. DiAngelo s message is compelling, and I am grateful for the way she has helped me to re-think my engagement in the race dialogue and actions as a white person. However, I ended the book thinking that readers might still be better served by actually reading one of the books by POC that she quotes.  28 book reviews: DNF at 18%.  Some simple distinctions need to be made.  [1] Racism occurs as acts of prejudice and discrimination by one person against another motivated by a value judgment based on racial characteristics.  Absent acts of prejudice and discrimination, racism ceases to have ground in which to exist.  [2] The foundational belief of racists everywhere is that everyone 's racial characteristics are the most important determinator of their value as a human being.  [3] Every social division enables a pathway for political and financial exploitation. People seeking to exploit others will inflame social division for personal gain. Race is an easy 'go to,' for anyone seeking to exploit social division for personal gain.  [4] Grounding our relationships in a deep appreciation of our common humanity enables empathy and compassion, breaks down the walls of social division, and disempowers the mechanisms of exploitation.  [5] The most powerful antidote to racism is indifference to racial characteristics.  My advice: practice indifference to our differences - especially to the incredibly shallow and superficial differences of our appearance.  When I DNF books, I have a policy of not rating them, unless I have DNF'ed because the book is egregiously offensive. In which case, I will assign one star. This book qualifies for this category.  Robin DiAngelo has obviously gone to some effort to validate, reinforce, and generally inflate the tires of the fundamental belief informing rabid racists everywhere: that racial characteristics are important.  She studiously ignores the possibility of indifference to racial characteristics as a natural antidote that subverts racist practices.  Her philosophy defines your immutable and unavoidable race as the key determinant of your life. You have no control over your destiny. Your life will occur in accordance with your race. You are disempowered and without agency.  The best you can hope for is to be aware of your racial destiny. For which awareness you can sign up for one of her classes for a nifty fee.  What a toxic, self-serving ideology on display this mess of race hatred is.  I do not fit inside her ideological box, and it 's healthier for everyone to step outside her toxic ideology and grasp your natural agency and empowerment.  Free yourself from the nasty belief that our superficial racial characteristics are important. Get off your knees and stand upright upon the empathic ground of our common humanity. Break down the walls of social division and exploitation. Claim your natural birth right, seize power over your life, and become the captain of your own destiny.  You are so much more than the color of your skin - do not allow anyone to diminish you by convincing you that your skin color is all that you are.            A post script. Marxism is architected on splitting the community into opposing groups. The bourgeoisie vs the proletariat. Your immutable group membership determines your fate in life. Personal characteristics and choices are irrelevant. Now that all the current crop of Monopoly Capitalists have grown up in a society that valorises wealth over poverty, they have given up the old unprofitable focus on class and and shifted to the green-fields of race and gender. But the architecture remains the same - your immutable group membership determines your fate in life. Personal characteristics and choices are irrelevant, and the social divisions thus engendered are exploitable for personal gain by those who articulate the ideological boxes in which they would force you to live.  The great shame of our historical moment is the number of people who volunteer for ideological servitude and personal disempowerment to our would be masters.  Such behaviour, boggles my mind.  I have come to the conclusion that Western Civilization is a secular religion which worships two gods: Wealth and Power. The fundamental axis of conflict within our culture and society is between permanent extractors and value creators. The primary form of oppression is by the ultra-rich of the poor. The ultra-rich fear, and fear greatly, the unification of the poor against them. They have every reason to divide the poor against each other and will do so at every opportunity. Politics, as it occurs, is primarily a tool box of the ultra-rich to pit the poor against each other while securing their own wealth and power. Fostering race hate is simply an exploitable tool within the political tool box.  This book, and its core thesis of entrenched and immovable race hatred, speaks for the dominant power dynamic between the rich and the poor - and not against it.

ARE. THE. DEAD. Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak \"Double Plus Good.\"  Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I ca not help it. My mind is completely fried.  , with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it 's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.  I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I am almost glad I did not. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I would not have been able to appreciate it fully.  From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.  For instance, he talks about how . It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.  Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.  . The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.  I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that was not the name of the book. In the story, they do not actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They do not have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.  1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.  Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston 's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.  I was not expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I was not sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.  George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it 's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.  It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.  Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.  A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it was not necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, \"Of course, the many is more important than the one\", but when inside Winston 's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace.  Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I ca not answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world 's, and maybe that 's part of the problem but it 's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I am naive for thinking that way, but so be it.  I almost do not know what to think about this book. I am not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It 's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.  Everything about this book is captivating. It 's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.  Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it 's all worth it in the end. It 's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I do not re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read.  3 book reviews: This book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin s We, and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.  But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.  Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their \"alternative facts\" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.    Orwell s vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control.  Here, in the USA, in 2017, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they re stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone.  Which reminds me...one of the things we should do is brood about the enemy s ideology (), for while we try to discern his  ideological goals,  the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel.  Finally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of  Big Brother  may be, the goal is always the same:  4 book reviews: WAR IS PEACE.  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.  Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I have ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.  1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More 's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke in look like sissies.  Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.  The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The \"truth\" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.  The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society 's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That 's describes the first slogan.  The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you will be indestructible and immortal.  Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they will act \"on behalf of the low\" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.  Blimey, Orwell 's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives \"depression\" a new meaning, at least for me.  5 book reviews: In George Orwell 's 1984, Winston Smith is an open source developer who writes his code offline because his ISP has installed packet sniffers that are regulated by the government under the Patriot Act. It 's really for his own protection, though. From, like, terrorists and DVD pirates and stuff. Like every good American, he drinks Coca-Cola and his processed food has desensitized his palate to all but four flavors: sweet, salty-so-that-you-will-drink-more-coca-cola, sweet, and Cooler Ranch!(tm). His benevolent overlords have provided him with some war happening somewhere for some reason so that he, and the rest of the population, can be sure that the government is really in his best interests. In fact, the news always has some story about Paris Hilton or yet another white girl who has been abducted by some evil bastard who is biologically wired by 200,000 years of human evolution to fuck 12-year-olds, but is socially conditioned to be obsessed with sex, yet also to feel guilty about it. This culminates into a distorted view of sexuality, and results in rape and murder, which both make for very good news topics. This, too, is in Winston 's best interests because, while fear is healthy, thinking *too* much about his own mortality is strictly taboo, as it may lead to something dangerously insightful, and he might lose his taste for Coca Cola and breast implants. The television also plays on his fears of the unknown by exaggerating stereotypes of minorities and homosexuals, under the guise of celebrating \"diversity\", but even these images of being ghetto-fabulous and a lisping interior designer actually exist solely to promote racism and homophobia, which also prove to be efficient distractions.  For some reason, Winston gets tired of eating recycled Pop Tarts and eating happy pills and pretending to be interested in sports and manufactured news items. But, in the end, they fix him and he 's happy again. Or something.  6 book reviews: 1984 is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of  's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell 's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision,  's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers. If you would like a better sense of the real world and Orwell 's intents, rather than third-hand interpretations of his fiction, then his is highly recommended.     7 book reviews: This was the book that started my love affair with the dystopian genre. And maybe indirectly influenced my decision to do a politics degree. I was only 12 years old when I first read it but I suddenly saw how politics could be taken and manipulated to tell one hell of a scary and convincing story. I am a lot more well-read now but, back then, this was a game-changer. I started to think about things differently. I started to think about 2 + 2 = 5 and I wanted to read more books that explored the idea of control.  8 book reviews: This was an up and down kind of read for me. There were parts that I really enjoyed and parts that I found extremely difficult to maneuver through. I am glad that I decided to pick it up and give it a go, because it 's one that I have been curious about for a long time. I can definitely see why so many people love this book. It explores a lot of things that we see happening in the world today. I ca not say I am leaving it as a massive fan, but I am sure it 's one that I will continue to think about. 9 book reviews: I am gonna ask myself a mandatory question and say nothing more.  Why the fuck had I not read this book before? 10 book reviews: \"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\"  In ravaged post-apocalyptic future, the world has divided itself into three totalitarian superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. The three superstates always in constant never ending war with each other, and relentlessly and mercilessly purging their own population to align them with their current goals. Winston works in the  Ministry of Truth  every day revising, rewriting and burning history records to match the ever changing version of history dictated by their all-powerful leader, the Big Brother. Secretly though, deep in his heart Winston hates their cruel leadership, and wishes their defeat. A traitor in thought, his life would be forfeit if someone ever finds out, and there are spies everywhere   An unforgettable story about the inner strength and inherent weakness of the human spirit, struggling in the most oppressive of worlds. A book that teaches us to love and value freedom, and its costs; to cherish independent thought, and never letting go the fight. I LOVED the secret unfolding relationship with Julia, their quirkiness ; and I can t express my heartbreak and sadness for the ultimate fate of the ever cheerful and loyal Tom Parsons. Gosh! This was a such a dark and grim story, but overall, enormously invaluable.  A timeless masterpiece and one of the founding pillars of dystopian fiction. A must read in life, along with and . The holy trinity of dystopia. Highly Recommendable!  After a decade or so my memory is a bit hazy but I think I found the  Goldstein book  part quite tedious; hence the four stars. Everything else was just perfect, darkly perfect. I remember enjoying this one immensely back in the day.  Animal farm  as well, another absolute masterpiece. Boy I really need to read more Orwell one of these days!  *** The movie Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is a fantastic adaptation, greatly capturing much of the book s essence. Some liberties were taken of course, but overall pretty faithful to the original work. Coincidentally it was filmed in 1984! Can you believe it? Talk about brilliant perfect timing! John Hurt was spectacular, in one of his most iconic and remembered performances ever. May the good man rest in peace. Suzanna Hamilton was magnificent too; and Gregor Fisher as Parsons was totally on point., and boy did I hate O Brien! Fortunately much of the book of Goldstein tediousness was omitted. Not a perfect film mind you, but a great adaptation. An absolute must watch, even if you didn t read the book.    ----------------------------------------------- : [1949] [339p] [Dystopia] [Highly Recommendable] [\"If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal. ] [ If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself. ] -----------------------------------------------       -----------------------------------------------    En un devastado futuro post-apocal ptico, el mundo se ha dividido a s  mismo en tres superpoderes totalitarios: Ocean a, Eurasia y Asia Oriental.

This changed the way that I looked at ideologies and changed the way I looked at leadership. Cynical, scathing, and not without its flaws, this is still a stark, haunting glimpse at what could be.   War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.   Chilling.  ** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. The scene that I most often think is when Winston and Julia are captured.  ** 2019 reread - Lost in my memory was to what extent Orwell describes and explains his nightmare. Winston Smith cautiously and surreptitiously learns about the Brotherhood led by Goldstein and then learns all too well about doublethink.  More than just a cautionary political tale, Orwell has described an ideological abyss into which we must not gaze; a glimpse at authoritarianism power plays to which the Nazis and Soviets never descended. While we can appreciate the reminder to avoid authoritarianism and his prophetic vision, the idea that truth can be arranged through media is perhaps the most relevant for us today.  *** 2020 reread  This time around I focused on the human side of this iconic novel   especially the relationship between Winston and Julia. In the past I have somewhat overlooked Julia as a character and thought that Orwell had neglected to form a strong female character, however I now think that she is every bit as strong as Winston and plays a central role in Orwell s message.  Whereas Winston hates the party and wants to overturn it, Julia is much more practical and realistic in her rebellion. Winston thinks about the nature of the totalitarianism in abstract ways, Julia uses the terms of doublethink against the party and makes her frank sexuality a systematic rejection of party principle.  While Orwell was forming a cautionary tale based upon his own experience in writing against authoritarian regimes like Stalin s, Hitler s (both actually named in the text) and by extension Moa, Mussolini and Franco, it occurs to me that the irony of Winston s dystopia is at least to some degree focused on the party members themselves. Winston embodies the use of media as propaganda and to disseminate inaccurate statements that prop up the party. In today s world we are already seeing this kind of abrogation of truth in favor of party purity.  Every bit as timeless and relevant as it has ever been.  *** 2023 reread -  I think we all have had a situation similar to this: we search on the internet for something and then we start seeing advertisements related to our earlier search. That seems reasonable enough, understandable at least.  What about this situation though: we have a VERBAL discussion with our spouse, alone in our kitchen, and then we start seeing advertisements about the subject of our speech.  Wait a minute. OK, I ve got an Amazon echo, they must have heard us talking.  Wait a minute: heard us talking? In the  privacy  of our home? And who is they?  The fear of surveillance has risen to an alarming level in the past few years and we can look back to 1948 and Orwell s tale as one source of this anxiety.  I m in my early 50s as I write this and my generation was raised to be somewhat suspect of governmental intrusions and overreach, taught to be vigilant against totalitarianism. We lived in the time of the Soviet Union and we were taught to be mindful of surveillance and propaganda.  But what if the surveillance does not come from government? What if what we were taught was itself not wholly correct or accurate?  A young person recently told me that they had read 1984 in high school in the past 3-4 years so this gave me some hope about the next generation.  As a press officer in the military, I had a hand, as did Winston Smith, in shaping the news and thus history. If in my little corner of history, I cropped photos, erasing some people s involvement in an event, destroying the full accurate record of what happened, then extrapolate this ability at official omission and you can begin to see how easily can the truth be tweaked to match a desired narrative.  This book is as provocative as ever, maybe more so in our strange political climate. More than anything else, this is a thought provoking novel, we are required to think critically about what Orwell states and he invites us, page after page, to think and rethink what we know and how we have been led to know it.  If we  know  something is true, why do we know that? HOW do we know that truth? Like Faulkner s Absalom! Absalom! We are asked to consider our source and to be at least a little skeptical, of everything.  In this reread, I also made notice of the casual violence that creeps up into Winston s thoughts. Was Orwell suggesting that the subrogation of Winston s natural feelings caused an aggressive response in him? Does injustice and tyranny lead to subconscious of animosity?  Orwell describes how Proles represent 85% of Oceania, we see the propaganda and party policy from the perspective of the party, of a party member who actually initiates the remaking of news and thus history. The Party makes up 15% and the inner party is only about 2%. It occurred to me that I m a Prole, most of us are on the outside looking in. Like George Carlin said,  it s a club, and we re not in it.  Did the Proles care anymore? Did they pay attention to the  news  or were they more like Julia, and only played the part for the surveillance state?  I m going to buy copies of this book for the young people in my life.   13 book reviews: I am a big fan of speculative fiction and in my literary travels I have encountered a myriad of dystopias, anti-utopias and places and societies that make one want to scream and.....  ...(with or without contemporaneous loss of bladder and other bodily functions)....  Simply put, George Orwell 's 1984 is unquestionably the most memorable and vision of a world gone utterly bat-shit psycho that I have ever experienced. Ever!!! Despite being published back in 1948, I have yet to find a more chilling, nightmarish locale than Orwell 's iconic world of and . The very mention of either of those terms invokes images of Nazis and Soviet gulags in my mind. Yet Orwell 's creation is in many ways even more insidious than these real-world bogeymen.  I first read this book when I was 12 years old in 7th grade as a...get this...class reading assignment. Looking back on it, I have NO IDEA why on Earth we were reading this book at that age but I do recall we spent quite a bit of time discussing it. I wish I could recall the substance of those discussions because I can only imagine the kind of PIERCING INSIGHT that a group of hormonally challenged pre-teens thought up in regards to this book. Needless to say, I think that this is a book that is best appreciated AFTER your first pimple.  Anyway, I decided to re-read this book recently as an adult in the hopes that I would be able to gain a great appreciation for this classic. Well, the book did more than that. . From the very first sentence, to the unforgettable final sentence (which I will not give away here), this story sucked me in, beat the living shit out of me and through me out the other side a hollow, wasted wreck. I know, it does not sound very cheery, but it is a life-changing experience.  I have always thought that one of the best and most important qualities of science fiction is that it frees the author to take the controversial, politically charged issues and trends of the day and create a possible future based on exaggerations of such trends and in so doing present a compelling and critical argument for change. Well NO ONE has ever done a better job than better Orwell in showing the possible nightmare (and thus potential danger) of a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control.  This book is bleak, dreary, frightening, upsetting and absolutely BRILLIANT and one of my \"All Time Favorite\" novels. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! 6.0 stars.  ........................    14 book reviews: (Book 547 From 1001 Books) - Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell  Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell.  The novel is set in Airstrip One, formerly Great Britain, a province of the superstate Oceania, whose residents are victims of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance and public manipulation.  Oceania 's political ideology, euphemistically named English Socialism is enforced by the privileged, elite Inner Party.  Via the \"Thought Police\", the Inner Party persecutes individualism and independent thinking, which are regarded as \"thoughtcrimes\".           :  1984                1984          (                                    ...)          1982    : 1984 ( )   :      :         1361    272      1364    1367     1369   : 9644480449    1374    1376    1380    1382        1388   789644480447    1389    312      1395     :              :       -   20            :       384      1392        318      1391          352      1389        392        1389        400            465      1396        400      1394        384        1394          384        1393              1392    399          1393    283                  1394    375        288      1384      1385    1386    1388          1386    288      1392      1984                          ( )                                                                                                             1984                                        1949                                                                                                                                                                                  1984  (               )                                                                                                                      21/05/1399    04/05/1400     .    15 book reviews: I know this is a well loved classic and I definitely enjoyed some parts... but some times I found myself a bit bored :S 16 book reviews:  The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.   Just about everything Orwell says in 1984 is a maniacal truism. In some twisted form, everything reflects the truth of reality.  Of course there are exaggerations, though nothing is far from plausibility. We are controlled by our governments, and often in ways we are not consciously aware of. Advertisements, marketing campaigns and political events are all designed for us to elicit a certain response and think in a desired way.  takes this to the extreme. Cultural brainwashing becomes the chief goal. Assimilation into a passionless (and completely ignorant) mind-set becomes the most effective means of keeping the population down. If you can make a man forget (or deny) his past then he knows of no situation better than his current state: it s all he knows, so why would he act to change it? Subjugation becomes normality.   Big brother does this by harsh policing, excessive surveillance and language manipulation. The streets are claustrophobic and the people (the workers) can escape nothing. Every action, every word spoken, is recorded. The police are ready to grab anyone who steps remotely out of line. Controlling language is perhaps the most effective thought control method I ve ever heard of. If language can be broken down into the absolute basics, the simplest and ordinary units, then people can only express themselves on a very minor level. They cannot think beyond their daily tasks because there are no words that connote dreams and fantasy.  Step out of line and you are killed, though not before being dragged to room 101 for torture and even stronger methods of thought control. As such through the plot the book depicts a stark transformation, a transformation of man who was once willing to fight and to think but falls into one of the ingenious traps big brother sets for him to expose his criminality. Orwell s words are frightening because of their eerie parallels with reality. He shows us that we are not so far from big brother as we may think.   Unlike this also leaves much to the imagination. It s a much more successful book and one that once it has been read, it certainly cannot be unread.  ___________________________________  You can connect with me on social media via . __________________________________  17 book reviews: Social media is a cage full of starved rats and all of us have our heads stuck in there now, like it or not. 18 book reviews: I wanted to understand the origin of the expression \"Big Brother\" associated with our modern world, and I immersed myself in 1984 by George Orwell. This novel of anticipation, published in 1949, is striking! We follow the destinies of Winston and Julia in this universe, which is reminiscent of ours or what it could become. Of course, it is a fable, but the images strike and remain used for a long time. After reading this cult novel, we look at certain realities differently. It is a detour that is worth it, a must. Why did I wait so long to read it?  19 book reviews:  If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face for ever.    History stopped in 1936,  George Orwell once said to fellow author Arthur Koestler. During his time in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell observed the pervasiveness of propaganda as a pillar upholding authoritarianism, from censored newspapers to lies perpetuated for political convenience and began to fear that   This fear presented itself across the whole of his works during his short life, culminating in his famous where he warns   Published in 1949 and written as Orwell was , he didn t live long to see how and his dire warnings against authoritarianism would have a lasting effect even to this day, often being used by all sides of the political spectrum as a cultural touchstone. And while this is mostly owing to the broad criticisms showing how any ideology can become oppressive when hungry for power, it also exemplifies his own dread that words will be twisted and quoted as cudgels to fit a desired purpose as truth is washed away. A harrowing story of dystopia, surveillance, manipulation and resistance being crushed underfoot, still chills today with its themes on collective vs individual identity under totalitarianism and controlling all aspects of reality to eliminate all those who step outside the boundaries of orthodoxy.     When we read sci-fi, words like  prophetic  and  warning  often get applied. continues to remain relevant due to its warnings against irresponsible use of rhetoric, which almost makes the references to it amusing or ironic. Such as the in 1984 that uses the novel for the sake of marketing (and what is  marketing  but a euphemism for propaganda) a product that would lead to all sorts of concerns over government surveillance for which people would quote in addressing them. I think the term prophetic often frames a book in a way that causes us to consider how close it came true, which seems beside the point because when we look at the ways it , that often becomes an excuse for delegitimization or ignoring the warning.  Born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal in 1903 and passing in 1950, Orwell s short life left a lasting legacy from his works like being classroom staples in the US and terms like  Orwellian  being blithely applied to anything that brushes against government use of technology and surveillance. Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term  alternative facts  was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people. Though with a president making statements like  What you are seeing and what you are reading is not what 's happening,  naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing   and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party.   he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:  Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel   I feel is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it s your own  side  and don t create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points.  I think there is a tendency when trying to score quick political points that things need to have some sort of unassailable pure aim to them. is critical of any regime that seeks to keep power, but narrowing it to a pointed attack against an opponent without seeing how it might apply to your own political \"team\" (US politics is so much cheering for your \"home team\" than actually hashing out politics, especially lately, though I also find the whole \"both sides\" angle to often be used less for establishing nuance than trying to delegitamize any efforts for progress too, but hell who am I to say I am just as bad as anyone) is more convenient. But even Orwell himself isn t a  pure  figure, having been an for the British government delivering a list of names of people suspected of communism (the list includes and many have observed that there is a strong presence of gay people on the list which makes many of Orwell s rather homophobic comments seem all the more menacing). He also, as observed in his book on Orwell, that he   Which is all neither here nor there, but goes to show how one can create a narrative out of anything, and that is what taps into.  So let s move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier, can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such as when he describes the town as   not unlike because   And one can read in , with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning   as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare   right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, speech and language is very key. Language itself is fallible and can be morphed to meet many purposes it s the medium of poets for a reason and in Orwell examines how this can be used to negate truth and establish entirely fictional histories that become generally accepted as a means to upholding power.        Winston s job is to rewrite history to fit the purpose of the party. Within his department we find all sorts of nefarious linguistic play designed to control the masses because it is thought that   We can argue that we see this notion reflected in our modern day, where books exposing history that can be seen as a blemish on the US are banned or dismissed as unpatriotic or trying to rewrite history (the irony in the latter is thick) and many have spoken on the suppression of queer books as an effort to erase the language people need to assess their own identities. What Orwell is looking at is the way language and propaganda is used to control. I enjoy the way he makes creative use of language to compile entire terminologies used by Ingsoc (the party in control that is pretty blatantly a nod to Soviet Russia) to create a propagated history that fits whatever they need, even erasing the history of entire wars to portray other countries as allies and erase the recent memory of them as enemies.  To step outside the orthodoxy of the Party s version of history is to become an enemy of the Party and society and find yourself  vaporized  and erased from history.   Orwell writes,   and when the truth we know conflicts with the truth of the Party, it must be edited.   writes in her book ,   Afterall,    Doublespeak  comes into play here, where one can hold conflicting opinions in their mind and just accept them, and the Party finds that fear is a great tool for ensuring willing erasure of truth.   Winston argues, claiming that just because the masses agree doesn t make it true, though over the novel we see how the power to rewrite  truth  can potentially eviscerate anyone who says otherwise until it becomes the only known  truth.  Returning to , she observes:  It is in this way the Party keeps people subservient.   and Winston, upon reading Goldstein s book (the book serves as an insert into the narrative that provides a LOT of exposition about the world and its structures as well as being a sort of Marxist-esque handbook, though it only offers the things came to be and never the , much to Winston s interest), Winston realizes that the proles (the working class) are the possible solution. However he realized the proles can only revolt if they become conscious of their conditions and only can become conscious of their conditions if they revolt (not a far cry from Orwell s own statement  ), and worries this may never happen. There is also the issue that a revolution will only put a new Party in power that will inevitably oppress again, just in different ways.     So without giving anything away because this book is full of surprises (though one may guess if they have read by , which Orwell  borrows  heavily from as does Huxley s  and still remains my favorite of the three), across this novel we see a spirit of resistance rise and the forces of power come to meet it with a heavy boot and the power of erasure. While much of the novel focuses on the individual versus the collective, the biggest act of betrayal comes at the end in choosing to protect oneself, the individual, and asking for the harm of others in order to enter the  protection  of the collective Party by erasing any part of oneself outside their orthodoxy.  Where once was the belief   we see   and fear keeps people in line. Reminding the people of the frailty of being an individual drives them towards compliance. Yet, in another way, we see the collective existing because of the desire of individuals to protect themselves at the expense of everyone else: nobody will revolt out of fear for themselves and in doing so allows the oppression of all to continue. I think this is what is getting at when her books look at the need to integrate both the individual and collective by refusing easy binaries and hierarchies. She also, especially in argues that history can never become stagnant and that, like Orwell argues, an revolution will try to uphold power and oppress leading to the necessity of another revolution. While Le Guin sees this as the natural course of history (the double meaning of revolution as a revolt and a constant turning cycling through) Orwell sees this as a constant erosion of truth due to the weaponization of language as propaganda that will inevitably erase reality in place of a false, collective reality where truth is sent to the grave.     One might find to be a rather bleak book, but it is also intended as a warning. There are many minor warnings building up to the larger, main point such as the paperweight symbolizing a past now inaccessible where art could be beautiful for the sake of beauty, as well as symbolizing the frailty of the individual and that we must take care to use language responsibly lest we hold the door for open propaganda. We can even do this on an individual level, such as not perpetuating misinformation (funny political memes are easy to share but dilute the severity of problems when we poke fun at, say, the looks or mannerisms of a politician instead of focusing on their policies) and not giving in to easy attacks instead of respecting the nuances. And so that 's my rough rant on , a book that lives on for both its relevance and its political convenience and maybe we should all remember that truth is more important than winning an argument or scoring political edgy points. I fail at it too, we all do, but Orwell reminds us to do better.    ''  20 book reviews: Praise the lord and pass the amunition, I am finished with this beast of a book. My brain feels like sludge, I just want to crawl into a hole and forget all that was engrained into my poor head. Why, oh why did I have the noble idea to read such a monster? How am I supposed to rate such s#@$????? I believe, like some of you that this might have been better had I read it in a class or with a group. Alone it was fingernails to chalkboard miserable.  After reading this, it just makes you feel hopeless.  Hallelujah, it 's over. Never again, Orwell.... Never again!  Sidenote: I did a little experiment on facebook about this book... I wrote in my status that I was reading '1984', anybody have any opinions? Almost everyone of the commenters wrote how much they enjoyed this book and how it was one of their favorite books ever. While I am sure that maybe 1 of them was being truthful, I have to doubt atleast half of them..... Now I ask, Why do people lie about certain books? Do they think it makes them look smarter? Cooler? Well-rounded? I just do not get it, if you do not like something you do not like it. It 's not neccessary to like it for classic book sake. This might not be making sense to some of you.... maybe you would have to know the people who were commenting, I do not know. But, I am sure all of you have been in a bookstore or talking with a co-worker, etc., and they spout out some well known \"hip\" book that they just 'adore'. You know this person and it 's hard to see them reading period, much less what they are talking about.  I guess my point is, do not be a fake book talker. Like it, Yay. Do not like it, Yay.

Update:  The Sex Pistols, a great British band  Fully aware, of the hidden hand  The entity, that controls, from most high, looking down  Elevated, Godlike, Alpha, The Crown   22 book reviews: 1948: Europe was only starting to recover from the slaughter of World War II. Nazi Germany had been crushed by the Russian army in the East and by the Anglo-American forces in the West. The totalitarian regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Imperial Japan were defeated. Stalin was going strong. Franco was undisturbed. However, the war was not quite over: the victors, Russia on one side, the USA on the other, were now superpowers staring stonily at each other, their hands loaded with a new and deadly arsenal.  Orwell wrote , right after , in this ominous post/cold/perpetual-war context, and many aspects of it are steeped in the horrors of tyranny, dehumanisation and disaster. Winston Smith, the wretched protagonist, lives in an alternate history where everyone is under constant surveillance (via  telescreens  and widespread denunciation). A place where propaganda, misinformation, history re-writing, language and thought manipulation,  reality control  (2+2=5) are pervasive tools to make every individual conform with the  Ingsoc  Party s ideology. The result is a diehard totalitarian state, a perfect hell on earth, where individuality is  vaporised  at the whim of a spectral Big Brother and where even love is impossible.  Worth highlighting in the novel: the long interlude about   (II, 9)   inserted within a slightly incongruous romance episode   and the appendix on     written as if from an unknown point, far in the future, when the madness has eventually subsided. Both sections are stupefying. Yet, the last third of the book is probably one of the worst nightmares in literature: a prolonged torture and brainwashing session that plunges into utter insanity.   s afterword (included at the end of the Signet Classics paperback edition) rightly puts in perspective with its historical context and other works of speculative fiction, like . Still, while Huxley s satire is substantially ironic, almost jovial, the general tone in Orwell s book is dismal, revolting, at times practically unbearable. At any rate, this novel has become one of the canonical landmarks of political . Hannah Arendt possibly read when writing a couple of years after Orwell s death. Its influence after that, on works like , is manifest as well.  Michael Radford s heartrending film adaptation is very faithful to the novel. But my favourite film  free-adaptation  remains by Terry Gilliam. , too, borrows much of its 2019 Los Angeles architecture from  s Miniluv pyramidal building descriptions.  The days of Hitler and Stalin are long gone now. Even so, almost a century later, in a time of political paralysis and corruption, where the most prominent   politicians of the world make ample use of a new form of and ; in a time of threatened privacy and increasing digital surveillance and mindfuck, Orwell s prophetic warning is as relevant as ever.  23 book reviews: Newspeaking ones way towards manufacturing consent with optional mutilating death by torture after brainwashing, because these pesky citizens just don t get to the core of the fact that Ingsocs War is peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is strength police is based on hard, serious humanities such as politics, economics, and sociology.  It s just reality The irony lies in the fact that it just seems like the nightmarish tale of a forever dictatorship for the privileged people living in Western, brave new world, pseudo democracies, while it s painful reality for billions of people. The severity may vary, but there are so many regions and states out there in the world where the  I should be silent to avoid secret torture prisons and internment aka death camps  thought is a part of daily life, an epigenetic standard nutrition kids are born with.  One character struggling makes it even more intense Orwells choice to just focus on one storyline and the backstory makes it so compelling, while the dismal and depressing atmosphere pulls the reader into big brothers surveillance state with its secret police and euphemistic ministries.  Checklisting how much has become real. Even in democratic countries, there is vast control of information, media, and the consensus of which economic and political doctrines are dogmas that mustn t be criticized or doubted. Permanent warmongering with, especially the US, invading or supporting war parties. This is combined with Discrediting even not radical, just progressive, alternative political parties, NGOs, and citizen movements that are too defiant. Good old Divide and rule style. Just swallow it, democracy is dead, but at least progressive, critical voices are just ignored and not killed. Thanks to the  Military industrial complex public private partnershipping the last drop out of dysfunctional, intentionally destroyed distributional justice and eco social market economy. A great problem that emerges from the corporations controlling all democratic European and the US governments, probably the Asian, South American ones, Australia, etc. too, is that they actively promote any kind of authoritarian leadership in countries they have economic interests in, thereby actively helping in spreading Big Brother. Exaggeration? Sadly a clear nope, read Chomsky, Klein, Colin Crouch, Ziegler, Shiva Vandana, etc., all the critical, unheard voices denouncing neoliberalism, neoconservatism, neocolonialism, and globalization. Or call me a leftist conspiracist and trust politicians and journalists, far more easygoing. I should really consider to stop committing thoughtcrimes.  As if any ethical, democratic Western government (or a conglomerate of all of them) would go full economic warfare mode  and unleash fictional entities like, let s just for fun call them, world building mode activated, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organisation, who exploit all weak and poor members while brave new worlding its own population. Or let s get even more ridiculous and call a fictional superpower United States of Eurasia who loves to step over the final border of actively promoting wars for just economic and geopolitical reasons to directly smash democracies to breed more big brothers since, let s pick any number, 1945.  I just love the uchronia and alternative history genre, it s both so dark and ironic.  Similar stuff This is added to my review of Brave new world too. Besides the 2 behemoths, Karel Capeks   dark, disturbing masterpiece is possibly one of the best dystopian terror pieces. It s focusing on the role of big money and industry, of innocence turned into the same evil it suffers, was written in 1936 and satirizes Germans, Japanese, Russians, societies, ideologies, and economy in general and is a timeless memorial against political and economic terrorism and extremism of any kind. Aldous Huxley was Orwells  college professor and they definitively inspired and mentally inseminated another to form these brave new worlds. Zamyatin Yevgenys  We is another, historical extremely interesting piece, although just not as famous and fancy as the others, kind of the same problem as with the underappreciated Capek.  An extremely difficult to read one is Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner  which comes very close to Huxleys  ideas, but is much darker. Some more dark and/ or satiric tones:   A similar idea by the master of philosophical, satirical sci-fi, the great, unique Lem:   Subjectively, I do find it much more attractive that we wealthy Westerners live in friendly Brave new worlds with fringe pseudo democracy and not in Orwellian or Capekian horror visions as many other poor people around the world do.  Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:  24 book reviews: misogynistic shit 25 book reviews: I have put off writing a review for 1984 because it 's simply too daunting to do so. I liked 1984 even better after a second reading (bumping it up from a 4 star to a 5 star) because I think that, given the complexity of the future created by Orwell, multiple readings may be needed to take it all in. I thought it was genius the first time and appreciated that genius even more the second time.  Orwell had a daunting task: creating a future nearly half a century away from the time period in which he was writing. This future had to be its own complex, independent society, but it also had to be the natural end result of the totalitarianism Orwell witnessed in the communist and socialist regimes of World War II. That 's part of the horror of 1984: this future is a recognizable one, even in the 21st century. It 's easy to see how those in control can, through manipulation and propaganda, maintain that control simply for the sake of sating their own power hunger. It 's easy to say \"no one could ever tell me what to think or what to do,\" but the Party 's use of Big Brother, the Thought Police, the Two-Minute Hate, and Doublethink make it easy to see how a person 's ability to think independently and discern fiction from reality can be eroded when there is no touchstone to fact. Revising and rewriting the past to make certain that Big Brother and the Party are always correct has effectively eliminated historical accuracy. How can one think and reason in a society where everything is a fabrication?  Another facet of 1984 that I find fascinating is the relationship between Winston and Julia. Winston claims Julia is a \"rebel from the waist down,\" engaging in promiscuity and hedonistic indulgences forbidden by the Party. She does not care about social injustice or defining \"reality\"; she only longs for what will make her feel good in the moment and only rebels far enough to get what she wants. By comparison, Winston is an intellectual rebel, constantly worrying over the issues of truth and freedom and the real, unvarnished past, but limited in how far he 's willing to push the boundaries (until he meets Julia). Together, they make a complete rebellion--physical and mental, but apart they find themselves impotent to stand up to the Party.  A cautionary tale, social commentary, and exemplary example of dystopian fiction, 1984 is one of those perfect novels that not only entertains, but forces one to think about the danger associated with giving any one person or entity too much power or control over our lives--issues well worth consideration in post-9/11 America.  Cross posted at  26 book reviews: i am not making any point in particular...just that if you have any intention of reading a book about totalitarianism and apocalyptic government, written by a man who believed in democratic socialism as the solution...well, now might be a good time.  ---- full review  I had been meaning to read this book for a long time, but I finally did it based on a friend s (hi Dario) insistence. It took me way longer than expected to finish it, and once I managed, said friend requested (in all caps) a text-message review. Here is that unaltered review for your perusal.  Message 1: I THOUGHT IT WAS MOSTLY A VESSEL FOR A CERTAIN LINE OF THINKING  Message 2: WHICH WAS CARRIED ACROSS IN GOLDSTEIN S BOOK AND O BRIEN S DIALOGUE AT THE END  Message 3: AND WHILE THOSE PASSAGES WERE SMART AND WORTHY OF PUBLICATION, THEY ULTIMATELY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE AS AN ESSAY  Message 4: BUT NOWHERE CLOSE TO AS MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE READ IT AS AN ESSAY  Message 5: anyway in the end i thought much of it was unnecessary but overall it s a deeply impressive work  Message 6: i was lowkey astonished at how long the goldstein  passages  were  Message 7: but some of the ideas there were remarkable  Message 8: i found myself skimming at some points, and then i was mad at myself for skimming bc it s like the whole point of the book, and then i was mad at the author for conveying the most important ideas in such a lazy way  Fin.  In conclusion, yes, I am the type of nightmare-person who responds to texts by breaking up sentiments into dozens of messages.  Sorry.  Bottom line: This was good but I wish it had been one or two political opinion papers instead! Sorry again!  27 book reviews: Yes! This book! Amazing! Terrifying, brutal, intricate, prophetic - and, in one big word, GENIUS!  This was a reread - the last time I read this was over 20 years ago and I wanted to see if the 5 star rating and its standing in one of my top 3 favorite books held up - and it most certainly does.  If this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out, it may not have stood out. But, this book was way ahead of its time. Written in a post WWII era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people, this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future.  This is where the genius of Orwell comes in. The book is mainly the manifesto of the Party that the main character is seeking to rebell against. But, the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way - they are fascinating. The fact that Orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment, but the rules for the new language they were creating, is beyond amazing.  Finally, some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world. The controversial elections this week in the US only added to the intensity of this book.  Read this! Especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia, you must read the fore fathers - 1984 and Brave New World.  And, remember - Big Brother is watching!  28 book reviews: 1984                      (   )                                                                         .

Everything I expected, and everything I wanted never happened. I thought that the political aspect was interesting, and while I liked that part, it sadly was not enough to save this book.  I ve been wanting to read this for a while as it s considered such a staple in dystopian, and in general literature. I ve even watched a school play which I enjoyed, but of course, that had excluded all the problematic aspects, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  This book takes on an authoritarianism and totalitarian government, propaganda, censorship, surveillance, etc. and I thought it dealt with that well enough, and making connections between current day and this book was an experience, i will say that.  Having known this going in, it seemed like something I would love, and it checked off many boxes of what I was looking for at the time. I even had many quotes I had highlighted for this review that I thought were insightful, but my very smart self returned the ebook without recording them all. Other than the ones I used for my reading updates of course, but most of those were ones I used to complain.   But other than that aspect, it felt like a chore to read. So many things that I didn t like, and so many things that angered me. I m reading a story, I want to be immersed, and invested, not bored out of my mind. The writing was nothing special, and the story itself was blander than white bread.  The info dumps were absolutely painful too. I don t know how I pushed through, though barely considering it took me almost 20 days to complete. There was one particular infodump that I especially suffered through, one that would serve to bring up some of these political discussions and simultaneously throw up a bunch of world building on me. It took up more than 13% of the entire book. 13 PERCENT. My brain felt all mushy by the end, and I m not sure I properly processed any of it. What was the reason? It couldn t have been any less digestible.   And then of course we have the characters. I would gladly fist fight Winston, who is our protagonist. I don t care if some would consider that elder abuse, I would if I could. I have read from such unlikable characters before, but Winston is on another level of terrible. Again, must I ask, what was the reason? Why was he so absolutely horrible? He constantly sexualizes the women he  loves  in disgusting ways, and her youth, and has some weird grudge against anyone that is  pure , whatever that means. No, sorry, he just hates women in general. Before knowing Julia, his love interest, he imagined raping her, and then slitting her throat for being, what he thought then, celabite. He contemplated smashing her head against the wall. And those weren t solidary situations. He spends the entire book saying and thinking creepy, disgusting and irritating stuff. I hate him.  And then we have Julia, the only female character that spoke more than one line. And her only role is that she is shallow and weak, existing solely for Winston and his pleasure, and his sexual fantasies. And that is all she cares about. Sex. That is all she lives for, and nothing else. She has no thoughts of her own, and her personality is as annoying as can be. It definitely plays into the whole  women are objects  thing, which of course angered me even more. I mean for goodness sake, the misogyny was so strong with this one. As in the overused trope, which in itself promotes that internalized misogyny. Julia outright says how she hates women. Excuse you?   And all the other characters didn t matter, at least to me, so that neither hurt or helped my experience, but the two we knew the most made me want to chuck the book out the window more times than I could count.  And Winston and Julia together was even worse than I could ever imagine. Not only do they not have any chemistry, just a lot of possessiveness, but they are already confessing their love never having properly talked before. Winston spends a good chunk of the book hating on her, but then when she confesses her love, suddenly he is in love with her too. Winston even tells Julia about how he wanted to *coughs* murder her, and she just laughs it off as if it is something normal. If only this behavior was condemned, as it should be.   This is the most unromantic relationship ever. And obviously I am aware that perhaps I should not judge the book by it s characters, and their portrayal, as that is not what the story is truly about. That s not what is important. But don t you think that if I m going to be following their story, that I should at least be able to tolerate them? At the very least. I don t think I am being unerasable. And perhaps I could have overlooked the characters, had I actually been interested in the story itself, but I did not. Little by little, any hope I had was crushed, and I was bored to no extent, so having to deal with an incel on top of it all did not bode well for    Overall, I dragged through this. It was not a good read. This is so highly praised and I just expected better. I can see where people who like it are coming from in some way, but it was a big no for me. I ve also been informed that this is basically just a rip off of by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which is a better book, so perhaps I will pick that up in the future. Maybe i ll even read for the sake of it, and also because I m curious to read about talking pigs.  ",
    " American Marxism": "book reviews: You are probably familiar with the Dunning-Kruger Effect, whether or not you have previously encountered the term itself. Basically, it is a psychological phenomenon which manifests itself in individuals who are utterly incompetent at a certain task, yet think they are experts at the task in question. I believe that Mark R. Levin, the author of this book, is a living illustration of the Dunning-Kruger Effect in action.  According to this book, the United States is in grave danger. Our cities are burning. This is our last chance to save the republic. Our liberty is at stake. It is a dire emergency. This has been the conservative byline since about 1990, and for good reason. Look out your window and watch the flames engulfing your city or town. Go on and try to say the word \"woman\" out loud in public you will be arrested immediately by the Thought Police. Nice try. (As we all know, that word has been totally banned.)  This book has nothing to do with Marxism, American or otherwise. In case you were hoping it would be a serious discussion of certain Marxist ideals and how they may or may not be influencing American society (which would be quite an interesting and valuable book, in my opinion), you are duck out of luck. Instead, the best way I can describe this book is that it is approximately 300 pages of esoteric block quotes, hyperbolic extrapolation, and Ayn Rand worship, in that order.  Levin 's arguments always take the same form. First, he exhumes a forgotten example of something, as far to the left as possible. Chances are, you have never heard of it, and nobody else has either. He then extrapolates furiously until he reaches the electoral majority in the United States, who are gasp! liberal. Levin then claims that the example in question is absolute proof that America is under attack by the extreme left. There are millions who share these same obscure beliefs, he cries, and they are all Marxists. Seriously. That 's how he does it.  You can use any example in the book to illustrate Levin 's tortured acrobatics. (Strap yourself in.) For instance, Levin reminds us of a late academic named Derrick Bell. What, never heard of him? Levin stresses that Bell believed in some pretty radical, racist things, but does not actually quote Bell expressing these shocking sentiments. A plurality of this book, if not a majority, is comprised of block quotes, but the best Levin can do is to quote Bell blandly intellectualizing on the subject of racism in America. Instead, to prove Bell was a racist bigot, Levin quotes another source; this source claims Bell was a racist this-and-that. Alright, let 's play along. We are told the following: Bell believed that any blacks who were not in favor of getting rid of white people were effectively brainwashed. Today, a few people on the extreme left are still influenced by Bell. BLM is supported by the extreme left. BLM preaches equal treatment for blacks, and millions of Americans support equal rights for all races. Therefore... drumroll... millions of Americans agree with everything Derrick Bell ever wrote, and believe it 's time to get rid of whitey once and for all, overthrow the government, and teach critical race theory to preschoolers. Get it?  Levin fancies himself an academic and a historian, but this book shows that he has little respect for history. To him, history is a file cabinet full of empirical evidence to rifle through and cherrypick and manipulate, solely to support his ultra-right commentary. Instead of adapting his arguments to fit history, Levin does it the other way around, twisting and contorting examples from the past to \"prove\" his points. No example is too tired, irrelevant, or forgotten, in Levin 's eyes. I kept waiting for him to bring up Chappaquiddick. (It 's useful to point out here that Levin was trained as a lawyer, and this is, of course, how lawyers operate they dig through legal examples from the past to find something which supports their position on a current case. What Levin does not seem to have realized is, this method of proving a point makes little sense outside of a courtroom.)  Unfortunately, this is really the only way that Levin knows how to argue; he did the same in his previous book, (another comedy classic). In order to prove their mendacity, Levin took pains to point out that during World War II, the barely reported the ethnic cleansing taking place in Nazi Germany, which is very true indeed. Never mind that the same could be said of any newspaper in the world at the time, since the Final Solution was a closely-guarded secret amongst the Third Reich 's elite. They knew they were losing the war, and endeavored to complete the killings as fast as possible before they were found out. According to Levin, since the NYT did not do a good job reporting the Holocaust in 1944, their reporting cannot be trusted in 2021, and everyone who works within said organization supports genocide, then and now. I am no cheerleader; there are plenty of legitimate criticisms that could be leveled at the , and yet this is the sort of eye-rolling, sophomoric pablum that Levin fills his books with.  Back to our Marxist nightmare. Levin also touches on climate change, and reveals how it 's all just a cover for the \"degrowth\" movement. Oh yes. Levin blows the lid off of this nefarious plot to \"save the planet,\" and the conspiracy goes deeper than we had ever imagined. The degrowth movement apparently comprises a small group of extreme leftists who want to take us back to the pre-Industrial Revolution way of life. Basically, they are luddites of the Ted Kaczynski variety. Since degrowthers are concerned about the planet, that means who also is concerned about Earth, and thinks it 's a dangerous, shortsighted idea to rape its natural resources for all they are worth, is a degrowther by proxy. Millions among us are secret participants in this foul deception, under the guise of \"caring\" about the \"environment.\" They are coming to tear down your double-wide and replace it with an environmentally-friendly mud hut, held together with wax paper. It 's all in the name of \"fighting climate change,\" which is, of course, just a sneaky code phrase for towing away your F-150, covered in those beautiful Trump flags, and replacing it with a Vespa.  Remember, according to Levin, this is all happening . Open your window, and try not to inhale any smoke from the nearby burning buildings. Listen carefully and you will hear the degrowthers approaching in their electric wimpmobiles and they are coming for . The dots were there all along; all Levin had to do was connect them. Take that, Karl.  I could go on and belabor my point further, but I am just too tired after spending all day tearing down statues of Ronald Reagan. Yes, Levin 's tone is so stridently one-note alarmist and heavy-handed that the book quickly becomes a painful chore to read. Yes, the book is packed with filler and lengthy, irrelevant tangents. Yes, Levin either is not capable of paraphrasing what others wrote, or is simply too lazy to bother. Yes, the endnotes are a total scream, with all the usual right-wing nutjob red flags present: you name it. (Surprisingly, Levin shows a modicum of restraint and does not cite the .)  Read this book if you must, but please do not pay for it. (I certainly did not.) This book is obviously not written to inform or educate. It is a tool for generating sales from dullards with a confirmation bias. After all Levin is a true patriot, and what 's more American than lazy profiteering?  1 book reviews: Mark shines a light on all the crazy that perpetuates the headlines of today s media: BLM, Antifa, CRT,  The Squad , Activists, Socialists, and every sort of Equity you can think of. These have become a collective identity and class consciousness that is the foundation of  American Marxism . It s insidious.  Levine gives more than most authors. His perspective is well documented and supported as are his suggestions for how to take up the cause to restore democracy to our country and his plan is very specific: BOYCOTT - DIVESTMENT - SANCTIONS - a plan that has been used on the nation of Israel can be applied to various factions within our own country s business, finance, education and government in order to bring them to heel, to return to sanity.  From there, Mark goes on with a detailed plan to rescue education, (both lower and higher), major corporations, climate initiatives and a start with law enforcement and the sheer lack of responsibility on the part of government to take responsibility for charging participants of BLM, Antifa, and other social causes that have killed, destroyed, stolen, burned   Palpable, personal and practical -  American Marxism  is a book to challenge and give hope for the future if we get involved. God Bless America, please   2 book reviews: It is not hyperbole to say that America s institutions are under a serious threat by a malignant force that seeks to undermine them. Critical Theory is a manifestation of Marxism and it is responsible for spawning movements that want to completely destroy and replace our institutions. If you re going to criticize Critical Theories, it s important to know what the pioneers behind them have said so we can best know how to fight against them in the war of ideas. Critical Race Theory, in particular, is given a lot of focus in this book, and for good reason.  3 book reviews: A commentary, history, and guidebook on today 's most pervasive socio-political movement. In true Levinian fashion, we are taken straight to school on issues we live, suffer, and seek to overcome. This book is painful. I needed frequent breaks. That is a by-product of Levin 's unfiltered style, which many of his listeners and readers know so well.  Five stars  4 book reviews: This was an extremely lazy effort from Mark Levin. The majority of this book is quotations. Of course, if you are going to argue against the position of someone you are going to use quotations at times, but Levin depends on them for absolutely everything. If there is a topic he wants to discuss - Critical Race Theory, for example - he will introduce it and try to explain what it is using quotes, then he will quote his adversaries, and then he will use quotes to attack his adversaries.  Besides for introducing who he 's quoting, his own contributions are minimal. Something like \"Indeed, today we see this strategy playing out in communities all across the country...\" or \"Hence, as we see today, the spawning of numerous movements based on these beliefs...\" are often times, for all intents and purposes, what Levin himself has to add to a topic. At times he would just offer a quote and then simply write \"so true.\" Levin even continually quotes himself throughout the book! Countless times he quotes passages from his previous books.  The general tenor of the book is like someone sitting around a campfire trying to scare children with stories about Slender Man, except the boogeyman here is Marxism. It 's alleged that Marxism is everywhere, insidiously releasing its nefarious poison all throughout American society. Pepe the rape skunk was cancelled - soon we will all be in gulags! Perhaps the most ludicrous assertion is that corporate boardrooms and corporations are havens for Marxism. Imagine, a union busting plutocrat like Jeff Bezos is really a Marxist!  His statements regarding social media were also something that stood out for being a uniquely bad take. Social media do not censor anyone who challenges the orthodoxy of the Democrat party, as Levin claims; instead they actually tend to be right-wing echo chambers. Every day you can see what the 10 top-performing link posts on U.S. Facebook pages are, ranked by total interactions. It 's usually Fox News, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Sean Hannity, Franklin Graham, Newsmax, etc.  I would also like to point out what happened when right-wingers, rabble-roused into feeling like they were victimized by social media, went and created their own social media safe space on Parler. The CEO had to come out and publicly ask them to stop posting pictures of their poop and threatening to kill each other, or they would be banned there too. Perhaps they just do not know how to behave in a civil manner?  In other areas Levin is completely contradictory; for example, when he complains about what is being taught in schools, he writes \"Teachers are paid to teach, and by teach we mean objective, factual, scientific, mathematical learning.\" Do you? Because when the topic of climate change is brought up, for which there is an overwhelming scientific consensus, suddenly we get rants about how it 's anti-American and anti-capitalist etc.  Levin writes comments about the left such as \"their obsessive and unremitting war against the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump.\" Now, maybe many of his radio listeners have the memory of a goldfish, but I can remember Levin 's show before Trump was elected. Levin did not support Trump, claimed he would never vote for him and said he was a Never-Trumper. Levin supported Ted Cruz, who called Trump \"utterly amoral\" and a \"pathological liar.\" Only when they realized the inevitable direction the GOP was heading towards did they both become the disingenuous sycophants they currently are. Disliking Donald Trump does not make you a Marxist, it just makes you a minimally decent human.  Ultimately, the Republicans ca not approach voters saying they want to support the extremely rich and the corporate world and harm you, so please give me your vote. That would not work (although at least they would be honest about their actual intentions), so instead we get this silly culture war stuff. Plug something like Critical Race Theory into Google trends. CRT has been around for decades, but interest in it only suddenly exploded in March of 2021? Why? Because the damage control over the events of Jan 6th was wrapping up, Hunter Biden 's laptop story failed to gain the traction they wanted, and they needed new fuel for the right-wing outrage machine.  5 book reviews: Well written and thought provoking. This is not your typical screed from a political pundit. Since I have a degree in political theory and political philosophy, it is clear to me that Levin has a grasp on the philosophical and historical basis of the rise of totalitarian and Marxist ideologies and the dangers that the United States faces from those espousing those ideologies. I suggest further reading from many of his cited sources and authorities including Hannah Arendt, Thomas Sowell and others.  6 book reviews: Mark Levin covers so much in this book. The part that struck me between the eyes was the fact that an unbelievably high percentage of conservatives self-censor, especially on social media.  Yup, yup. That 's me. Guilty as charged. When I was looking for a publisher or agent, I was advised to watch what I posted online--do not get political. So I took that advice. And self-censored a lot. Whenever I wanted to post something, I usually stifled it. The one time I actually posted something conservative, I was attacked. Social media gave me huge writer 's block. That 's why when I was encouraged to fast from social media by spiritual leaders, the two recommended weeks stretched to years.  I was told not to get political online, but what they really meant was do not get conservative. Liberal authors can post all they want. So here goes. With Mark Levin 's permission, I am a Ronald Reagan Republican, pro-life to the core, pro-family, pro-Christianity. I believe the founding fathers were inspired by God, Abraham Lincoln should be celebrated not canceled, and Carl Marx was evil. Anything spawned by Marxism sucks in that evil. I am shocked that so many influential Americans happily describe themselves as \"trained Marxists.\" That is terrifying. Everyone should read this book because, as Mark Levin quotes from Thomas Paine, \"These are the times that try men 's souls.\"  7 book reviews: Reviewed on Hannity show on Friday. People if we want to save our country read this 8 book reviews: This book is pure propaganda. It 's constant fear mongering is downright disturbing at times. Levin never examines his own concepts of what the 'good' is and just assumes inherent goods in America 's past. He also never delves into his own party 's past when it makes sense to do so. Often, when he discusses groups, it would be quite easy to compare what he says to groups in the current Republican party and its past. The book is incredibly one-sided in its focus on left-leaning authoritarian mindsets while never challenging the concept of right-leaning authoritarian mindsets. He seems to systematically discount the danger of right-leaning authoritarianism. He does not even consider other more collectivist societies in other countries in his single-minded pursuit of individualism as an inherent good. He argues against any collectivization, such as unions, leagues or a greater good of community. In chapter 3, he cries against indoctrination, but then does not believe that reverence for tradition, custom, faith, or patriotism are types of indoctrination. Not considering faith or patriotism indoctrination is a really wild argument. The complete lack of critical argumentation is this book is perhaps the biggest downfall of it in my mind. He never delves into why the 'leftist' arguments might make sense. He always presents them as strawmen arguments and does not dive into the more substantive arguments going on within the progressive movements. Nor does he ever get into comparative analysis on these arguments or why he thinks America has it 'right' while other countries whose policies progressives are building upon have it 'wrong'.  In chapter 5, which is nominally about climate change, Levin enjoys quoting very right-wing economists, while not giving any room to those economists who have since broken down much of what the likes of F. A. Hayek and Milton Friedman said about their economic theories. He 's happy to take what they said as absolute fact while questioning the consensus in climate science about anthropogenic climate change. So his conclusion here is experts who I agree with are intelligent and should be listened to, while experts I disagree with are indoctrinated and ca not be listened to. It 's wildly one-sided and in bad faith. Levin is not at all openminded to opposing viewpoints and sees them as something to discount and slander so as to confirm his pre-existing notions. He consistently calls out the degrowth movement while setting aside and seldom bringing up the sustainable growth movement, which has significantly more support. Once again causing this chapter to just be a full on bad faith strawman argument in the political fight about what to do about climate change. I have heard Mark Levin complain when liberals take statements from conservative out of context and summarize the entire conservative movement based on those statements from a minority or the craziest members of the far-right movement. It 's not a particularly fair thing to do, I agree. But this entire book is just doing the same thing on the other side, he 's picking and choosing quotes that are far from consensus and summarizing the entire democratic socialism/progressive movements through the wildest statements of it 's members. It feels just as unfair from this side I assure Levin.  9 book reviews: Let 's be clear - this book should be filed under fiction - poorly written fiction at that. It 's really difficult to make it through this regurgitation of fox news. Useful to know what the people who are actively trying to destroy our country think though. 10 book reviews: Mr. Levin exposes what is unfolding before our eyes. Just ask the fine folks protesting in Cuba. We do not want that nightmare to come to fruition in the USA. 11 book reviews: Predictably vacuous and the worst of mass-appeal ideological polemics.  Threats to the nation and family, invocation of tradition and an omnipresent enemy undermining  our  society   the formula is simple and rarely fails, no matter how lazily done or how old the tactic.  The book s argument is theoretically sloppy and proceeds in the most basic form, both analytically and linguistically. Luckily for Levin, books like this do not need to deal in facts or meaningfully engage with the supposed object of critique.  12 book reviews: Not an \"enjoyable\" read, but a necessary one. From the introduction to book: \"As Levin writes: 'The counter-revolution to the American Revolution is in full force. And it can no longer be dismissed or ignored for it is devouring our society and culture, swirling around our everyday lives, and ubiquitous in our politics, schools, media, and entertainment.'  13 book reviews: I really want to accuse Levin of bad faith but I think he 's just an idiot. He obviously did not do an ounce of research on anything he talks about in this insanely stupid piece of fascist propaganda. Critical theory is also known as the Franklin School from Berlin and was created by Herbert Marcuse? Criticism of critical theory is one of the main points of the book and he ca not even be bothered to get the name of the school, the city it was from, or the founder(s) right? Hilarious. Idiotic. It 's also plainly obvious he 's read Marx with the same zeal as he did the critical theorists: none. The guy is an idiot who heard this nonsense he 's spouting off here from someone else and just recited it verbatim, just as he expects you geniuses here who are about to give this turd a five star review to.  I would like to point out that the Nazis used the term Cultural Bolshevism to criticize everything they did not approve of culturally, which included everything to the left of full blown fascism. When the critical theorists came around, the Nazis accused them of being Cultural Bolshevist scholars and the idea stuck around on the right, turning into what the American fascists in the GOP today refer to as Cultural Marxism. Transgender people? Cultural Marxism. Gay marriage? Cultural Marxism. Hollywood cast a black actor as a character who was played by a white person in the original? Cultural Marxism. It 's amusing to me that an American fascist would title his book discussing this idea American Marxism. A little too on the nose, though I am sure he, like you five star givers here on Goodreads, has no idea that he 's basically a Nazi.  14 book reviews: Great book by great author. Those who gave few stars must be Dems who did not read the book and/or are so close-minded and ill-informed that their reviews should be ignored. 15 book reviews: This book was depressing to read, especially in the late evening. The author has described in detail, what I believe is the driving force of division in the United States of America. 16 book reviews: In his latest book, Mark Levin offers a scholarly look at some of the mass movements that have swept across America over the last few years with lightning speed, leaving behind a trail of destruction like an atom bomb. Levin did not write American Marxism in an easy to read style. Rather, he looks to the Leftists starting with Rousseau, Marx, and Engels and the modern day professors like Marcuse and Crenshaw who have used a Marxist analysis to develop so-Called Critical Theory Of race, gender, and almost everything imaginable. Most authors buttress their work with short quotes taken out of context or paraphrasing. Not Levin. He gives the reader full paragraph quotes so there can be no mistake about the source material he critiques. While this style of writing provides accuracy, it results in dense reading and may lose some readers more conditioned to quick headlines.  As Levin aptly demonstrates, the modern critical theory movements draw their inspiration from classical Marxism which twists history into simple stories of oppressed classes and oppressors and offers as the only solution tearing everything down. Ultimately, as Levin demonstrates, these movements are based on lies or over-simplifications and are simply a means for some to amass power while, just as all fascists do, oppressing opposition speech.  The speed and pervasiveness by which these Marxist critical theory movements have moved through modern society leaves few easy solutions, Levin explains, other than becoming active in local politics and local school boards and boycotting businesses that have succumbed to crazy political ideas.  One would expect not everyone to agree with Levin s perspectives, but even those who disagree should take his analysis seriously and not dismiss it out of hand.  17 book reviews: This book explains why America is all screwed up. The Marksism belief which has been proven not to work, is pervasive in our sosiety today. 18 book reviews: As expected, this was an excellent book. Levin provides well documented and supported details of the current movement to advance a Marxist agenda in the United States. This is something many are unaware of, but this book shall enlighten the unaware. At times, the book is heavily academic and somewhat sickening, only because it refers to groups gaining power that are unapologetically anti-American. The final chapter suggests what Americans can do to combat this poisonous movement.  19 book reviews: Mark s best book yet that every American should read! 20 book reviews: American Marxism by the six-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, Fox News star, and radio host Mark R. Levin explains how the dangers he warned against in the  timely yet timeless  (David Limbaugh, author of Jesus Is Risen) bestseller Liberty and Tyranny have come to pass. In 2009, Mark R. Levin galvanized conservatives with his unforgettable manifesto Liberty and Tyranny, by providing a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for halting the liberal assault on Constitution-based values. That book was about standing at the precipice of progressivism s threat to our freedom and now, over a decade later, we re fully over that precipice and paying the price. In American Marxism, Levin explains how the core elements of Marxist ideology are now pervasive in American society and culture from our schools, the press, and corporations, to Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the Biden presidency and how it is often cloaked in deceptive labels like  progressivism,   democratic socialism,   social activism,  and more. With his characteristic trenchant analysis, Levin digs into the psychology and tactics of these movements, the widespread brainwashing of students, the anti-American purposes of Critical Race Theory and the Green New Deal, and the escalation of repression and censorship to silence opposing voices and enforce conformity. Levin exposes many of the institutions, intellectuals, scholars, and activists who are leading this revolution, and provides us with some answers and ideas on how to confront them. As Levin writes:  The counter-revolution to the American Revolution is in full force. And it can no longer be dismissed or ignored for it is devouring our society and culture, swirling around our everyday lives, and ubiquitous in our politics, schools, media, and entertainment.  And, like before, Levin seeks to rally the American people to defend their liberty. Loaded with very perceptive views about what is happening to American society and values by those seeking to undermine and eventually overthrow our government by creating anarchy using our own institutions against us!  21 book reviews: Mark Clearly calls out the efforts of those who have taken power in the highest offices  Being Proud of America and the freedom and opportunity it stands for I purchased this book to give me knowledge of things I am concerned about . Mark Levin has proven to be a source of information and Truth for everyone that shares concerns about what is taking place now in America . Knowing the Truth is essential in confronting confusing and misleading narratives . I am so thankful for Mark 's honesty and calling out the offenders of freedom for precisely what they are. Wishing for the best for Mark as he informs everyone of the changes our nation is encountering and what to expect it they are allowed to continue.  22 book reviews: A Critical Book for the Times  This is a must-read for anyone who values freedoms. Levin scrutinizes the Marxist practices in place and anyone with half a brain can see what is happening to our Republic. He is detailed and documented in his examples. The last chapter outlines some ways to retaliate and work to regain our freedom and our Republic. I highly recommend this book that is a necessary blueprint for our future.  23 book reviews: Urgent Book to Read  The perils facing our nation from liberal left-wing politicians, BLM, CRT, and Marxism are explored it detail. It is eye opening to see how our personal liberties are being destroyed. Excellent book! 24 book reviews: It 's sad to see that those who wish to remain blind to reality review a book that they have not read. Zoe and Joshua in particular. I ca not wait to get my copy. 25 book reviews: Mark explains just how dire the situation that America faces is. This book clearly identifies the problem, and suggests many courses of action to correct it. Decades of no pushback on the Marxist agenda has left most of our institutions vulnerable to this radical anti-American idealogy. Like Mark says, the time to sit back and allow this to happen has ended. Every patriotic American most stand up for their country now. 26 book reviews: Eye opening  A must read for anyone who wants a well documented description of how Marxism has creeped into most facets of our society. This book is especially relevant as we are facing previously unseen suppression of any opinions that run counter to the current agenda of the combined alliance of the democratic party, big tech, media and the entertainment industries.  27 book reviews: Contemporary reality check  Excellent and numerous sources support Levin s narrative and analysis. Suggestions for personal ACTION give readers options beyond helplessness and anger. 28 book reviews: When this book was offered to me by one of our engineers onboard, I was expecting something much less than what I got. As I read a lot of the leftist intellectuals, I expected to hear a puddle deep explanation of the left and their tactics/goals compared to my own assessment. Sometimes it s nice to have your expectations crushed.  Mr. Levin quotes copiously from leftist intellectual sources rather than leftist pundits, which elevated this book to a much higher level. Really, it is not so difficult to assess the left when you read the intellectual wing of their ideological leaders, and Levin does so excellently. I highly recommend this book if you are wondering about any of the many ridiculous themes such as gender fluidity, the Marxist Critical Race Theory (or Critical Theory in general), theinsane way terms like  white supremacy  are now used, eco craziness, etc. which the left are pushing. It pinpoints the evilness of BLM and ANTIFA  it is just a really great primer on our common enemy, and enemy of humankind they are.  29 book reviews: The author discusses the original outlook of Karl Marx and other thinkers whose philosophies have contributed to the contemporary Left - Rousseau, Hegel, John Dewey, Herbert Marcuse, and others. Basically, Marx saw history as a struggle between an oppressing class (e.g. the bourgeoisie) and the oppressed - the proletariat, the working class. In its contemporary American forms, this transmogrifies into Critical Theory, as in Critical Race Theory (CRT) or into Critical Gender Theory, etc. CRT sees Whites as being the Oppressors, People of Color being the Oppressed - hence charges of Systemic Racism. White people are the colonizers of North America, they are the Oppressors, and so they deserve to have the country overrun by undocumented migrants from south of our border with Mexico.  Since there are only Oppressors and Oppressed, another aspect of these neo-Marxist movements has been their hostility toward viewpoints that argue against their binary view of reality. Levin discusses how Academia has become almost overwhelmingly ultraliberal, essentially Marxist, and so freedom of speech has in effect been canceled. Conservative speakers are not welcome on these campuses. They are seen as agents of the Oppressors as it were. These attitudes have spilled over into a lot of the large corporations, including the Big Tech companies - Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, YouTube. If one expresses the \"wrong\" opinions or ideas, one may find oneself \"deplatformed\". Perhaps a prime example is Twitter throwing President Trump off of it. In all too many large corporations, if you express a \"wrong\" opinion, you may be fired. You get \"Cancelled\".  There is a chapter on how this neo-Marxism intersects with Climate Change activism. Also discussions on how there have been inroads into primary and secondary education. There is the 1619 Project which claims that America 's real founding was in 1619 when the first African slaves were sold in Virginia and so we have been systemically racist from our beginning. The Revolutionary War was fought primarily to preserve slavery (NOT TRUE!!! says the author). But this 1619 Project is being pushed into the curricula of a lot of our schools. Kids are in effect being taught to hate our country.  In the last chapter, Levin discusses ways people can push back against these neo-Marxist activists and their agendas.  ",
    " Atlas of the Heart: Mapping Meaningful Connection and the Language of Human Experience": "book reviews: I regret the money spent on this book. I bought into the hype and pre-ordered it. I am disappointed in the book and I agree with the critical reviews here on GoodReads and on Amazon.  Until now, I bought into Brene Brown 's self-improvement formula. I believed that I could read her books, understand my experience better, and shake off some of the traits she identified as the ones getting in the way of living a \"whole-hearted\" life. So, I purchased and read all of her previous best sellers.  With this book, the falacy of self-improvement-by-reading is exposed for what it is: a complete dead-end. On the CBS Evening News, Brene Brown claimed that we need her new book because without her instuction about the correct meaning of terms like \"grief\" or \"contempt\" or \"curiosity,\" we ca not connect meaningfully with others.  That claim is bullshit.  The title of this book should have been called \"Brene Brown 's Dictionary of Emotions and Experiences.\" As a resource for elementary school teachers looking for a way to teach students how to discern one emotion from another, it might be helpful. But for grown adults, the money spent on this book would be money better spent elsewhere.  1 book reviews: Atlas of the Heart is a beautiful reference book that would look lovely on a coffee table or guestroom night stand. It s full of images and diagrams and the like, which make it quite different from Bren  Brown s previous publications. When I first saw it in stores I was a little bummed, because I always listen to her read her own audiobooks and thought there s no way Atlas could be translated to that format.  But she did it! In the audiobook, she re-reads passages that were written in bold in the book to really emphasize them, describes illustrations so listeners can easily picture them, and also includes a PDF for reference. Her narration style is casual and conversational. She s a pro at engaging listeners.  If you re still with me but are like, cool, who the heck is Bren  Brown, I got you. Dr. Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston where she studies courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy, and is the author of five #1 New York Times bestsellers. Her TED talk   The Power of Vulnerability   is one of the top five most viewed TED talks in the world.  Her books are often shelved as  self help,  but that never feels right to me. Now self AWARENESS on the other hand is perfectly apt. Her research illuminates the commonality of the human existence, especially the parts people don t really want to talk about.  Atlas of the Heart can be best described as a dictionary of emotional terms, such as illuminating the differences between envy and jealousy. If etymology and semantics don t interest you, boredom will likely set in. I will always read (listen to) every book Dr. Brown writes, but her latest is possibly too advanced for those new to her and her work. It s a great road map for emotional nuances, but not the best on-ramp to the Bren  Brown journey of self awareness.  Blog:  2 book reviews: I am about 100 pages into Atlas of the Heart so far and there are already a gazillion sticky notes all over it. This is an incredible compilation of not just Brene Brown 's research findings, but an integration of research and data points from the world 's top thought leaders on the human social/emotional experience. I love that the book is laid out as an \"atlas\", as we are all adventurers and travelers through our emotional world. The book itself is so beautiful--incredible illustrations, glossy pages, brilliant colors, and helpful graphics to help the reader better understand complex ideas. This is not necessarily a cover-to-cover read through, but rather I have been enjoying jumping around to a chapter that I find that I am needing most. I anticipate that this will be a book that my family references often and we navigate through life 's ups & downs of emotions, and one that I will reference often in my professional realm as well.  3 book reviews: Goodreads Choice Award Winner for Best Nonfiction (2022)  I gave 3.5 stars for this book tends to repeat certain phrases and ideas throughout the book, which can become tiresome for me.  This book explores the meaning of human connection and the language we use to describe our experiences of it.  The author, Bren  Brown, draws on her extensive research in social science and psychology to map out the different ways that people connect.  Overall, I find that this book is not particularly actionable, as it focuses more on describing concepts than on providing concrete solutions.  4 book reviews: I would consider myself top 1% of Brown 's devotees. I teach several of her works in my classroom and have followed her since the initial TED talk. This was a huge disappointment and made me sad to think that it felt like a money grab. Sure it 's gorgeous and well done, as expected, but it feels recycled, which is so disappointing after anticipating this book since its announcement. It could be because I am so deep into her work, but this did not feel like anything new or actionable, which is what I am looking for in these times, which are ripe for Brown 's lens.  5 book reviews: Have not I already read this? Why does it show as unread? Ah, the mysteries of Goodreads. 6 book reviews: This is a lovely collection of approachable descriptions of human emotions and experiences, a must for emotional literacy work related to leadership. 7 book reviews: I found this illuminating and thought-provoking in a way I wasn t expecting. In this nonfiction book, Brown examines 87 emotions that define us as a human. For example, she has some interesting thoughts on perfectionism.  Perfectionism is not striving to be our best or working toward excellence. Healthy striving is internally driven. Perfectionism is externally driven by a simple but potentially all-consuming question: What will people think? . . . Perfectionism kills curiosity by telling us we have to know everything or we risk looking  less than.   I ve spent my entire life thinking that empathy was doing my best to see things from another person s perspective, the walk a mile in another person s shoe definition. In Atlas, Brown says,  Rather than walking in your shoes, I need to learn how to listen to the story you tell about what it s like in your shoes and believe you even when it doesn t match my experiences.   On loneliness:  When we feel isolated, disconnected, and lonely, we try to protect ourselves. In that mode, we want to connect, but our brain is attempting to override connection with self-protection. That mean less empathy, more defensiveness, more numbing, and less sleeping. Unchecked loneliness fuels continued loneliness by keeping us afraid to reach out.   This has suggestions for ways to better communicate with others and be gentle toward ourselves. It helped me think of things I thought I knew in a new way.   8 book reviews: I didn t get a lot out of this. I became incredibly bored reading the definitions of 80+ emotions. I really enjoy her podcast and other books and was expecting more. Visually it s a beautiful book. I don t need another book for my coffee table though and didn t realize that s what I was pre-ordering. 9 book reviews: \"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\"  Ludwig Wittgenstein                                                                    !                                                                                                   .                              .                      :      .                                   .                                .                                          .                                                                                             .                                   .                        .                                      .                          .                              .                                                      .

I enjoyed my time with \"Atlas of the Heart\" >> and I am thankful for her work!  12 book reviews: After my less-than-favourable experience with Brown 's first book, Gifts of Imperfection, I went into Atlas of the Heart with trepidation. The early sections seemed to reinforce my impression of Brown, with the inclusion of many unnecessary, personal anecdotes, a casual tone, and simplicity that gave the book a draft-like feel.  Luckily, around the halfway point, I began to see glimmers of what I would hoped this book would be. The sections on grief, compassion, and empathy were especially insightful. The concept of \"near enemies\" was new for me and (in my opinion) worth reading the book for, regardless of the other content. I also began to appreciate the exploration of some of the more complicated or less frequently explored emotions.  I think where this book shines is in the tiny, minute details distinguishing between emotions that are often used interchangeably or misunderstood. Clearly defining emotions that are pieces of a whole, similar, yet distinct, and those that are near enemies   often seem to be in the former category but actually in opposition.  Overall, it was a mixed bag, including mostly ideas and concepts I already knew, with some gems and new insights that I was glad to discover. If I had stopped halfway through, I likely would have given the book two stars, but by the end, I felt I had absorbed enough thought-provoking ideas and concepts to bump my rating up to around three and a half stars, which I have rounded up to four.  While I am glad I read it, I do think this book could have been so much more and fell short of its potential. It is telling that every quote or passage I marked as incredibly insightful was itself a quote from another researcher or author. Very little of Brown 's original text elicited aha moments for me. And while I am glad she did the work of compiling all of these ideas into one place, I do wonder what this book could have been in another 's hands.

I spent time reading people 's reviews and I found many that went something like, \" It 's just a book with a list of emotions\" or something to that effect. I want to encourage you (if you believe that to be true) to gather a few trusted, intelligent, brave friends and talk about this book. If you only have yourself as a guide then I think you are missing the point. The point of the book is how language creates meaningful connections. CONNECTIONS. In order to fully grasp the premise of this book it 's critical to discuss the book. Happy reading.  14 book reviews: Clear. Coherent. Necessary.  This is my favorite Bren  Brown book yet. Which is saying something, since I ve read and reread most of her books. This book is strange and powerful. She literally goes through 87 important human emotions and experiences and defines them one at a time. It s an invitation into greater connection with and understanding of our lived experiences and those of others.  15 book reviews: This is my first Brene' Brown read. It 's nominated in Goodreads nonfiction. Unfortunately, Atlas of the Heart taught me nothing. As a person who 's spent a good portion of their life studying psychology, I was looking for fresh ideas. This book read like a dictionary of emotions for people looking for concrete definitions of everyday words.  Brown defined words like empathy, grief, resentment, etc. but never shared how they connected to the human experience. I did not walk away from this book more informed. Perhaps, I learned to use a different word instead of angry, because angry is not an emotion.  If someone asked me what this book was about, I would say, it 's about human emotion defined through the finite lens of Brown 's own life. She uses acolytes of movies and experiences to define 80 some emotions.  While the emotions are relevant and important, is not the most imperative element to surround yourself with people that help build these emotions, help connect to your heart? Humans are well aware of emotional variances, simplistic ones like surprise, disgust, and loneliness--but I wanted more. How do we work around these emotions, given the stresses of life?  It 's not an on/off switch.  In my mind, the book reads like a scientific research assignment that I would be tested on. I imagined Brown and her colleagues in a lab dissecting emotions under a microscope, but emotions are expressions of each individuals' experiences, aren t they? We can t scientifically define emotions, wrap them in a box and say hey, use this not that. It s not always that easy. Humans, generally, need time to manage and define their emotions. Sometimes, it doesn t come easily.  Maybe I am not the right audience for this book, many seemed to like it (update: won best nonfiction Goodreads award) It was too preachy and loaded for me.  2.5 /5 stars.  16 book reviews: Atlas of the Heart was my first Brene Brown book, and I can see why she and her work are well-liked. Atlas of the Heart digs into emotions   87 of them to be exact, explaining what each one of means and experiences related to many of them. Even when our experiences vary, which, naturally, they do, we benefit from sharing them with others, it helps us form and sometimes deepen human connections.  There is a lot to take in from this book   Did you know envy and jealousy aren t synonymous? Did you know there s a difference between awe and wonder? Did you know joy has been found to be the most vulnerable of all emotions? Many people experience foreboding joy, in which they lose joy in the moment because they re waiting for the other shoe to drop (#SoGuilty). These are just a few of the things I learned from .  A friend kindly gifted this book to me recently   The timing to read, and to listen, was perfect. The physical book is beautiful, with illustrations and photos throughout. I enjoyed simultaneously listening to the audiobook, which Brown narrates herself. She is clearly a subject matter pro and relays the information well, while also keeping a friendly, more informal tone which I enjoyed   4.5 stars  17 book reviews: 5  Brene Brown is an inspiration. Reading this book felt like a deep dive into a wide range of emotions and insights. For me, it prompted a lot of reflection and learning.  This book aims to be a guide to emotions, to help us expand our language and understanding of our emotional experience. This book was fantastic in clearly articulating and exploring our common human experience. Brene Brown s wisdom and knowledge were felt on every page. She has such a special quality in her ability to validate our experiences and help remind us that we are not alone. She highlights that suffering is an essential component of growth and that healing is possible if we connect with our experience rather than fight it or avoid it. I highlighted and/or tabbed something on every page. I can t wait to read more of her work.  Some favourite quotes:   Language is our portal to meaning-making, connection, healing, learning, and self-awareness. Having access to the right words can open up entire universes   Language shows us that naming an experience doesn t give the experience more power, it gives us the power of understanding and meaning .   I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves. Even when we don t know where we are .  18 book reviews: Friends, I do not have the energy to write a real review so here is a cut-n-paste of my thoughts that I put in a note on my phone as I was listening.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AS AN AUDIO BOOK.  ****  Affected speaking style, rereading points TOO FREQUENTLY (that is what the rewind 15 sec button is for); reminds me of someone like Paltrow and Goop and is probably a monster to work for; went in with an open mind but really it s for wine o clock mommies who haven t had therapy. Really would like to dig into each of the feelings separately (Anger Becomes Her did this; it s not sufficient to have 87 feelings esp if say you re going to take about disappointment and regret and then just glide through others you say you re going to cover). Glib, disingenuous, she s totally enamored with herself/thinks she s really clever.  There are things I liked- the difference between jealousy and envy was useful but then the conversation about Schadenfreude was not- it s not something that has a 1:1 translation into English and her Pollyanna attitude about it did it a disservice. Same re: citing studies on jealousy and it s relationship to violence- I would bet my last dollar that those studies are mostly about men and intimate partner violence and to somehow suggest to a largely female readership that it might be otherwise seems fucked up.  Oh I let my kids be bored bc then they would do things like write and illustrate an entire book about rocks  and  Steve needs two hours of waterpolo on Sundays and communicates those expectations to me  just  humblebragging class weirdness. I also wish she d acknowledge how much of the guidance is a repackaging of AA- staying in your own (swim) lane, the problems with resentments and how they come from expectations of people/places/institutions; etc.  My wife is begging me to stop doing this to myself with this particular brand of pop mom psychology.  Pretends to trust her readers  there is xyz thread in this chapter and I think you ll get that  but then overemphasizes and repeats things like we didn t or couldn t understand them the first time.  Her examples aren t good. For example: her example of paradox: we are drawn to vulnerability in others first (authenticity) but will protect our own vulnerability at all costs. She wonders how both of these things can be true; if is a paradox because one cannot exist without the other. But that s not a paradox when it comes to vulnerability. It 's a condition of its existence. There is a difference between something being a paradox and two things not being mutually exclusive; the ability to have two truths coexist side by side is not necessarily analogous to two things that seem opposite actually proving one another (I can see why this would be confusing for something like vulnerability, which would seem to seek out another s perceived weakness in other to shore up my own position as superior or less weak, but this is maybe only true for animals living in a prey situation and not for human beings in a complex social ecology). The example of vulnerability that Brown uses here isn t contradictory at all.  Leadership blah blah makes me skeptical. Where is the emotion  skepticism?   Needed to not listen to this book. She raises her pitch at the ends of sentences so everything sounds like a question. She also pauses in the middle of sentences like she 's thinking, which is fine if you are on a podcast talking offhand and actually thinking but not when you are reading something. just read the fucking book you wrote it for god 's sake.  She s a liar. I don t believe her claims about memories and things she laughed at. Also I don t believe she s an introvert.  The chapters just end abruptly   Grounded theory research  isn t earth shattering. It s all research. Mega eyeroll.  This book is a Tumblr account Not as funny as she thinks  > cringe Utterly individualist approach to systemic issues. Lean In Queen  19 book reviews: Wow. BB did it again, y all.  I listened to this on audible, but my cousin gave me the physical copy for Christmas, and I m so glad I had it as a reference point, so I could go back and dig in, look at the pieces of art and images that are in it, and just absorb it some more.  Goodness. It s definitely an atlas in the sense that it orients us and helps us map out the various emotions we have experienced in our lives. It shows us when we have been using words incorrectly, and gives us a tool box for how to understand these emotions more.  A friend of mine said she felt like she was reading a textbook, and maybe it s because I listened to the audio and Bren  talked to me like we were having a conversation about her findings, I didn t have the same experience. Because when I tell you I was weeping while driving my car, I am not exaggerating. She open my eyes to all these vast emotions we feel through story, comparison and research. It was an amazing journey and I will definitely be returning to this book again and again to keep exploring and learn about the complexities of the emotions we experience as humans.  20 book reviews: Bren  Brown is certainly well known as a cultural voice, having gained repute in 2010 when her TED talk on vulnerability went viral. In this book, she seeks to give people the language needed for expressing emotion. According to her research, most people have only enough emotional awareness to lump their feelings into three categories. To counter that severe over-simplification, she seeks in this book to define and catalog the wide range of emotions, along with their subcategories. The formula: define, share research, tell a story as an example. Because there were 87 emotions addressed, the book became a bit tedious. Ironically, the methodical treatment of each emotion in scientific manner felt cold and sterile to me.  I do concur with her premise that \"language matters,\" and that it can be transformative to be able to communicate accurately our feelings. Doing so has the potential to bring us into a mutual understanding with others, to enhance and deepen our relationships. But there was an almost indefinable \"something\" that made me resistant, uncomfortable even. Was it the buzzwords she sprinkled liberally throughout? Was it the emphasis on excavating our \"truest self\"?  Here are a few snippets I can quote as examples:  \"To form meaningful connections with others, we must first connect with ourselves. \"  \"that solid ground is within us.\"  \"owning our sadness is courageous, and is a necessary step in finding our way back to ourselves.\"  \"We need to belong to ourselves as much as we need to belong to others.\"  SELF, SELF, SELF  I came of age in the era of hippies, when the term \"naval gazing\" became popular. This feels like naval gazing recycled.  Do not get me wrong; Brown 's definitions of emotions are spot-on. Some of the illustrative stories were engaging and touching. But as a Christian, my source and resource lies outside of me. There 's no good thing, no \"solid ground within\" ME, apart from Christ. Though we can agree on the definitions, though we may aspire to many of the same things (such as connection), I cannot embrace the doctrine of self. I know enough about myself to realize that I must do better than to analyze and discuss emotions. I must tap into the love of a Living God, to seek to grow in expressing that love, and to be perfected in it. That is emotional intelligence, that is emotional maturity: to be perfected in love.  21 book reviews: I just do not understand why someone who has a lot of wisdom to share decides to go political thus turning off half of your readers. And honestly it 's a miracle that I continued listening after in the beginning she admitted that she had such contempt for people who refuse to get vaccinated that she wish them to get covid. She said she fought against those feelings but was so wrapped up in herself that all she could see is how they might hurt her. Honestly at this point I hope she 's embarrassed by having ever had those feelings because that is literally sickening to assume that you know why any individual might make that choice. It goes against everything that she sat there and talked about for 9 hours.  22 book reviews: Honestly, kind of disappointed. Maybe I am just not in the right mind set for it. But reading emotion after emotion was not doing it for me. DNF -23% 23 book reviews: I cannot wait to read it! I have read all of Brene Brown s books and use it as guide for my life, especially when things get challenging & tough. Her books have given me hope, inspiration, and strength. And look at that cover!     mo  24 book reviews: 4/5 stars *Spoilers warning!*   Choosing to be curious is choosing to be vulnerable because it requires us to surrender to uncertainty. We have to ask questions, admit to not knowing, risk being told that we should not be asking, and, sometimes, make discoveries that lead to discomfort.   is a 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards winner in the category of nonfiction. Upon it winning the category, I was curious as to why it had received the most votes, and now I know why!  In a time of climate crisis, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and economic woes, society has made talking about mental health somewhat mainstream. Although much stigma remains for those who suffer mental health conditions, I think perhaps that we might be in a time where we want to explore the domains of emotional and mental health. As in, I think we all want to rediscover how to connect with people, after a few years of being physically isolated from one another.       After all, no matter if you are extroverted or introverted (raises hand) or somewhere in between, humanity is a social species. Personally, I find myself re-evaluating the relationships in my own life, and I think that was part of what I really liked about . I could use some more emotional intelligence, and I genuinely learned a great deal from the book.  I listened to the audiobook version of the book, and the author I think did a great job, making sure to repeat passages that she thought were key. As I was listening, I was often doing chores and sometimes my mind can wonder during that process (because I often find chores just so boring and mind-numbing), so that repeating and emphasis was very helpful and much appreciated.  She did her best to bring psychological terminology down to earth, but I admit I needed the repeats and the asides, so that I really understood what she was saying before moving on to the next chapter, because they definitely built on each other.  So, there are 87 emotions that humans experience. . However, the 87 emotions are grouped together into categories by how similar they are, with unexpected nuances in related emotions, such as envy and jealousy, or empathy and compassion.    Brown puts names to experiences I have had that mix a variety of emotions. Names and language in general provide useful anchors, and I think Brown recognizes this and puts it to great use. I also think that language intercedes to make the mysterious less scary, and there 's nothing more scary for me than peering at the dark side of my emotional life. Emotions like anger, contempt, and disgust that I tend to shove down. But bringing them to the table and examining them makes them less scary and alien, and they are good indicators of when you need to make some sort of change.    This whole discussion was made more relevant and relatable by talking about her own process of learning as she conducted research over the years in topics such as empathy and connection. It made me feel less alone in my learning journey, as there were places where I got overwhelmed by the scope of emotional experiences covered here. Brown is a gentle, patient, and understanding guide as we navigate uncharted waters.    I think this may be a book that I will end up buying in its print edition, because of how good a reference this is. I also have heard how good the illustrations are in the regular book, and I wish to experience those as well.  Happy reading!  -Cora  Find this book and other titles within .  25 book reviews: My first (and last) Brene Brown book and I feel like reading it was a waste of time. It s barely more than a dictionary of emotions under the guise of deeper understanding and meaning. But nothing was well developed and it s full of propaganda for her other books   she even added political rhetoric. Very distasteful. 26 book reviews: AMAZING. Required reading for good human-ing. As a therapist, I live and navigate in the emotions world constantly and yet I learned SO SO much from this book. I will reference it often, and it s going on my  keep forever  shelf. Can t recommend highly enough. 27 book reviews:                  .      . 28 book reviews: This book was disappointing in that it turned out to be an encyclopedia of emotions, a gorgeous coffee table book/reference guide to 80+ emotions clustered into groupings - interesting, but not very useful or actionable for me. I wish the author had taken her usual focused, deep-dive approach, as she had on her earlier works on shame and vulnerability. In the end, I found this guide tedious to read and began to question the value of spending so much time on differentiating various related emotions (stress vs. overwhelm; compassion vs. empathy.) That said, I appreciate that Brown 's goal was to help readers build their emotional literacy, so perhaps these discussions were just too in-the-weeds for me. I confess that my 3 star rating may not be entirely fair, as I did find myself losing patience and skimming portions of this guide. Criticisms aside, I always appreciate Brown 's extensive research and find her work fascinating.  29 book reviews: I feel like I have my own \"coffee table\" book of support at my finger-tips whenever I need it.  I can always count on Brene Brown to teach how to tap into our inner self to embrace our emotions and honor our experiences to build connections with others. This is the essence of this book.  In any Brown book be prepared to be empowered. But, also be prepared to do the work.  In this book there are great pictures, maps, out loud pages with quotes and sayings to remind readers how to address such things as: stress, overwhelm, anxiety, worry, avoidance, excitement, dread, fear, and vulnerability. All those things we face day in and day out in our lives. And usually do not like to admit.  For anyone looking for support and connection, this is a great book to provide it.  Key: find ground within yourself.  Books like this can be added to anybody 's personal self-help toolbox.  ",

XD  1 book reviews: Greg 's mom urges him to join group sports, and despite his misgivings, he follows the obligatory mom mandate and tries out for the basketball team. Of course, he makes the cut and contrary to mom 's enthusiasm and positive experience, he finds himself in a less successful position. The focus is squarely on Greg and his individual contributions (or lack thereof) to his school basketball team. Sadly, Rowley, Rodrick, Manny, and the legendary L ded Diper are not present to provide their own brand of comedic interest.  As a non-sporty, athletically disinclined individual myself, I found Greg 's experiences to be identical to my own. I remember not having a clue what I was doing in team sports and always getting stuck on the same team in gym class as the super competitive kids who knew every rule of the game and managed to suck all of the fun out of trying to learn and play a new sport. It 's possible that this book is entirely more relatable to adults who were the notorious underdogs during their school years and experienced the same type of challenges from peers, parents, and coaches. Entertaining to read, and all too true to life for the athletically challenged team player.  2 book reviews:   It s OUT!

And this year whichever Homeroom wins the competition, their class gets a day off from school. After watching the Olympics on TV earlier this summer and at his mum 's insistence, Greg tries to get into shape and into sports but things do not pan out well. But his mum keeps insisting that he give sports another shot. So he goes to the tryouts for Basketball just to get his mum off his back. He is absolutely sure that he wo not make the team but when his mum gets a response saying that Greg is part of a Basketball team, Greg actually has to play. Would he turn out to be a pro?  A new addition to the series. This is mainly focused on Greg along with his mum which I did not mind. Although I enjoyed this, I do have to say that this is my least favorite from the series. I loved the sketches as always.  3 stars  5 book reviews: \"Over 250 million sold!\" proclaims the cover. Yeah, and 16 of them are mine. I know, I know, kids book. But if you, like me, remember your middle school years and have retained some of your adolescent sense of humor (most males do), you will get a kick out of this one. Particularly if sports was not your \"thing\" in those days. Entertaining as usual! 6 book reviews: I don t care if I m way too old for these book, I m going keep reading them until the series is over. 7 book reviews: SLAY powr t do Dziennika Cwaniaczka  8 book reviews: I want to read this book so bad!!!!!!!!!! But my dad says that I m too old for this series and I needed to start reading some classics  :/ 9 book reviews: I think I am done with this series. The kid is still the same. The brother is still the same. The parents are the same. No one has changed much. Guess I am not more into this series and wouldn t recommend other than the first ten books or so. 10 book reviews:                                                                                                                        ,         *   ,      . .   11 book reviews: this is pretty fun but it 's not as good as my favorites from the series (the meltdown. rodrick rules, double down) its not bad, I actually really like it, its just not my fave :) 12 book reviews: Disappointing! I am a fan of this series , this is probably one of the bad books of this series. Most of the humors were overused. It s time to take Greg heffley in middle school 13 book reviews:                                                       14 book reviews: If you like basketball, this is the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book for you. There are references to preschool soccer, the Olympics, and school field days, but the bulk of it is about the time that Greg spends playing basketball after his mother encourages him to get involved with team sports. 15 book reviews: 3 stars only for my brown king preet patel #representation 16 book reviews: low two stars. the most uninspired wimpy kid in years. rowley is mentioned once in the first thirty pages and never again, proof that mckinney does not really know what to do with him in the main series now that he has a spinoff that paints him as a victim of greg 's abuses. all that happens in this one is a mike lupica plot except the team never gets any better and greg s mom abuses him. was an entire basketball book worth it for a line about susan heffley gettin double-teamed? and does God truly love us for who we are or who we could be?  17 book reviews: Ich glaube dieses Buch geh rt nicht zu meinen Lieblingen aus der Reihe, einfach weil die Sport Thematik nicht so meins ist und war und mir der Fokus hierauf zu stark war. Trotzdem konnte ich an einigen Stellen lachen und habe es sehr genossen wieder ein wenig Greg und seine Familie zu erleben. Es ist einfach trotzdem immer wieder sch n :) 18 book reviews: Have not laughed like this in ages. 19 book reviews: I am giving this 4 stars because I am in a four-star giving mood today, and the book is still making me smirk thinking about it. But on another day, I would probably only give it 3 stars.  I was not sure this would be my kind of book because I am not really into sports (though I do like some sports romance, sports ca not dominate the book as they do in this book), but I am glad I stuck with it because I enjoyed it. However, I never laughed out loud, and I am pretty sure this is the only Diary of a Wimpy Kid book where I failed to do that.  Susan Heffley does not know when to give up, from making Greg try out for a basketball team to making them go to a statement tournament for teams who never won all season, which makes for some of the humor in the book.   I have noticed how in the last book as well, the climax of the story is on two pages, with the picture fully expanded. I wonder if this happened in the other books too.  I know some people think the author should just end the series already, but I am enjoying them too much to want them to ever stop. I would not mind there being 30 books before Jeff Kinney is done or if he continues writing them till he dies/retires.  Anyway, I finally caught up with the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series...that is till Book 17 releases in October, but I am really looking forward to that one about Rodrick 's band. (Recently, I was thinking about it would be nice to hear more about the band, and now we are going to be getting a whole book on them! I want them to become famous and make it big, even if they are not actually great ~well, according to Greg~ LOL.)  20 book reviews: The biggest plot twist of all is Mom being a washed up basketball player. 21 book reviews: 4/5  Sorry Jeff Kinney I pirated this book 22 book reviews: I am a big fan of this series but this one wasn t quite as good. I am heartbroken. 23 book reviews: I know I m way too old for these books but after 16 books, this series has finally lost it s charm. This was just straight up boring. 24 book reviews: Just reading this till my keeper of the lost cities book gets here. This is my second time reading it. I rate it 3 stars   because it was pretty boring 25 book reviews: Greg, who hates anything remotely physical- he sees sweat as a sign that your body is telling you to stop- is first destroyed in every category of his school 's Field Day, then cut from every basketball team, to his delight. But his mother is determined to relive her athletic glory days through him, and so he ends up on a team made up entirely of kids who were culled from other teams . . . and of course, hijinks ensue! 26 book reviews: In this book Greg decides to play some team sports. This was not my favorite book by far I enjoy the beginning but as soon as it started getting a bit too sporty I found it to be kind of boring. 27 book reviews:     review   site  : https://www.culture21century.gr/2022/...                                     .        ,                        '            '    ,       -   ,    -            ,                .  ,  ,            ,              ,      ,        ,                      .        ,                    .           ,  ,        '            '            ,  :    '                  !    ,        ,                  ,                        .  ,  ,                            ,                        ,        .                          ,                  '            ,        ,                  .                     ,                  ,              ,  ,      ,            ,                          .  ,        ,                              ,                            ,                '              :    ,                                                 '  .  28 book reviews: 4,5 Jak zwykle nie zawiod am si  na tej serii B)) 29 book reviews: nothing in the world makes me laugh more than these entries ",
    " Burn After Writing (Pink)": "book reviews: I m horrible at journaling. I hate it, but I was struggling for a long time, and every single person in my life (even strangers on the internet) highly recommended it. I forced myself for many years to make an effort but I just never could. Along comes this book, with PROMPTS: and my sense of self efficacy exponentially increased. The prompts made it easier for me to know what to write.  What I wasn t expecting was that in a very indirect way, this is a self help book, too. I ve started reading some of those but never finished one. So the fact that I wasn t expecting a self help factor consequently got me to finally finish one.  I really had to dig deep for this one. Alone in my room, I still found myself looking behind my shoulders to make sure no one could see what I was writing. You were instructed to be brutally honest, and after skipping multiple pages that I didn t want to answer, I eventually went back and let it all out.  It took my longer than expected to finish this book. I thought it would serve for me like a time capsule; I d finish it in a day and then later on I could see even the deepest crevices of my mind when I eventually dug it up somewhere and reread what I wrote. I hid the book as soon as I was finished; unsure if it was because I was scared someone would find it or because of the shock and slight shame of the honesty in my answers.  It s 3 months later. I ve thought about the book often since I finished it. I couldn t remember exactly everything I wrote, but the prompts stuck with me. They made me a better version of myself subconsciously which I was not expecting at all from a $7 Amazon journal. I just skimmed all my answers over again and now I really do understand the title. I d love to burn this thing to ashes. That person is not me anymore. I am not embarrassed by her, but I m ready to leave her behind.  1 book reviews: 'Burn After Writing' is essentially a template journal of sorts to pen one 's deep thoughts.  Despite the effort to categorise the book into 'Past,' 'Present' and 'Future' to encourage reflection, it feels like more of a superficial chat you would have with oneself or someone else than a riveting conversation. While I did enjoy the questions and trivia, I did not feel like I poured my soul enough to 'burn it'. The questions are a touch-and-go rather than a 'let 's take this question and really dig in' kind of journal.  Also, the author tries to preface certain chapters with poetic prose that does not come through; it feels rather forced in order to prep you for that journaling mode.  This is a good book for ultra beginners, pre-teens or teenagers, and not necessarily those who are familiar with journaling or have already done a bit of it before.  2 book reviews: I enjoyed this book and I liked the self reflection element with the prompted questions etc. 3 book reviews: Burn After Writing by Sharon Jones, a journal which is as person and close to you as your own soul. It has some very intriguing questions and prompts to answer and reflect on your own thoughts and actions.  The entire idea of this journal is to be very honest with what you right and then either hide it away, or burn it. This activity altogether helps you lessen your baggage and also note down your thoughts and wishes.  I am still completing this book, it takes time to reflect on these thing and trust me it is therapeutic. It focuses on sharing everything with yourself and not others which would help you in your personal growth.  4 book reviews: There seem to be two types of self-help/reflection books that are making huge impacts on the book selling industry these days. You have the artsy  adult coloring books,  of which I ve bought plenty for relatives and recommend to friends. And you have the ones more suited to those that love words and wordplay like How to Be Happy (Or at Least Less Sad) and Burn After Writing.  These books/journals/art projects ask you to take time out of your everyday life and either forget about it (coloring) or look at the things that have the potential to make you happy or sad and dissect them. They use activities like drawing, list-making, word associations and many other activities to get you to think about things differently than you do on a regular basis.   5 book reviews: I love this book. I am not actually done yet, though I have flipped through til the end. In part these are just cute and \"easy\" questions, but when I filled out a few pages on the first day, I suddenly lay in bed thinking back to all my concerts, whom I went with, what I wore, the excitement, etc. On other occasions this book showed me things I had pushed down/deliberately forgotten, but now it was easy and unemotional thinking back with all the time passed. A truly amazing concept-diary that I will most certainly NOT burn.    6 book reviews: Questions are very thought provoking but to read the way the author write reminds me of how i answer things when half a sleep. It feels like its going somewhere and drops off to something basic and untrue. Like, it feels very contrived.  ie \"its impossible to tell the truth, especially when writing about yourself\" , \"write something beautiful with your hand and you can be sure it will last for an eternity\" \" you cant look at something without changing it; you cant look at yourself without changing\"  Idk about the rest of you but every example makes me say \"what. That isnt even true.\" ..i swear i say that stuff every night. Lol.  7 book reviews: I did, in fact, read the whole thing cover to cover. The \"write 'I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE CULT OF BAW' in your own hand\" thing almost had me writing \"Fuck off. You are a Target book.\" This was more like a \"grandma 's memories\" book, than something that 's going to fix my brokenness with capitalism--er I mean, make me honest with myself. I did not actually answer the questions, because, uh guess what! I already know these things! And the, asking it to put yourself in a box: gay or straight, Mac or PC, loud or shy. Yes! All of those. I just am! The tone it 's written in seems kind of condenseding and wanna be edgy. It 's weird how many times it 's asked if you \"faked it\". Faked what? An orgasm? This is for people with that Tumblr lifestyle, but I would not waste your money, fam.  8 book reviews: I found this book randomly at a Five Below store. It was a great book for journaling. It helped me learn about myself and what my passions and future goals are to focus on. The book covered real, thought-provoking and funny questions to things from your past, present and future. Great easy journaling book to learn about yourself. 9 book reviews: This is a good book for self help and self care, know that this book should be read/write on in a safe environment and/or room. There is past, present and future chapters, past will be hard for those that have childhood trauma (I know I had trouble). I do like that you have a lot of prompts to fill out and that you can always come back to the book. It gives a bit of hope and you are able to write down your goals and you think it will happen.  -LITTLE SPOILER- The only thing I have a tiny bit of problem is on the last pages in the future of chapters where it talks about your  ideal partner . I personally don t like having an ideal partner or having a set picture because people are complex and that should be accepted  10 book reviews: Grabbed this because it looked cute and thought it would be a fun exploration of the hard questions...  Instead it was SUPER repetitive (even one of the word associations had a word written twice in the same exercise). There was only so many times I could write the same things over and over or be asked the same question before I had to put it down...  No wonder they suggested randomly opening to a page, it 's so you would be less likely to realize you have been asked the same thing already four times... funny thing, first time I did that as suggested, I opened to one of the directions pages with no prompts, maybe that was my hint not to bother...  Disappointed.  11 book reviews: I got this book to try to challenge myself to dig deeper. I was hoping it would be some good writing prompts. The questions were pretty surface level, considering the book said over and over that it was all about asking the hard questions. Also there were multiple questions that were repeated over and over in the book. It was repetitive and needed more editing. 12 book reviews: I like the idea of it, but many of the prompts are repeated multiple times. 13 book reviews: Burn After Writing is a self-reflection journal that was first published in 2015. It has gained popularity since then. The journal is divided into three parts; the past, the present, and the future. The past section starts with a quote; You ca not look at something without changing it; you ca not look at yourself without changing.  This book is ideal for when you need to let it all out. If you stick to the prompts and write honestly, you will discover a lot about yourself, and it is suitable for reflecting on yourself. Many questions, some are basic, such as your top 5 songs, and some are deep, such as what you think is the single biggest waste of energy in your life right now. The questions provoke thought and encourage you to be truthful in either case.  The one question that I easily answer is the only thing I do not mind spending a lot of money on. You also already know the answer   BOOKS!    Overall, I think this journal is a good book for all only I highly recommend this journal for the young generation and those unfamiliar with journaling. This is just a nice book and fun to write through. It is not a diary, but it 's personal only to yourself. After you are finished writing, you can toss it, hide it, or Burn After Writing!  Thank you, Times Reads, for this special book     14 book reviews: Very neat prompts! 15 book reviews: 4.5/5          .                 3                                            .                                    .          . 16 book reviews: The chapter introduction excerpts are so poignant and genuine that it 's quite jarring to get to the mostly simplistic and really repetitive questions you would see on some old Facebook copy/paste question chain. It was interesting. I recommend this to anyone who has never really tried journalling or answering thought-provoking questions about inner truths. 17 book reviews: #recensionsex Jag har #l st och #skrivit klart i denna #skrivbok  Skriv och br nn  av @sharonjones , h r utgiven p  svenska av @bazarforlag .

But this book came to me and I decided to give it a try.  Because is interactive (the entire book encourage us to write in it) is way more entertaining. I also enjoyed the way the book makes us think about some topics in our day-to-day lives. I kept a diary when I was a kid and this helped me to do it as an adult (OBVIOUSLY, I did not wrote directly in the book... am I a monster?). Did I regain the passion for keeping a diary? No, but it was fun anyway.  20 book reviews: I ve always journaled or kept a diary throughout my life, I have even had a few prompted journals but none as thought-provoking and detailed as this one. I really like it and am proud to say I completely filled it out. I plan to read it though once more with all my responses before my parents have a bonfire this fall and I actually burn it. I am proud of myself for being able to be so vulnerable.. now it s time to replace that vulnerability with growth! Highly recommend trying it and doing it over time, it really helped me grow as a person :)  21 book reviews: This was a great intro to journaling if it s not something that comes easily. Some of the prompts were repetitive though and I felt like I was repeating myself. I feel like more self-exploration and  what if  scenarios could have been developed to get my brain out of ruts that were perpetuated by some of the repeat questions/prompts.  Overall, I d say it was a good read/write and worth the time if you re trying to start a new habit of journaling. If you re already a person who journals, this probably won t add much to your routine.  22 book reviews: Let the record show that 1.) yes this is a journal 2.) it still counts 3.) yes it did take me 2.5 years to finish  I wish I could bring myself to burn her but she s practically a part of me now, and how else will I be able to peer into my 25-27 year old brain  Definitely recommend if you want to store words that were left unsaid, quotes you hold close, and letters you wish you could send  10/10 recommend   23 book reviews: A dear friend gifted me this book for my birthday, and a week later my dog ate it. Not kidding. It took me almost a year to repurchase it and a couple more months to start it. Foreboding.  I had promised my friend to give it my best but  the book is very repetitive, pretentious, and trying to be deep but it just isn t. Not a single prompt really got to me.  I really want to but I just don t vibe with books like these  they never do what they set out to.  I do very much appreciate the gesture and thought that my friend put into this gift though!  Also 10/10 will burn :)  24 book reviews:  maybe you realized your  self  is just a construct, a thing you make and remake everyday.  This has quite literally taken me a year to finish. Some of these prompts were A Lot. They made me address things I haven t really addressed before. Some were fun and inspiring. Anyway, I enjoyed this little self reflection. 25 book reviews: <> Burn After Writing is a book journey for self-discovery. At first, I was skeptical thinking it was just a lame diary but turns out this book is much more than that. All of these questions are like a confession, only you truly know the answer and only you can choose to lie or to tell the truth.  If you really want to use this book for an ice-breaking session, only certain questions are suitable I think. This is because most of it is in-depth about your own experiences, dreams, and journey. I did not have the gut to write the answers yet but I did, however, answer them in my mind. In the middle of it, I found myself doing deep thinking about my past and somehow I discovered some old memories buried too well at the back of my head.  Maybe if I ever wrote in this book, I will not burn it and I rather buried it like a time capsule and opened it 7 to 10 years later. I was thinking that this book is actually great to do together with your significant other, your closed family and friends. This will be a great way to get to know more about each other. After all, if you are ready for some self-revealing, this book is for you.   Thank you @times.reads and @putrifariza for this book   26 book reviews: Lido sob um olhar de \"quais as melhores quest es de autoconhecimento a usar em contexto psicol gico e como fundamental cientificamente a sua import ncia?\". Em suma, um livro fundamental para nos (re) descobrirmos. 27 book reviews: Not particularly a fan. For someone that easily gets analysis paralysis, being asked for favorites or to choose one thing is a complete nightmare. For me personally, adding these types of constraints is limiting and not fun lol. Just my view.  There are many prompts in this book, so it takes awhile, but many can still be answered in short. I agree with others than mention the superficiality of this book. I did not often have to dig deep, and for the questions I struggled to answer, it was more of a challenge to my memory, having to arbitrarily pick a favorite, or make a list.  Many questions, not all, are fun little ice breakers, things you might ask on a first date, someone you just met, or dare I say dating apps.  There is very little in this book that would compel me to burn it after writing. It would not bother me to have others read. Or maybe that just speaks more to my own personality.  Not for me, others may find it enjoyable. I am sure plenty of people find this quite enjoyable actually. I did not. And given the title of the book, my expectations were not met. Recommended for someone looking for something more laid back or is new to journaling or activities of self reflection.  28 book reviews:                                                                                                             ...

The poetry world was given quite a boost on Jan 20th, 2021 when poet Amanda Gorman took the stage at the Presidential Inauguration.  There is always light,  she read  if only we re brave enough to see it. / If only we re brave enough to be it.  While I was thrilled to see poets included in an inauguration again after being denied by the previous administration, it was also wonderful to see how many people were touched by her words and suddenly excited by poetry. I thought  welcome abroad, this is the good place.  is the first collection of poetry by 23 year old poet Amanda Gorman, which includes her inaugural speech and so much more as she addresses the social ills of racism, gun violence, greed, selfishness, and chronicles the grief of the pandemic years, asking for unity and cooperation instead of sticking our heads in the sand to decide something is  your  Gorman is quite impressive, accomplishing so much already and this collection full of experimentation with form and bold accounting of the tumultuous present is the spark to a bright future of words and wisdom.          Gorman s poetry is a call to action amidst difficult times both nationally and globally.   she writes to describe the pandemic years still unfolding in the US where political tensions are at a tipping point egged on by bad faith rhetoric in the type of insidious lowest-common-denominator messaging that capitalism thrives on. Which is the perfect time for poetry to step in and make sense of it all, even if I may not exactly be ready for pandemic poetry. And Gorman uses the harsh truths as a reminder to come together in love and understanding, that moving forward through selfishness or  I got mine  mentality will lead only to chaos.   she writes,   It is all very hopeful and empowering, yet Gorman avoids coming across as saccharine by reminding us   or that   Growth is hard, progress can be painful, but the alternative is worse.          Gorman has some delightful experimentation with style and form, such as poems constructed out of a questionnaire for migrants, poems in the shape of surgical masks, or the poem written like the screenplay for a documentary of the past 2 years with each scene followed by the dates and events of the pandemic corresponding to her imagery. The poem reminds us   and in that reminds us that we have gone on a quest of events these past few years and have inevitably been transformed.    At times the poetry feels a bit overly  Go USA , which isn t exactly a topic I enjoy in poetry, but I see the reasoning and it comes across as patriotic rather than nationalist and Gorman addresses many systemic issues that are plaguing the country.   she asks, and much of the book examines the way racism and violence has wormed its way into the heart of the country as she pleads with us to examine it and undo it. Something I particularly enjoy about her analysis is her attention to the way language and rhetoric become the barbs through which social ills latch on in order to infect. Poems like , which is structured in columns like a newspaper, discuss historical events like the  Spanish Influenza , pointing out it did not actually originate in Spain (she mentions the Spanish called it the French flu).   she writes as the poem discusses how fearmongering and language are used to oppress and Other people. Jim Crow, the Chinese Exclusion Act and more are addressed in a poem that calls for speaking out, speaking true, and to respect the power of language.          ' -from What We Carry  Language can harm, but it can also heal, and Gorman captures this duality well in her first collection of poetry. is an interesting literary artifact of the present that chronicles the discourse and troubles of the United States over the recent years into a plea for better action, better times and better understanding. While it will inevitably be politicized on party lines because that 's what trolls do in place of a personality, it doesn t have to be and certainly doesn t read that way. For newcomers to poetry who like what they see here I d like to recommend some favorites such as , or the absolute greatest, , who you will certainly find more to examine and enjoy. Amanda Gorman is a bright young woman with a shining career ahead of her and I am happy to see it and watch how she has brought poetry into the hearts of many.           1 book reviews: \"Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried.\"  Damn. I love this poem. 2 book reviews:  words matter, for language is an ark. yes, language is an art  language is a life craft. yes, language is a life raft.   i, like most people, first heard and were inspired by AG when she delivered her inauguration poem,  the hill we climb,  back in january. i was captivated by her words and was so excited to hear she would be releasing a collection.  and let me tell you what. this collection is massive - there are 70 poems in this! and while reading, i discovered the same thing i always do when i pick up a poetry book - there are some entries that i adore and relate to more than others.      and also, with this collection specifically, i think i would have liked a lot more of the poems better had i listened to this, rather then read it. i think AGs poetry has power in her unique delivery. i feel like, because im missing out on the cadence and intonation of her words, a lot of the poems just didnt have a natural flow to them.  so 4 stars for now, because i really did enjoy the content of the majority of her poetry. but i have a feeling once i get my hands on an audiobook, it will probably get a bump up.   3 book reviews: Winner: Goodreads Choice Awards 2022 - Best Poetry I do not usually vote in the awards, as I do not read enough new and popular books, but I am pleased this collection has won. I was given it for Christmas 2021, and loved it:    This book, like a ship, is meant to be lived in.  - from  Another Nautical  I became aware of Gorman when she her poem  The Hill We Climb  at Biden 's inauguration. This is a collection of recent poems that vary in form, but overlap in subjects: the Covid pandemic (though rarely named) and the historic and current experience of African Americans (from slavery to BLM) wax and wane and sometimes intersect. The final poem is the first one most of us encountered.   - from  Ship s Manifest   Her voice is insightful, informative, consistent, potent, playful, and kind. Always, there is hope, but not in an empty or sentimental way. It 's claimed assertively.     - from  In the Deep   I m glad I read these in sequence, spread over several weeks, rather than dipping in at random, because there is a broader arc that adds strength to Gorman s message of hope.    There are literary allusions (explained in detailed notes), and her style is distinct, even in the many different forms and formats.  All the writing is poetic, though she 's more inclined to wordplay that is not really rhyme (sick of home... homesick; more akin... to kin; no better compass than compassion; loss... lost; fractured  fractal, and homophones like wail/whale, allowed/aloud, and profit/prophet). She always uses ampersands, rather than  and . Some of the pieces would not be poems in most people 's eyes, a few definitely are, but most are in the liminal space between. There are shape poems, essays, pieces with missing words, reworkings of historical documents, and the odd near-joke.       -  Roses    :    Gorman follows her history teacher s advice to write her ghosts, rather than running away from them. She explores individual and societal trauma, often indirectly: the many ways history s echoes scratch fresh scars to this day, and how pandemic restrictions have affected us. Seas and trees too.     - from  Good Grief   As a white Brit, I related more to the Covid and lockdown poems, but I was often more moved by the ones about black experiences.      - from  _____[Gated]   It s prophetic, too. Five days after Russia invaded Ukraine, it has extra power.       - from  The Truth of One Nation     It is perhaps unfair to cite snippets of crafted art, but anyway:   March shuddered into a year, Sloshing with millions of lonely, An overcrowded solitude.  - from  At First    This edgeless doubt: Every cough seemed catastrophe, Every proximate person a potential peril.  - from  Fugue    There is power in being robbed & still choosing to dance.  - from  School s Out    It s not what was done that will haunt us, But what was withheld.  - from  In the Deep    We stalked ourselves for days in our own house, Absolutely abulic, incessantly incensed.    It 's said that ignorance is bliss. Ignorance is this: a vine that sneaks up a tree, killing not by poison, but by blocking out its Light.  - from  Vale of the Shadow of Death or Extra! Extra! Read All About It!    The first step in warfare & pandemics is the same: Isolation  The second step in warfare & pandemics Is the same: continuation.  - from  War: What, is it Good?    Grief, like glass, can be both a mirror and a window  We become a window pain.  - from  Report on Migration of Roes    One nation under guns  Scars and stripes  One nation, under ghosts.  - from  The Truth of One Nation    Words matter, for Language is an ark. Yes, Language is an art, An articulate artifact. Language is a life craft. Yes, Language is a life raft.  - from  What We Carry    is the final poem in this collection. See my short review .  : ()  4 book reviews: They just get better and better with time 5 book reviews: Wow! Words ca not adequately describe my reaction to Amanda Gorman 's poetry in Call Us What We Carry.  Gorman is the youngest presidential inaugural poet in US history, and she stunned the world with her poem, The Hill We Climb, during the inauguration of President Joe Biden.  The poems in her book capture the time, terror and feelings during the global pandemic (both during the Spanish Flu in 1918 and the COVID pandemic in 2020) and centuries of system racial discrimination including the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many others.  Some of the memorable poetry passages include:  * Unprecedented and unpresidented  * Frayed and afraid  * Our souls, solitary and solemn  * Alive but alone  * Our scars are the brightest part of us  * Isolation is its own climate  * Trauma is like a season; deep and dependable  * Pre-memory determines who we are as a people  * Storytelling is a way that unarticulated memory becomes an art  * Grief is the grenade that always goes off  * The Spanish influenza did not originate in Spain. The first recorded case was in Kansas. Spain was neutral in World War I.  * Ignorance is a vine that sneaks up a tree and blocks out the light  * Courage must cost something, or else it is worth nothing at all  * Isolation is the first step in war and pandemics  * A virus separates us from people  * Hate is a virus  * Hate only survives when hosted in humans  * Never forget that to be alone has always been a price for some and a privilege for others  * Who were we beneath our mask?  * Language is a life craft. Language is a life raft.  Highly, highly recommend!  6 book reviews: Now a Goodreads Choice Nominee in Poetry!!   We have learned that quiet is not always peace, and the norms and notions of what  just  is is not always justice.   I listened to the audiobook of Call Us What We Carry read by the author, Amanda Gorman. I absolutely recommend going this route as nobody will have a better handle on the content and know where to place inflections more than the person who crafted it. I was also surprised to learn Gorman had a speech impediment growing up, because she spoke clearly, confidently and beautifully while reciting her poems.  *insert usual disclaimer of knowing nothing about poetry*  But really, this is the wrong review to read if you want smart technical analysis. All I can offer is some of the topics covered and highly recommend it to anyone who asks. That s probably for the best regardless of who is writing about , though, as I think Gorman s words are best left standing on their own.  The first half is a lot of reflecting on the past nearly two years during the pandemic, especially as a young woman living in America. You can hear generational markers in her words and tone, and some of the relentless idealism Gen Z is known for. The second half then moves toward what happened during the George Floyd protests last summer, but also more broadly covering race, the Trump presidency (though never by name), and a call to action for issues like climate change. Her delivery is sharp and smart, breathing new life into discourse that s well broken-in at this point.    The book ends on a hopeful note, with the famous inaugural poem . Still, even before then Gorman does her best to pick us up off of the floor, deeply longing but still believing in a possibility for a better world. I can t say I always share Gorman s optimism. While we are losing the fight to keep yet another generation from plunging into insurmountable student loan/medical debt and debating whether senior citizens deserve to have teeth. While natural disasters and infectious diseases that could have been mitigated are free to rip through vulnerable communities. While our politicians (yes, including democrats) remain bought and paid for ideologues to corporate interests.    Sure, but  what stands before us  might be too much at this point for just  who stands beside us  to handle on our own. Here s hoping that people who helped create these problems actually step up to solve them instead of pinning all their hopes on a number of courageous 23-year-olds.  7 book reviews: What an astounding collection of poems! Amanda Gorman is brilliant and insightful, and writes with so much clarity and passion. Her way with words is playful and yet oh so impactful.  Young people like her give me hope for this world. 8 book reviews: I feel this collection was rushed because Gorman 's impressive performance at the inauguration gained the attention of the general public which was a great disservice to the poet. A number of the poems felt like workshop exercises. 9 book reviews: Amanda Gorman, the young girl who upstaged Joe Biden s Inauguration Day with her brilliance and beauty   making many of us around the world  gasp-in-awe   .. gives us a  Call Us What We Carry: Poems ..  . formally called  The Hill We Climb and Other Poems ..

Personally   I d suggest the PHYSICAL book  . over the Kindle   10 book reviews: 4.5/5 stars  Amanda Gorman has got me into poetry again! Call Us What We Carry is a collection of poetry by the youngest poet ever to give an inaugural poetry reading. The poem she recited at President Biden s inauguration in January 2021, The Hill We Climb, first catapulted her into international fame, and I can see why!  features  The Hill We Climb  among many other poems that cover the complexities of human experience from grief to mental health to collective healing to social movements as people grapple with the existential questions raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is a tough slate of topics to handle, but Gorman does it with her usual finesse and grace. There are poetic structures I recognize from my literature classes, such as the haiku, but Gorman also throws in quite a bit of freestyle.  By that, I mean she not only explores the boundaries of poetic expression, but depicts her poetry in a variety of mediums, from shapes to addendums to actual historical documents. (For the record, I had no idea that shape poetry existed until now. I find it intriguing, albeit a bit difficult orientation-wise when reading!) My favorite shape poem took the shape of a whale, but I figure others may have a different opinion.  I think some of my favorite lines, which express how joy can still come through, even in the most trying of circumstances, are:              I think it speaks to the resilience of human beings when we feel like we ve been pushed to our limits. I found during the lockdowns that any opportunity to do something that brought me joy was essential in keeping me going. More than ever.  It may sound clich , or even common sense, but it was very true. And Gorman could express clich s in ways that didn t even sound clich  (if that makes sense)!  Recognizing that not everyone is into poetry, I still would highly recommend giving a chance. It is challenging, but rewards those who persevere.  -Cora    Find this book and other titles within .  11 book reviews: I was really looking forward to reading this, especially after all the hype from her presenting at the inauguration. What I found was a bunch of repetitive lines that could have been written by any of my students. I was surprised when I Googled her age and found her to be 23 years old. I had assumed she was in high school, which is why I did not judge the poetry too harshly initially. This book is filled with too many previous accounts of past pandemics, from the Spanish Infulenza to slavery and wars, to be considered original content. She simply restates and lists historical documents and re-words them with a rhyme scheme. Any of my 8th grade students could do that. Maybe it 's because I listened to the audiobook and did not read the words printed on an actual page. I will give it that, but I waited for four hours of \"poetry\" for even one line to stand out to me as quote-worthy or notable or deep or touching... and none ever did. With the way she is lauded, I was expecting something more akin to Jamaica Kincaid, Maya Angelou or Langston Hughes. What I got was a sloppy attempt at mashing words together with overused alliteration and unrhythmic lines. (for example: \"This book is awake. This book is a wake.\" I mean... really?) There are plenty of good ideas in this book, and you can tell Gorman is authentic and has a genuine voice to her. However, it is evident that this book was rushed after her newfound fame, as a cash-grab. It feels very thrown together and haphazard. Reflections on a pandemic that is very much NOT over, feels a bit premature and assumptive. The entire first half was simply reciting statistics and facts that we are all too familiar with already. Like I mentioned previously, it 's nothing new. In fact, it 's weary and dull. It felt very much like a high school student desperately copy/pasting citations from Wikipedia to fulfill a word count limit. I tell my students all the time, I want to hear what YOU think, not what the internet thinks. Every other page was a constant interruption of thought to insert a definition or clarify what she meant. Rule number 1 in creative writing: Do not make the assumption that your reader is stupid. Say what you mean in any eloquent way you wish, and those who get it will \"get it\" and those who do not can go look it up themselves. Using way too many interruptions broke my interest and left me feeling frustrated that she felt the need to clarify things I already knew. Most of her literary references were fairly common and recognizable, yet she broke her poem 's rhythm over and over just to \"insert reference here just in case you did not know what I was talking about.\" Put a footnote if you really want to educate your audience, but do not assume (as a 23 year old) that your readers wo not have a clue what you are referring to. Many of these poems felt like responses to a creative writing college class prompt and not a fresh original idea naturally inspired. Her use of words like \"Zoombies\" is cringe-worthy in an era we are still living through and comes off as out-of-touch and juvenile. I wish I could like this, and went into it with relatively high hopes. Sad to see her publishers pushing for more content. I would be interested in reading more natural work from her later in her career.  12 book reviews: I m not a poetry person, but this collection has some definite winners.  Here are the poems/lines that really stood out to me (in order of their appearance):  Ship s Manifest  To be accountable we must render an account: Not what was said, but what was meant.   Fugue  This is edgeless doubt: Every cough seemed catastrophe, Every proximate person a potential peril. We mapped each sneeze & sniffle, Certain the virus we had run away from Was now running through us. We slept the days down. We wept the year away, Frayed & afraid.   School s Out  There is power in being robbed & still choosing to dance.   There s No Power Like Home  We were sick of home, Home sick. That mask around our ear Hung itself into the year.   The Shallows  Shall this leave us bitter? Or better? Grieve. Then choose.   & So  Since the world is round, There is no way to walk away From each other, for even then We are coming back together.   Good Grief (I love this whole poem)  Essex I  We were told never to use I when writing, because eliminating this voice makes arguments legitimate.  (Side note: I recommend reading , which is tied to the subject of this poem)  Another Nautical  There truly is a unity That requires no  they  For us to be threatened by.   In the Deep (Again, loved this entire poem)  Hephaestus  Pay attention. Concern is the debt We always owed each other.   Cordage, or Atonement  Our gods owe men omens. Answers, we mean.   Lucent  Glossy scabs, tight-raised skin, These can look silver in certain moonlights. In other words, Our scars are the brightest Parts of us.   Life (Again, loved this entire poem)  Alarum (Again, loved this entire poem)  Vale of the Shadow of Death  It s said that ignorance is bliss. Ignorance is this: a vine that sneaks up a tree, killing not by poison, but by blocking out its light.   _ _ _ _ _ [Gated] (Again, loved this entire poem)  Fury & Faith (Again, loved this entire poem)  The Truth in One Nation (Again, loved this entire poem)  The Hill We Climb (The inauguration poem she s known for)   There were of course parts of this collection that I did not care for:      13 book reviews: Call Us What We Carry is a beautiful book of poetry by Amanda Gorman that I will read again and again. While I am sure that I was not the only one, I was spellbound during the inauguration of President Joseph Biden on January 20, 2021, when a beautifully poised young woman came on to the stage in a lovely yellow coat with a striking red headband. She was our poet laureate Amanda Gorman and reciting her beautiful poem, The Hill We Climb. Gorman 's striking poetry throughout this book is rife with alliteration, homonyms, and synonyms leaving bare the raw truths of our lives that will leave one in awe of how perceptive her poetry is.      This was a beautiful book that speaks to the history of our nation with a lot of emphasis on pandemics and civil rights, but at its heart are the truths that we all strive for in our efforts to build a better world as we are confronted with grief and loss.   14 book reviews: AWESTRUCK CRITIQUE:  What a poem! What a performance!  Poem  https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/20/po...                  For me, Amanda Gorman 's \"The Hill We Climb\" Called to mind Allen Ginsberg 's \"Howl\", Only she was not looking for an angry fix, But once she was woke and risen, Ready, willing and able to share it, She sought to raise this wounded world Into a wondrous one, By doing what is needed to repair it.  15 book reviews: Every time I hear praises for Amanda Gorman, I wonder if I m reading the same so-called  poems?   The reviews glow about this tripe as if its  The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock.  You d think Gorman was the next T.S. Eliot or Alexander Pushkin or Sylvia Plath or Seamus Heaney. I LOVE poetry, so try to give it a chance. But when I see crap like  unprecedented & unpresidented,  I don t get inspired to do anything but gag. I literally had to wash my mouth after reading:  This book is awake. This book is a wake.  That is garbage, verbal diarrhea, and not poetry.  Gorman s  poetry  is juvenile at best. It s like a slightly catchy little commercial jingle being hailed as an operatic masterpiece. I remember hearing better poetry in my 9th grade Honors English class. Please make it stop!  I ve come to the conclusion that most of the people praising this junk don t know or like real poetry. Gorman makes them feel smart and literary and that s what they like. There s no other explanation....  16 book reviews: Oh goodness. I really wanted to like this collection from Gorman, but I just couldn t.  It s all written in a collective  we  about the pandemic, which removes all nuance from the perspective. It makes sweeping generalizations about how we all felt, when many of us may have had many different and conflicting feelings. It also reads to me a bit as hope porn trying SO HARD to find lessons in the grief and pain of the last 2 years, in a way that doesn t ring true (to me at least).  I nearly lost it when I got to the poem that is literally just a few lines from Hamilton    The themes are important but I found the meditations on them hollow. Lots of big, intellectual words to explore abstract concepts. It all felt impersonal and forced. There was also a poem shaped like a face mask.  I guess I just never wanted a pandemic poetry collection, lol. But to each their own.  17 book reviews: Amanda Gorman 's poems in this collection are very timely to our current moment of pandemic and racial inequality. At one point I thought it was too much but when you get half way in the book, Gorman starts to be more creative and experimental. She uses historical documents from a century ago to make poems and connects that time to our present moment. She does a great job with her use of images and different poem styles. It keeps you engaged and also convicted. She challenges you to think her poems are about one thing but they are about something totally different. Amazing for her first collection. I am looking forward to what she writes next.  18 book reviews: My friend gave me this book. She said she is not a reader. I always find that hard to understand. 19 book reviews: 4.5 - WOW, totally in awe of this young woman 's gift! I have heard her read her work before & knew it was moving, but was so blown away by both the poetry itself, as well as it 's visual presentation! I also did not realize how very, very current this collection is, with so much of it discussing the collective events of the last two years, but with call backs to earlier pandemics and other social issues. An quick read, but one that really made me think more about issues, highly recommend! 20 book reviews: 3.5 stars  I will preface this by saying I m not a huge poetry person, but I try to go out of my comfort zone occasionally and read genres that I do not always read. Some of these poems were great. I ve heard Amanda Gorman read her poetry live and she does an amazing job, but for some reason, it did not come across well narrating this audiobook. I usually love listening to books narrated by the author but I think that I would have enjoyed this more if I would have read it, the narration threw me off.        21 book reviews: Favorite lines from FUGUE: There was another gap that choked us: The simple gift of farewell. Goodbye, by which we say to another  Thanks for offering your life into mine. By Goodbye, we truly mean: Let us be able to say hello again.  Favorite lines from IN THE DEEP: For a year our television was a lighthouse, blinking Only in warning and never in warmth  Favorite lines from SURVEY: Grief, like glass, can be both a mirror and a window, enabling us to look both in and out, then and now and how. In other words we become a window pain. Only somewhere in loss do we find the grace to gaze up and out of ourselves.  22 book reviews: For Juneteenth Day , I was fortunate to find a Ted Talk by Amanda Gorman. I Adore Her. To me She Speaks so Beautifully and with Such Grace. Her words inspire me. I am so glad she is part of our new generation. Stunning and Incredible     They Buried Us, But Did Not Know We Were Seeds ~That s Poetry      I often refer back to this book, it s incredible.  I often listen to her famous poem, The Hill We Climb. Every time I feel like things are too much, listening to her speak gives me Hope. It is Beautiful the way it changes my Feelings. Be Brave, We Together Can Do This     When Day Comes, we step out of the shade, Aflame and Unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, If only we re brave enough to see it. If only we re brave enough to be it.   This is Our Future.  23 book reviews: I enjoyed some of the poems in this collection and others I found unbearably didactic. Gorman 's style seems more geared towards spoken performance, which probably gives this collection a bit of a disadvantage. I liked many of the found poems, which makes sense because those are designed to be read on the page. It always makes me anxious when artists get famous at a young age (Gorman is 23) because that kind of scrutiny can be really damaging, so I hope that she had a long career and is able to change and grow creatively.  24 book reviews: I admire Amanda Gorman 's talent and I sincerely hope many young people start writing because of her. Having said that, I have to be honest to myself here and give 2.5 stars to her latest book.  I admit that I like traditional poetry better than freeform poetry. That makes it difficult for me to get into contemporary poems. I used to write poems (in Japanese) and loved reading poems both in English and Japanese. What I learned these years was that you describe \"beauty\" without using a word \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\". You have to carefully chose every word. Get rid of every unnecessary word, etc. Every time I read \"One Art\" by Elizabeth Bishop I become tearful even though I have read it more than 100 times. To me, poems are like that. It just grabs my heart.  Amanda 's poems in this book are none of above. She wrote so many words such as \"death\" \"love\" \"pain\" but I did not feel them. They failed to move me. Careless phrases like \"The pain pulls us apart, Like lips about to speak\" failed to give me a clear picture of what kind of image Amanda wanted to give us. She often states something like \"That 's what only words can do-- /Prod us toward something new / & in doing so, move us closer   together.\", \"Lost as we feel, there is no better/ Compass than compassion.\", and these made me feel this book quite didactic. I would not mind them if this book was collection of essays rather than poems.  There are also so many Covid pandemic poems. We are still in the midst of it, but these poems feel outdated.  I regard this book as an experiment of a young talented poet. She will one day look back and tell herself, \"Oh I was so young...\".  My Japanese review:  25 book reviews: Amanda Gorman is a genius. I have said and written here many times that I am really not particularly fond of poetry. Maybe that was always because I had not seen recently poetry of the type that Ms Gorman creates. It looks at us as we are and as we might be. It is full of life and full of hope. It is beautiful. 26 book reviews: Once more, poetry serves as a manifest of the power of words. Special mention to the pandemic poems, which I think are brilliantly written (actually, they all are, Gorman is amazing!) 27 book reviews: Dec 9, 4am ~~ Wow. Review asap.  Dec 11, 5pm ~~ Okay, I give up. I am nearly speechless with admiration for this young poet. I cannot get my tongue untied to contribute anything worthwhile in the form of a proper review, so I will leave it at WOW. Someday I will reread and we will see if any words come to me then. 28 book reviews: \"Whoever said we never die in our dreams Obviously has never been Black.\"  Amanda Gorman has captivated me yet again with poems about surviving the pandemic and being Black in America.

The book weaves together poems that reflect on our collective, and yet also unique, experiences as we navigate the year(s) of COVID - from March 2020 and forward - and also revisits history. Through her poetry, Gorman illustrates that we are not in truly  unprecedented times  as she ties the current state of (American) society to historical events such as the Essex disaster at sea in 1820, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the \"Spanish\" influenza in 1918, ongoing community issues such as AIDS, immigration, grief, and natural events like the behavior of animals in captivity and post memory.  I was not expecting to LEARN and FEEL so much through Gorman 's poems. This book is recommended for adult and teen readers even if poetry is not your usual genre. -Diana F.  ",
    " Crystals for Beginners: The Guide to Get Started with the Healing Power of Crystals": "book reviews: I was  matrix-curious  enough to pay less than a dollar for this book. I subsequently looked it up on GR and saw it had an impressively high 4+ rating. Then, GR also stated that if you are interested in this book how about something on Chakra Healing or The Spell Book for New Witches? I was a bit apprehensive as I opened the book, but that action did not release a djinn or smack me with any evident curse. So I proceeded with my investigation. Here is how Frazier describes learning about the healing powers of crystals: \"Societies throughout history, including ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Greece, used crystals for their healing properties. This practice continued through the ages, although it lessened during the Renaissance, when people believed the healing properties of crystals came from either good angels or bad angels.\"  Let s just continue .. \"There are six lattice patterns that appear within healing crystals. There is also a category of stones known as  amorphous  crystals, even though they are not truly crystals, since they do not have an interior crystalline structure. Some of these include amber, obsidian, opal, and tektites. They each have their own unique properties.\" \"Everything has energy. In fact, quantum physics shows that at its most basic, all matter is made up of vibrating strings of electricity. So is your body, and so are crystals. Humans are far better gauges of energy than you might imagine. Even people with little understanding of energy or energy healing might notice they don t  vibe  with another person. When you experience this, you are sensing energy and recognizing that someone else s energetic vibration isn t compatible with your own energy.\" \"Because crystals generally have higher vibrations than the human body, they tend to raise your vibration. Vibrating at a higher rate is helpful for humans because it allows us to advance spiritually and move in more positive directions mentally, physically, and emotionally.\"  I believe quoting Frazier may be the best way to give you a sense of how this book is supposed to work. \"BE OPEN TO THE EXPERIENCE. I understand having a skeptical mind. When I first experienced noticing change as a direct result of using a crystal, you could have knocked me over with a feather. Not only did I not really believe in any of that stuff, but also, if anyone had told me when I headed out the door that day to go see a medical doctor/energy healer that she d use a crystal to help me get rid of a persistent sore throat, I might not have gone at all. And that would have been very sad indeed. SET ASIDE ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS. Instead, enter the experience with an attitude of curiosity and without telling yourself any stories about how this may or may not work. SET ASIDE EXPECTATIONS OF OUTCOME. I find that having expectations limits what I experience. Therefore, I try not to have expectations as I move into an experience, because the universe may have far grander plans for me than I could ever imagine for myself. Instead of setting an expectation for any specific outcome, allow yourself to be in the moment as you work with a crystal, and observe where it takes you. START WITH A CRYSTAL THAT ATTRACTS YOU STRONGLY. For the first crystal you work with, find one that excites you. If it s one of the crystals I recommend later, great. If it s not, that s okay, too. If you find a crystal that really calls to you, use that one for your healing work. Chances are, it is calling to you for a reason.\"  \"Not everybody reacts to the same crystal the same way. For example, my husband and I went to one of my favorite rock shops in Portland. As we talked with the store s manager, he pulled out a tray of phenacite, which is a very high-vibration crystal. I hadn t encountered phenacite before, and as he set the tray before me (I didn t even touch it), I felt all of my energy lift up and into my head. For lack of a better explanation, I felt high. My husband, on the other hand, felt nothing. So whose experience was more valid? Neither, really. They were just different.\" \"By all means, educate yourself as curiosity arises, but don t do this at the expense of experiencing. Pick up any crystal. Find one that attracts you. Put it in your pocket. Wear it. Hold it. And then continue reading.   And for those who want the quick answer to their wants and needs: \"ROSE QUARTZ supports all types of love, including unconditional and romantic love. AMETHYST helps you tune into intuition and guidance from higher realms, as well as the power of your dreams. BLACK TOURMALINE is a protective and grounding stone that keeps negativity at bay. RAINBOW FLUORITE deepens intuition, promotes love, and facilitates clear communication. CARNELIAN helps you set appropriate boundaries, have integrity, and be creative. HEMATITE is protective, grounding, and centering and can also attract energies you d like in your life. TURQUOISE promotes luck, prosperity, and personal power.\"  Then we can get into the power of various crystal formations: \"DODECAHEDRON The dodecahedron is associated with the element of the Ethers and connects you to intuition and higher realms. HEXAHEDRON The hexahedron, or cube, represents the element of Earth. It is grounding and stable. ICOSAHEDRON The icosahedron is linked to the element of Water. It connects you to change and flow. MERKABA The merkaba is a 3-D star. It contains all five of the above polyhedrons within it and therefore combines all the effects of each. It is also associated with the energy of sacred truth and eternal wisdom. OCTAHEDRON The octahedron represents the element of Air and promotes compassion, kindness, forgiveness, and love.\"  There is a whole discussion of what power lies in  raw  versus  cut  crystals and why you should not always choose the most powerful. \"I choose crystals by intuition. Whenever possible, I hold them in my hand and notice how they make me feel. I note whether they make me feel comfortable or uncomfortable, if they feel heavy or light in my hand, and any other sensations that arise. If I find it a pleasing sensation, I buy the crystal. If I don t, I leave it. That s not to say that once a crystal has given you an unpleasant sensation, you should never revisit that type of crystal. As your needs change, so will the crystals that resonate with you. Pay attention to any attraction you feel toward crystals apart from how they look, and if one calls to you, trust it is a crystal that is choosing you.\" \"Seven Tips for Crystal Shopping For me, crystal shopping is a destination activity. I make a day of it, and I love poking through shops and finding crystals that appeal to me. Here are my top tips for buying crystals in person: 1Ground yourself before you go. Many people find that the energy in crystal shops can feel disorienting. Before you enter the crystal shop, close your eyes and visualize roots growing from your feet into the Earth. If you feel lightheaded while in the shop, pick up a black stone and hold it until the feeling ceases.\" Frazier gives a shout out to the following combination. \"CITRINE + BLACK TOURMALINE can help ground you in prosperity. Citrine is a stone of prosperity, while black tourmaline is grounding and also blocks negative energy, which can help remove thoughts that prevent prosperity.\"  There is much, much more for those willing to mix their hopes and dreams with a full measure of pop science. Your results may vary. 2* Post hoc ergo propter hoc  1 book reviews: To be clear I do not think crystals really do anything vibrationally /energetically to our bodies directly (probably). But it 's clear that we are super drawn to pretty rocks, and love collecting them, and things that make us happy, are actually good for us, plus I am all for anything that prompts mindfulness, healing mindsets, optimism, and even placebo effect. And also maybe crystals do more that this sceptic thinks they do (probably not).  this book is written for someone far more woo woo than me, but at the same time Frazier stays in her lane, she does not make wild science based claims about crystals healing your cancer, but she does suggest tons of what I consider really helpful, mindful, therapeutic ways to use crystals to enhance your spiritual practice (and maybe your health) in ways that I found woo woo in a way that is not off putting or too \"out there\" or just plain crazy or wrong. So basically, I really actually enjoyed this book very much, consider it helpful and not harmful and kinda fun.  2 book reviews: I enjoyed reading this! It has a lot of information about crystals for beginners like me, not too much info where you feel overwhelmed... but at the same time I was actually kind of hoping for A BIT MORE information on the crystals themselves. It touches all the basics though, which is why it s a book for BEGINNERS.  This book has really nice pictures of 50 different crystals, and lots of  prescriptions  for different things like anxiety, inner peace, stress, etc. these  prescriptions  share 2-3 crystals that you could use to help you out and a mantra that you can say while meditating.  I love the texture of the cover, it felt really soft which I know it something super random to say. I enjoyed it, it was my first book on crystals and I can t wait to dive in deeper now.  3 book reviews: This book has everything you need to know about crystals! Karen 's book delves into the all the various crystals and how to use them. You learn how to start your own crystal collection, how to get the most power out of your crystals, and more. If you want to learn about the magic art of crystal healing I cannot recommend this book enough! I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased, honest review. That being said, these opinions are my own! This is truly a fantastic read!  4 book reviews: Crystals for Beginners is a fantastic book. I knew nothing about crystals and this book explained it so plainly. I am very excited to start experimenting with crystals. I received a review copy from the publisher. 5 book reviews: This was interesting. Loved all the suggestions for certain goals/ailments. 6 book reviews: Not knowing anything about crystals and wanting to understand, this book was a perfect starting point. 7 book reviews: The book for review is  Crystals For Beginners  by Karen Frazier. It falls in the genre of health and wellness according to the publishers.  Crystal healing seems to be something that people are taken notice off. According to this book crystals can help fight stress, cope with anxiety, stress, grief and so much more. Inside these pages you will get an understanding about crystals, what each is used for and how it can help you in your daily life.  The first part of the book gives one an understanding of crystals and crystal healing. It is a nice overview.  The next section goes into depth about individual crystals. For example Amazonite. It will give you the origin, the shape, energy, colors, chakra and placement of where on one s body. It will tell you how it helps you and usage tips. This section gives you a number of crystals to dive into.  The last section gets into how certain crystals can help you with things that effect one s life. This can include addiction, anger, anxiety, compassion, courage and a bit more.  If you are interested in crystals and healing and are starting from scratch this is a nice book to start off with considering the information inside.  I do have a few crystals but I have them just due to the fact they were pretty and enjoy looking at them. This book did give me food for thought.  I received this book for free from Callisto Publishing for an honest review.  8 book reviews: I picked this book up because my husband 's cousin is really into the healing power of crystals. I have always found them really pretty but nothing more. I got really curious about them because she raved about how much they help her.  I found this book fascinating. I am still not one to believe in the magical powers of crystals but it was interesting to learn about.  Maybe they are healing and helpful. I do not own any but I want some just because I find them really pretty. Maybe my mind will change when I actually get some. Who knows.  Regardless it was an interesting read!  9 book reviews: This book is beautiful, information-packed, and easy to follow. There were moments when I chuckled and felt I needed to take the writer s absolute statements with a grain of salt, but that didn t bother me. The book was fun to read and gave me enough info to explore crystals in a light  it can t hurt and it might help  kind of way. 10 book reviews: RTC. 11 book reviews: Super quick read. Good resource. 12 book reviews: Ca not complain, I knew what I was getting into. 13 book reviews: Listened to on audiobook but would be better to have the actual book. 14 book reviews: I thought it was a wonderful book to read, especially if you re at your starting point of wanting to use crystals. Hence why the title is  Crystals for Beginners .    It s very informative, but not too overwhelming, so it s a great book to get you started. I feel that there is a fairly good amount of crystals that is spoken about for someone who is a beginner, as well as telling you how you can use them for certain parts of your physical, emotional and spiritual well-being, and getting a better understanding on the purposes of crystal healing.  I most definitely will be getting the crystals listed to start using.   The beauty of this book is that it has made me want to find more and more books about crystals, so I can learn even more than I already do now, thanks to this book    15 book reviews: So much packed in this book   everything from what a crystal is, to exactly how to use it. Beautiful pics of each crystal is also included in both its raw and tumbled form to help with identification. My favorite section is the  Crystal Prescription  guide at the end, with mantras included for each.  I liked this book so much that I finished it wanting more   so I just ordered her  Crystals for Healing - The Complete Reference Guide  to dive into next.  16 book reviews: Great start for beginners  I like how easy it is to find the crystal you re looking for. It has pictures and comes with the healings descriptions and what it s great for. It s almost like a dictionary which was great for learning about crystals for the first time. 17 book reviews: So Informational!  This book is exactly what I was looking for to get a clear introduction to crystals. It is easy to follow and well-organized. It even had more information than expected. I will definitely be keeping this is a reference guide. 18 book reviews: I ve always been attracted to the beauty of crystals and their connection to nature, but I didn t know anything about their energies until I read this book.  I like how the book is optimistic and open-ended as you read through lots of crystal examples. I m not sure how much I ll practice with them, but it was fun and interesting to learn the basics. The mantras and meditative practices mentioned with crystals can t hurt!  I do wish we learned a little more about the history and backstory of crystals. Why do certain crystals hold specific energies? Says who? Some of the information seems random. But overall, a fun and quick read.  19 book reviews: I liked this book a lot because it gave some insight into the various things that crystals can help with. It came complete with detailed explanations and pictures. Crystals make me feel a calm energy. I have a crystal in my work office, one in my home office and one in my car. 20 book reviews: I have become curious about crystal use and this book gave me confidence to begin on my journey. It is quite basic but that s exactly what I needed. The second half of the book is descriptions of different crystals and their uses. 21 book reviews: It is an amazing book with great advice and information. A great beginner s guide to crystals. 22 book reviews: Great beginners guide  23 book reviews: 3.5 24 book reviews: Great book for getting started! I have just started my Crystal collection! This book is easy to follow! 25 book reviews:   um  timo livro pra quem quer conhecer mais sobre as propriedades de cura dos cristais. Pode ser um livro introdut rio pra quem n o conhece nada sobre o assunto. O conte do   bem pr tico, foi bem  til pra mim. 26 book reviews: Very informative, illustrative and helpful 27 book reviews: Most recently I really developed an interest in crystals/healing stones. I have a few crystals (smoky quartz and amethyst) at home, and some mineral rocks that have garnet and more in them; however, I never truly used them much. Until now!  I think that this is a great book for beginners as well as those that may know a little about crystals. It is a great reference guide on what crystal to use, how to use/pair it, and how it looks in the raw as well as polished state. It is well written and the images of the crystals are beautiful. I love the prescription part of the book.  I have read this book twice in the past two weeks, just because it is that worthwhile and informative. I now feel as though I am a bit more prepared to start crystal healing and Feng Shui my home. I am thankful that my soul has called me to familiarize myself with Feng Shui, crystals, and overall a Zen mindset. I am very thankful for the opportunity to have read this book. I definitely recommend it!  28 book reviews: The book starts with an uncontroversial fact that crystals can have a beneficial impact on people. And then it proceeds to outline a highly controversial theory of how and why that beneficial impact arises.  People have found coloured crystals to be beautiful and spirit-raising for millennia. Few would doubt that a heap of diamonds, rubies (etc) can raise spirits. And a necklace or ring with well-crafted stones can be a beautiful thing that generates positive thoughts and feelings. These are uncontroversial facts.  But why and how do crystals affect people? This is where the book becomes far more controversial, outlining a popularist theory of what we might think of as crystalology.  The book says that crystals (like everything else) emit vibrational energies, and those energies interact with people to cause positive outcomes. However, lab created crystals, even if they have the same crystalline structures are less effective than natural ones which have an  unaltered natural energetic power  (6%). If the helpful energies are really a result of the crystalline structure, then it is hard to make sense of that distinction.  More perplexingly we hear that crystals can be made more effective by programming them, by imbuing them with intent (25%). And  crystals choose us, as much as we choose them  (14%). What does that mean?  Some of the recommendations seemed to be based on discredited medieval science. If you are going on a date the book recommends that you should wear a rose quartz over your heart (26%). From an anatomical point of view, what has a heart got to do with love? In the middle ages, people thought that the heart did a person s thinking and feeling, so they associated it with love. Now science tends to locate thinking and feeling more in the head (brain/mind), so surely those seeking love should wear their crystals on their head?  Is this just pseudo-science with a possible placebo effect?  The author does consider whether psychology could be relevant. She accepts that there can be a nocebo effect. If people think that crystals will harm them, then then can indeed do so (12%). However, she does not think that the positive impact of crystals is due to an opposite  placebo  effect, but the book gives no reason for thinking that.  The author does well to advise readers to wash their hands when handling crystals which can have adverse health impacts. And the pictures to identify different crystals are helpful.  But I was concerned when the book looked like it could be suggesting crystals as an alternative to medical treatment. It states that sexual abuse can be dealt with  effectively  by wearing an (orange) Carnelian (68%). Those kinds of comments are irresponsible, as a troubled or vulnerable reader might fail to seek medical help, trusting instead to crystals. The book should unambiguously refer people to medical doctors and make it clear that any benefits of crystals can only be additional to (not alternative to) a proper medical diagnosis and professional treatment of health conditions.    29 book reviews: My first completed read of self-isolation. I am now sleeping with an amethyst by my bedside. It has yet to actually make it easier for me to fall asleep, but I think it is safe to say there are extenuating circumstances. ",
    " Dog Man: Mothering Heights: A Graphic Novel (Dog Man #10): From the Creator of Captain Underpants (10)": "",
    " Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)": "book reviews: In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.  Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked!    The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert 's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief.    \"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of  areal materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"  The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert is not kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it 's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.    The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert 's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.    Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still and with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the , a superman who ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.  The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy s interest in the planet is , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. . There s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.  Our protagonists are the family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. , however is no ordinary prince. There s a teeny weeny chance he might be the , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.  My favourite character, however has to be the , the most evil character I ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three?    In this setting, Herbert does so much, it s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time.    Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-    It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad Dib from Islam. He says  When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.  which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell.  The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.    I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.  1 book reviews: Omg! I found a Folio Society Edition a bit cheaper and brand new! You can see all of the art online but look at this cover! Now I have this and Little Women I actually got from their site. I need to get more as I can       Reread 2022 to try to complete series! (I need to get the awesome audio too) 4.5 Stars                Mel        I was so worried that I would not understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out.  I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book.  I am still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it 's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I did not get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice.  I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble.  I really enjoyed Paul 's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I did not really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I did not have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them.  I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I do not know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I am getting this all wrong but I am trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind.  I do not understand how Paul 's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I am not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)  Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I ca not even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat!  Anyhoo, I really loved the book!  Mel     Thank you for the answers in my comments!    MY BLOG:  2 book reviews: Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I do not doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.  I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.  But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.  The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you would be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I could not figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.  As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It 's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also could not care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.  This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could have been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it did not other than a bit of lip service.  But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could have saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~        3 book reviews: Dune.  No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.  Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.  This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.  Brilliant.  ***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.  This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert 's additions to his fathers great work.  ***2019 reread - I am even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert 's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.  I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert 's great narrative skill.  Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert 's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece.   4 book reviews: There 's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it 's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes 's masterpiece.  Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - do not you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you are cheering for him. Who the hell would not be?  So that was the we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They are led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I am racking my brains... Dubya does not quite seem to fit, but surely he means ? Unless, of course, he 's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You would have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.  I honestly do not think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it 's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite , you would better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?   5 book reviews: No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he 's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I have known many scientists, and they do not talk like this. You are not going to convince me a child does.  The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert 's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you have got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert did not make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it 's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they are more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of  's cast.  Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert 's massive contributions, but they should not pretend to enjoy the books if they do not, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work.  6 book reviews: If you are having a hard time reading Dune: https://youtu.be/UMTRoZNN4E0  My YouTube Review (admittedly totally Fangirling): https://youtu.be/JilubCWr9Kk  This was one of the best books that I have ever read which I was not expecting at all. First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character 's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience.  The book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving. The book was also so unpredictable and unique. Highly recommend.  2023 Reading Schedule Jan Alice in Wonderland Feb Notes from a Small Island Mar Cloud Atlas Apr On the Road May The Color Purple Jun Bleak House Jul Bridget Jones s Diary Aug Anna Karenina Sep The Secret History Oct Brave New World Nov A Confederacy of Dunces Dec The Count of Monte Cristo    7 book reviews: Nope. Sorry I do not get it.  I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.  So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul 's mom describing him kinda weird?  And let 's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.  I am sure I will get plenty of comments telling me ... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment.  8 book reviews: While the cultural impact of this book is indisputable, I could not help feeling incredibly underwhelmed when reading it. Even the plot could not save Dune, since it 's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts?  From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through. It was not for me, and the post-Dune reading slump is real.  9 book reviews: 60 pages in and then i DNFed. world building is literally shit in this book. i wanted to read this book just in case i accidentally bumped into Timoth e or Zendaya but i really tried being  that bitch  but  that bitch  was not trying to be me. horrible, unreadable, and should be illegal but think about it, if this book was written by a woman i just know i d be able to actually read it cover to cover. never again 10 book reviews: just when you thought 2021 could not get any weirder. 11 book reviews: Update 6/27/23  Re-read, number 15.  This time, I read it with my daughter. Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we will be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I am a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse.  PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no?   Update 9/15/21  Re-read. Number 14.  I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read.   Update 8/28/17  Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I am awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe.  *sigh*  Perfection. Easily the number one book I have ever read. :)  I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)    Original Review:  This is a phenomenal classic of literature.  It 's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?  Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.  Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction?  Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.  Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training was not enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.  What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here 's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.  And do not believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We have got PLOT that 's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics.  To quote the text, we have got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.  Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader. Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero. Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour. Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)  And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad wouldib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)  So damn brilliant.  Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there 's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus 's head, with enormous forethought and care.  The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)  The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife 's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.)  And of course, we have our Villains.  The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.  \"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You ca not handle the Tooth!  Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.  The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica 's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.  He was practically Paul 's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.  I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he would not have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.  And then there 's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor 's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul 's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild 's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul 's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.  The setup was gorgeous. Paul 's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul 's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert 's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul 's frantic plans and desires. Paul 's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert 's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul 's death.  Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?  If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.  And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed.  12 book reviews: Update 2 March 2024 I saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2. Maybe Villeneuve is the real Kwisatz Haderach.  Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie.  Read 2015 Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf.  This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership.  The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as  oil  and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well.  13 book reviews:  Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.   The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as  plans within plans within plans,  and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a  Classic  work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn t much to say that likely hasn t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can t go wrong with .  The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.     For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called  spice . You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying   might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions.     Another aspect I find fascinating in is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the  chosen one  trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:  The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.  History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events.   Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I ll discuss soon, can be a form of control.  Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme.   House Atreides Duke Leto says,   a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.  Having recently finished , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don t involve exploitation, but that s not what this book is about so I ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion.   we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises.   Jessica instructs Paul,   The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time.   Kynes 's father says:  Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).     This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice.  There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability or the threat of it and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one.  There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine read this and said  wait, you can just beloved characters that easily!?  before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun.   14 book reviews: Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan. And, honestly, it was the main reason I have always wanted to read this book.   Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan 's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I ca not stop looking at it!  Anyway. I remember that movie when I was young. I honestly did not remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it.    After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times.    Wow. Just . What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly did not have much to do with the actual book. There were some changes that they made to the movie that really did not do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit?    In the book, he 's just a fat dude! And that thing they do where they all have attached to their hearts? Not in the book, either! In fact, none of that fucknut crazy/gross sci-fi shit is in the book.    Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope.    Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope.    Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope.    Mentat 's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope.    Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no!      Not that it should matter. Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It 's a tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It 's honestly an incredibly insightful novel.     A little , but worth it. That 's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters are not your jam when it comes to reading.    I listened to the Audible version which is long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out.  15 book reviews: People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another 's throats over land, money, and drugs.  Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I would say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.  Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.  Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you will know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more.  16 book reviews: 2021 Reread - 5*  I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book.  So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it s worth it.  This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There s just so much brilliance here. And it s entertaining. It s interesting. The balance is perfect.  The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert s crown.  I want to see more of this world.    I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.      is to science fiction what is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen.  The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer.      This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people.    Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him.      The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book.    Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.    Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.  __________________________________  You can connect with me on social media via . __________________________________  17 book reviews: Why You Should Read Dune (video): https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM  Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably is not for the reasons you think.  My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990 's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just was not for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?  I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.  Dune is social science-fiction in that it 's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert does not bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.  If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you are going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders.  I will also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book wo not be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this is not a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.  Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.  18 book reviews:  I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.  I don t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn t think it d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome.  . We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.  Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell.    This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One   but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring  righteous  battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don t they? .      Yes, in Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it s not the rise of an antihero either. It s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle.  A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke , Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as .  But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop.    All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero s/antihero s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not .    And you also can t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can,  The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul s father values lives over property. Paul s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:   It s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature   and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand.    Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too.    out of respect for Herbert s subversive story that made me think. I m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what s to come.  19 book reviews: Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style.  Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I ve read so far and very probably won t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings.  Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real.  Real life implications and innuendos. I don t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination.  Don t take drugs except they make you superhuman As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style.  Bene Gesserit Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the  berPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:  Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements? Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what s really going on. I m really not sure about this whole thing, I ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to  An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly.  Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises? The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched.  Herberts place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame. That s tricky, especially because he just couldn t keep delivering after the third part. I ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.  But that doesn t mean that the first three parts aren t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it s totally worth it once you re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.  Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:  20 book reviews: Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov s (overrated) Foundation stories, it was George Lucas  primary source of inspiration.  One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language   the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad Dib s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles at the start of each chapter.  Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see , , or ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of and , for instance.  : A word about Denis Villeneuve s new film adaptation of Herbert s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn t be to David Lynch s advantage. This is a version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson s trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension.  21 book reviews: I blame the movie.  I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it  a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.  Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).  Besides,    Dune has a lot of ingredients that don t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing.  It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert.    Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied.    Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father s advisors.    But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people.    Seriously, now.  Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar.  On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn t thinking outside the trope character box much (it s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.  Overall, I m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero.   22 book reviews: [UPDATED] I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat).  For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called m lange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud wouldib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons.  There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes.  In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud wouldib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.  The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen.  Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.  [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve 's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch 's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below. [UPDATE] Villeneuve s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert s book and Lynch s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!  Fino 's Dune Reviews       23 book reviews: 3.5/5 Stars  Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.  Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you will find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they ll do a much better job than me. I won t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.  Theoretically, if I m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960 s or 1970 s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy.      Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.    Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert s prose. I haven t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:    And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I ve ever read out of any book    I can t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read:  The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert s prose in describing settings and actions didn t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.  Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you ve read or you re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I ll stop with the series.   24 book reviews: 3.5/5  Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I will start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they have read it say \"Yeah, I love Dune, it 's my favorite book.\" but as it turns out, I am not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes.   Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I had not watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it did not change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book was not the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank 's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the \"wow, what 's happening\" moments did not shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I have read a lot of stories in my life.       Finally ending my rant, because I did not plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I will even manage to finish all six books this year, we will see. I hope at least.      maybe I will be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we will see (I am already having trouble with all the names)  25 book reviews: I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won t attract a worm.  In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen.  The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they ve been waiting for.  This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate.  I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields.  So even though we still got a good sci-fi s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.  There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.  While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that s not Herbert s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story.  26 book reviews: 5   2024 Re-read  I have consumed the Water of Life and felt the spice agony. It has revealed to me the error of my past ways. But as the Lisan al Gaib teaches us, ways can change.       A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Classic! Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as  I don t usually read Fantasy/Sci-Fi ,  Too many made-up words  or  I m just reading before the movie comes out . These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial! As I m firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I d advise you to immediately move on to another review, there s nothing of value here. In fact, I won t actually be writing a review, I ll simply address one simple question:     Dune is sand as far as the eye can see. Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent. Dune is thirst. The distillate esthers of reclaimed waste; the sour effluvia of humanity. It is greedily, no  joyously sipping your overweight Uncle s recycled knacker sweat in a desperate effort to quell the rapid loss of your own bodily fluid. Dune is the Water of Life; Molecular Modification; a Transcendental Trinocular Acid Trip. The [Boy] with Kaleidoscope Eyes experiencing a Psychokinesthetic extension of self. Dune is the middle-aged man who, on hearing praise for his young sons, must always exclaim \"I taught them everything they know!\" Dune is defiance of fear. Dune is an unsettling change in POV turned familiar, insightful friend. Dune is saying very little with a great many words. Dune is Pardot Kynes, micro-ecology, patience and long-term goals. Dune is the Shai-Hulud; the scandalous straddling of a worm. Dune is religion, planted and shaped to the needs of the latest conquests and heraldic symbols. Dune is the Ghost Wind of the Jihad Dune is Alia, is Stewie Griffin. Dune is Feyd-Rautha, is Commodus playing Gladiator. Dune is a feint, within a feint, within a feint. Dune is the house Atreides, is the Greek house Atreus. Dune is the Kwisatz Haderach; the Messiah; a planet afflicted by a Hero. Dune is power and wisdom at the cost of humanity; Friendship lost to worship.   27 book reviews: When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces)  After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! )  When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I m talking about entire books)  Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave.  The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core!  Here are my favorite quotes of the book:   I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.    Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.    The mystery of life is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.    When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it 's too late.    Hope clouds observation.    It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.    Fear is the mind killer.    Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.   28 book reviews: Dune (Dune Chronicles #1), Frank Herbert  Dune is a 1965 science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert.  In the far future, humanity has eschewed advanced computers due to a religious prohibition, in favor of adapting their minds to be capable of extremely complex tasks.  Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is found only on Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sand-worms as its most notable native life-form.  Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire.  Melange allows the Spacing Guild 's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.       :               2018    :    :      :             1397    847            9786001822834              -   20                                                                :                 (           )                           :                                                                                                      :                           (   )             (   :  :                                                                                                                                                                                                                              )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               :                                                   :                                                            :                  .        :          .      ...               .      :                        :    !      ...                 ...               ...   ...                                                                          )             23/09/1399    11/06/1400     .    29 book reviews: TW: pedophilia and rape off page  Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up.  ",
    " Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone: A Novel (Outlander)": "book reviews: 3.5 stars?  I think seven years of waiting means this definitely qualifies as my most anticipated book of the year if not the decade. Was this book worth that long wait? Well.....yes and no.  I honestly think Gabaldon forgot how to make a book have a plot. Clocking in at 902 pages long, you would be inclined to think there will be some epic storytelling going on in this bad boy, and you would be wrong. But I say that with love, because Gabaldon does not need a plot. She has made these characters come to life in a way that few present-day authors can. Does she want to tell me about some bees? How about building yet another house? Travelling somewhere to buy some things? Tell me more! I love these characters and I am obviously biased and will happily read their grocery list. And that 's a good thing, because at one point Claire does indeed give Jamie a shopping list. This is definitely a character study novel with a large cast of characters. So if you are already an Outlander series fan, then this book will hopefully satisfy your seven year itch. However, if you are already kind of on the fence or you have been missing the excitement of the earlier novels featuring just Jamie and Claire and the impending doom of Culloden, well, this book is not likely to improve your opinion of the series. This book is very much giving  'second book in a trilogy' vibes - there is a lot of setup going on for some big events coming soon. It just might take another 7 (or 14?) years until we get to see that pay off. I will be waiting.  1 book reviews: To all the people reviewing this without reading it. STOP! Good, bad, or indifferent. If you have not read a book, you should not be reviewing it. A review requires you to have knowledge of the contents. Also, this is not the place to complain about the price of the book, orders being canceled, or for calling people Karens because they tell you it 's wrong to \"review\" a book you have not read. Also, what is wrong with all of you 1-Star raters? You have not read it. What is your issue? What is wrong with you? Wait for the book to come out and READ THE DANG BOOK! Only then should you bother reviewing it. So rude.  2 book reviews: Self indulgence. 900 + pages of self-Indulgence.  I picture a conversation:  Publisher: please, Diana. Please will you give us the new book? We ve been waiting 7 years  Diana Gabaldon: it s not finished yet. I keep thinking of new chapters I want to add, so that people can know about the smells and sounds that a cadaver makes.  Publisher: for the love of God, just give it to us!  DG: for the love of God that reminds me, I need another chapter featuring a long religious service, or maybe two characters can just discuss religion for like 10 pages.  Publisher: please! The holidays are coming and if we publish it today we ll still make the holiday shopping season!  DG: ok, you can have it, but no one has edited it.  Publisher: it doesn t matter! Send it to the printer!!  This is the only explanation I can come up with for why this book is so bad. That people waited so long for such a bad book it s a tragedy. It s like no one will tell her that her writing has gone in the crapper, or maybe she just doesn t care anymore. That s what it feels like.  If the next book does not conclude this series than I think it will never end. Diana Gabaldon doesn t know how to let go.     3 book reviews: I loved it and didn t love it. I slept through through a lot of it so I would really like the reread of the whole series. We shall see        Mel    4 book reviews: \"Disappointing\" (followed by, \"she 's really not much as a writer...\") about says it all. We have waited a long time for this installment, and I had the fantasy that DG had ample time to polish whatever she was brooding on, but...no. Apologies to those who are enraptured by her \"detailed descriptions\": One would think that a writer who had six or seven years in production of a novel would have ironed out the more egregious flaws, as well as twigged to the fact that this particular offering goes nowhere fast. Now that I have pissed off all the loyal DG groupies out there, I will, of course, expand on that assertion.  First, and I have multiple readings of the previous eight in the series to back me up here: DG has certain \"ticks\" as a writer that an editor really worth his salt should have caught and dealt with. I refer to her overuse of certain stock expressions, as well as niggling inconsistencies in the continuity within and between scenes. To wit: Her characters react to everything from mild surprise to being belted in the head with a heavy object by \"shaking [their] head[s]\" - or, worse, \"shaking [the] head to clear it.\" The last shows up six times, word for word (yes, I counted), which might could be excused by the sheer length of the book, EXCEPT for the fact that this is long-standing bad habit (more wide-spread in other volumes; I counted those, too!), and one that is fairly easy to correct, given modern computer-assisted editing. All that head-shaking is mind-boggling in more ways than the obvious, and revealing of shoddy attention to detail that is basic to the writing process. There are other overuses, but I do not wish to belabor the point.  The inconsistencies: Is it too much to ask that, when a character empties a brandy bottle in Scene X, it stays empty, and he does not pick it up for another glug a breath later? Or that a character introduced as \"Corporal So-and-so\" in one line remains in his rank, not becoming \"Sergeant So-and-so\" in the next line? (See Claire 's operation on Corporal/Sergeant Jackson 's compound leg fracture.) That \"Fizzy\" not become \"Lizzy\" then revert, as does Fergus' daughter?  I think it 's telling that these carelessnesses remain in a novel which carries an Afterword that tries very hard to impress us with all the historical research that went into making it a thing of factual accuracy. A little of the effort expended could have gone into a first-rate job of editing. (After all, DG goes to great lengths to get the plants, the foods, the methods of house-building right, why not the presentation?)  That this offering in the series \"goes nowhere\": The first half carries the slow freight of nailing down where all the important characters of the first eight novels have got to since we saw them last. That feels a lot like drudgery. The second half gets the plot, such as it is, moving in some direction like forward, but not by much, and not steadily. The pace is uneven - lots of space given to the trajectory of Revolutionary War in the abstract, yet a whole pregnancy 's-worth of time on Fraser 's Ridge collapsed in the gap between one chapter and the next. The shift between one locale another, one group of characters and another goes by like whiplash. The \"ending\" we rush to for some shred of resolution is merely a pause while we wait expectantly for the 10th book, leaving me feeling a little used and unsatisfied. Number 9 is a bridge between what DG left off saying in Number 8 and what she really wants to say in Number 10. There 's not much more to it than that.  Therein lies my disappointment with \"Bees\" and its misleading title. Nobody is \"gone\" to make the title more than a grab for attention. Nowt happens - though there are intimations of things that might happen, soon, in the next book, maybe... It does not stand on its own, it 's an attempt to keep us reading a series that is winding down, and it 's more of DG 's same old stuff. I, for one, had hoped for more.  5 book reviews: I finished listening through the audiobook a couple of hours ago, and still feel like crying. But this time the tears are not from actually emoting along with any characters, or from frustration from having to leave them and wait for the next book. This time I fell like crying because Diana Gabaldon has somehow managed to kill the series for me.  For so many years, I loved this series. Most of the characters were relatable, even some of the antagonists (but Stephen Bonnet was always a bit of a cartoon, his psychology was never quite credible). Some of the characters were harder to like, but by the end of the last book, I was cheering hard for Brianna and Roger, who had finally become full people, good and bad, with strong drivers.  And then, after an interminable wait, I return to Fraser 's Ridge to find minutiae, biblethumping and nothing really happening at all except people travelling all over the place. It feels a bit like Diana saw most of the family gathered and rebuilding their society after several difficult experiences, and then thought: \"Ca not have that, they might develop as characters through actually interacting, let 's throw these ones over here, those over there, and, hm, add a bunch around here. Oh, was not I supposed to bring some answers? Well, never mind, I will just remove some of the science and replace it with woo-woo, and give religion the main role in this book!\"  I wonder if it is possible to love this book if you are not religious? In my case, it made my tendency towards strongly disliking religiosity much stronger, and I doubt that I will be able to ever re-read this book, the way I have with all the previous 8.  And where did the guts go? Why push so hard for Agnes and Fanny to go down the traditional route after having given much more exciting alternatives in an earlier case? Why put Lord John back into the same old predicament and kill off one of the more interesting characters in that horrible way instead of showing some personal growth and ability to actually share deep emotions despite the society frowning upon it?  Why plopping out babies all over the place, including one to a woman whose heart should have struggled with a pregnancy and birth instead of magically just bearing all of that without any issues, whatsoever? Oh, and if a child does not fit in here, why just drop them in somewhere else and never deal with any of the deep scars such uprooting can lead to?  Everything just seem so superficial, so virtuous and so obvious that it never became possible to believe in any of the threatening events. They all travel through war and weather without negative consequences, including some suspiciously easy smuggling, and equally suspicious intercultural understanding and tolerance all over the place, including sitting through three different religious services back to back (recounted in sooooo much detail!) and no problems whatsoever in marrying people of different faiths.  Even the great event that we FINALLY get to in the end becomes boring, because anyone with a brain could predict exactly what would be the result after all that foreshadowing!  I might read the tenth book, but will definitely not seek it out! After this book, I do not really care what happens to Roger (barf!), Brianna (boooooooring!), Mandy (annoying as hell), Fergus (who no longer has any personality, apparently), Marsali (who is actually reduced to a baby-machine), Ian (who no longer has personality, either, just saintly patience and goodwill to all), Jamie (who has become insufferable in his preaching and \"perfection\"), Claire (who is apparently now almighty, and at the same time flat and completely uninteresting, how the hell did such a snappish woman become tame?) or even William (who is just a still angsty teenager spewing privilege, yet always right about everything now). The only characters I still feel able to read about are Jemmy and Jenny, whose names are so similar, but still have a little bit of spark left. And I am kinda eager to see the end of the slave who acted so honorably through an entire life, yet in this book became a total villain for no reason. Sigh!  6 book reviews: I adored this book.  Here is the thing about Outlander. My mom read the books in the late 1990s, and got my grandpa and me both hooked on them. Which means I have been reading these books for at least 20 years (more than half of my life). I love them. I do not just love them -- they are a living part of my life.  Now there 's the TV show and a lot more people know about them. Which is fantastic! And a lot of people (including the author!) seem to like the show (which is great!) I do not, and here 's why.  My favorite things in Outlander are not the things that happen but the characters and the way Gabaldon writes about them. From the show, and the \"just like Game of Thrones!\" advertising around it, people seem to focus on the sex and the violence. However, those, to me, are the least important parts of the books. I read these books because they are wonderful to live in. Honestly, I occasionally skim the sex and violence. Those are not the heart of the story.  Gabaldon is an ecologist, and she writes like one. Her books are rich with detail, with nature, and with the small and wonderful stories that happen all around us all the time. (What shall we make for dinner? Are there enough clothes clean? Is the horse 's hoof a disaster or just a rock? Why is the floor so dirty? Did someone let the fire go out?) These intimate details, the tiny bits of historical accuracy, the wonderful way she embraces all her characters: That, to me, is what makes the books worth reading.  A lot of people get hung up on reading I think because that 's where the books start to slow down. It 's one of my favorites of the books for that reason. is in that vein. It 's not as breakneck as , and I love it more.  I adore these books. I love Gabaldon 's work. I love Brianna and Roger and John and Fergus and Marsali and Jenny and William and Ian and Rachel and Claire and Jamie and Lord John and Hal and Clarence the mule, and all the dogs and horses and kids. I love the characters, I love the details, I love the life Gabaldon breathes into the stories.  These are some of my favorite books in which to live.  7 book reviews: Did not live up  I was already incredibly disappointed by the 50% mark of this book. The writer just seems content to allow the plot to ramble on , at times in an incredibly confusing fashion. She does not seem sure where the book is meant to go. The main focuses seems to be on constructing prose on the most mundane things imaginable. For a book of over 900 pages, very little happens in this latest installment. By the 80% mark it was disappointingly clear that very little would come of it. For a book years (YEARS!) In the making I truly thought there would have been more storyline to the actual , well story. Rumor has it there will be a tenth book( hopefully while I am still young enough and in control of my mental facilities to read it). Hopefully, the focus can be on wrapping up the various plots to a reasonable satisfaction.  8 book reviews: I have eagerly read all of Diana Gabaldon 's books and watched the series. This book is by far the worst of the lot. It drags on, is repetitive, and just plain dull and boring. It badly needs a good editor and a less self-satisfied author. I feel she is pandering to diehard fans who are in love with the world she has created and are loathe to be critical. These fans do not want the story to end, so she gave them a largely filler book which just prolongs the story without adding anything at all to character development, relationships, story arc, or even pure entertainment. It is sad. I am giving away my copy of this book to the first person I can find who wants it.  9 book reviews: Tell the Bees that Ms. Gabaldon stayed too long at the fair, placing her iconic characters in repetitive situations in overlong tomes stuffed with minutiae either because she ca not bear to say goodbye to Jamie and Claire or the money they bring in or she would not know what to do with herself if she is not writing about them. The readership that keeps begging her for more of the same, patiently waiting years seem equally emotionally hooked but I broke out of the trance into a more critical stance after book 4 or 5 and stopped reading after 6 or 7, just skimming for plot lines. The latter books sit on my shelf, not really beckoning anymore.  I would recommend any lover of romance fiction to read the seminal work Outlander even though the author insists her maiden work along with its sequels is \"not a romance\". However, observation of long comment threads demonstrates conclusively that her readers or watchers of the TV series who are overwhelmingly female are not feverishly loyal for the background history or lessons in botany. Those just get in the way of their obsession with the main pair or probably more accurately, Jamie - \"king of men\". A woman who was in her 30 's when Outlander came out in 1991 is now in her 60s, ironically aging almost in pace with the characters she adores so their greying hair does not bother her but I wonder about an unwary youngster starting at the beginning, how long she will binge read when it becomes about Gramps and Grandma Fraser? Most youngsters cringe at senior sex. Then there 's the problem of the vast bulk of the series taking place in America during a very well known Colonial epoch so boredom sets in.  Rating the series to date, it started out 5 star for me but the author 's inability to resist any stray thought in her head thus diluting the power of the admittedly wonderful characters she created, clouding them behind detail merely because she ca not bear to let them go is steadily decreasing the rating. It remains to be seen if she manages to stick the ending after a stretched out 10-behemoth build-up or stumble into a disappointing anti-climax. (The TV series Lost comes to mind). Maybe she will return to 5 stars, but not with this penultimate volume, dedicated to readers so invested in Jamie and Claire it seems possible they will mourn their eventual loss more than some friends in real life. Well, there 's always re-reading...at least the first trilogy!  10 book reviews: Rated an AMAZING 5    I m late to this  party  of reading GO TELL THE BEES THAT I M GONE, but that s actually by design. The only books that I buy anymore that aren t ebooks are those written in the Outlander series. In order to fully appreciate and immerse oneself in the story, I feel I must breathe in the perfume of its pages and sense the story through my fingertips.  This being the ninth book in the series, the 880 pages didn t dissuade me. I ve read previously that Gabaldon researches the subject matter skillfully for years and when writing the masterpiece at hand it again takes years. I tell you readers that the end result is a work of art.  I knew that when I began this book that it would be a time commitment. So what?! All of that research is used to build the layers of the background, the characters  lives and the adventure! The reader is the benefactor of all the hard work the author has done to present an intelligent, magnificent, remarkable story.  If you don t like history, don t read this book. If you love to learn about the past, if you love to increase your vocabulary, if you love vibrant characters and, if you love realistic or fantastic adventure..read this book!  11 book reviews: I am highly disappointed in this long-awaited book. While I know Gabaldon does not write in a linear fashion, this book seems very disjointed and many scenes were extraneous to any of the story lines. Which is another problem - there are so many insignificant characters from previous books who are reintroduced in this book, but they add nothing to the story (can we please kill off Percy Wainwright yet?).  I hate to say it, but I was bored throughout this whole book. Normally I cannot put down an Outlander book, but this one did not hold my attention at all.  12 book reviews: i m probably going to get hate for this but, to be perfectly frank, all but the last ~15% and the business with amy was boring. all these stars go to john and william s portions. this was a disservice to the previous books and to the characters. 13 book reviews: Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone by Diana Gabaldon is a continuation of Outlander and is the ninth book story about a special bond between James Frazer and Clare that lasts no matter what. In this book, we also learn about Rodger 's and Briana 's time travel on their own. Here we notice that most lives go on Frazer 's Ridge, a new house and tenants. James is aware of the future and makes decisions accordingly. I have listened to this book on Audible with spectacular narration and enjoyed it so much.  14 book reviews: Nothing will ever be as great to me as the early Outlander books, which is partly owed to the fact that they are more romance than family saga   which this series has become by now   and partly because the setting, bonnie Scotland, just held more magic to me. The mixture of domestic scenes, the episodic if not meandering storytelling with a side of drama is far from what I used to love about book 1.  Still, after almost 20 years - and after waiting 8 long years (!) for this book -, I will always return to this series and get my hands on any bit of Jamie and Claire even if it s no longer as addictive as it used to be. And even if by now I m more interested in William, Jamie s  natural son    probably because his character arc is still developing.  (I picture William as Christoper Mason  , not just because he resembles Sam Heughan aka Jamie   )     Speaking of character arcs: the is probably my biggest disappointment. After waiting for so long, I can t say my expectations have been met.  I also felt like the of this historical romance/family saga was (including very vivid olfactory descriptions) and   *********************************************************************************************      0%: I really hope Gabaldon will catch us readers up on the events of the previous books.  7% I need more detailed recaps on book 8.

Smh.  83% I can t help being disappointed that William and Bree did not have more meaningful encounters.

Settling in to wait another 8 (?) years.   15 book reviews: Update as of 25 Dec 2021...  So I have been reading reviews of this book from longtime Outlander fans who were not happy with the quality of the book. I ca not say I am surprised, because I went through the same exact thing with Jean M. Auel and her Clan of the Cave Bear series.  The first books in both series start off very strong. You are sucked into the world these authors create. So when they write more books, you are happy.  I fell in love with Jean M Auel 's series and read the five books that at that time were available. As I read the books, I noticed a decline in quality, and a increase in repetition, something that I hear about the later books in the Outlander series.  The second-to-last book of the Cave Bear really dragged on, with a lot of fixation on the main character (another complaint I see echoed in reviews for Go Tell the Bees I am Gone) but I was glad when book 6 came out because Ms. Auel had announced it was the final book. However, I was let-down by it, as many of my fellow fans were.  So Outlander fans who were disappointed with this book, I feel your pain, because I have been through the same thing with a different author. How much it sucks to invest yourself into a series, only to watch it peter out due to repetition, laziness, the characters becoming Mary Sues, etc... I also experienced much of the same with Anne Rice 's vampire series and how she turned Lestat into a Gary Stu.  I stand by the original review I wrote for this book way before a release date was even announced, because what I was afraid would happen, DID happen. I know the pain of being disappointed in something you love, and from the criticisms I see of this book, it seems like the final Outlander book is going to be even worse unless Gabaldon gets off her high horse and gets her shit together, or given the increased wait between subsequent books of the series, DG might very well die before she finishes it, just as GRRM might die before he finishes the Song of Ice and Fire series (another series I used to love but grew disappointed in)  Books are wonderful, but it 's a shame when authors let this happen to their own series and creations.  -----  Update as of 24 Sept 2021... When I first wrote my review for this book back in January, I was venting a little because at that time, DG had been putting off the release of this book for years now, and the date and cover had not yet been released. As someone who has (or had, since I have given up now) been waiting for the next Game of Thrones book, it looked like DG had been befallen by the dreaded GRRM syndrome. I had been watching the Outlander series on Netflix and read book 4.  So I wrote the following review with that in mind, and did NOT give this book a star rating since I had not read it and did not feel it would be fair, but still had to put in my .02.  However, some whiny-ass Karens decided to give me grief over this review, and after the most recent whiny-ass comment, I decided, fuck it, I will go ahead and give this 1 star. After all, a bunch of people are giving this 5 stars despite not having read it.  So yeah, I am giving this book 1 star. Jamie and Claire need a break already, and I hope they get one in book 9.  -----  Original review as of Jan 2021...  Methinks it 's time to just... wrap things up.  Now, I know a fair amount of this author 's fans will disagree, hate on me, or dismiss me as a troll. but I need to make it clear that I am not trying to attack the author personally, nor am I giving this book any stars as I have not read it.  The one book I did read was Drums of Autumn, which had been given to me as a gift not long after its release by a relative who knew I enjoyed reading and assumed I would enjoy something that was popular. And do not get me wrong, Drums of Autumn was well-researched and written. I DID enjoy it, but did not read any more of the Outlander books because I had plenty of other books in my TBR pile.  However, I recently discovered Outlander on Netflix and watched all 4 seasons of it (as of this date) So many fucking twists and turns, so I decided to spoiler myself on the books via some Wikia reading (yes, I am a spoiler hound) and ca not help but feel overwhelmed and dismayed at how many times Jamie and Claire keep getting torn apart only to find one another, only to get torn apart fucking again.  All of the 8 Outlander books - not including the side-stories - are pretty damn thick novels and I felt exhausted reading about all the twists and turns. It feels too much like the Clan of the Cave Bear series (which I actually read all of them) where the first book was awesome but then the rest of the series went into a decline/drag.  Come on, Ms. Gabaldon. Can you just give Jamie and Claire a fucking break? Reunite them and THIS TIME JUST LET THEM STAY TOGETHER.    EDIT - This review was written BEFORE the cover and publication date were announced - at that time, I had legit reason to believe that the author was suffering from GRRM syndrome (Game of Thrones reference for those who do not know who GRRM is)  I am pretty tempted to give this book 1 star just because of all the bitches whining and complaining about by review.  16 book reviews: Well that was disappointing   17 book reviews: Shock shock shocked by the 11/23/21 release date! Thought for sure it was going to be 2022 after she just finished the final draft a week ago. Let 's go, editors!! Woohoo! *preordered* 18 book reviews: Well... wow. Just wow.  6/5 ... like it could be anything else.. 19 book reviews: I impatiently waited for this to come to print and now we begin the wait again for what I believe will be the final installment. Sigh. The nature of reading for me is to become deeply absorbed into the created world so much so that you laugh with them, cry with them, feel the joy and grief and everything in between. The action shifts up and down the Atlantic seaboard, as characters from past volumes reappear, die, are kidnapped, or are healed by Claire 's medical knowledge, while new family members are born or adopted. Fans of the series should be pleased by new developments, but now must begin the long wait for the conclusion in number 10. Diana Gabaldon is a master at it. I had to take breaks while reads to try to settle from the wealth of emotions this storytelling evoked and yet at the same time needed to know what came next. There are a couple high-tension moments that make me worry for the fate of the Ridge, and a bit more development into speculation as to how the whole time travel thing works. This series started out life I believe as a creating of cross stitch and without doubt all the threads are coming together. A wonderful book I am sorry to have finished.  20 book reviews: The long wait is finally over. I just love this series. It is 1779, Jamie, Claire, Brianna and Roger and their children are finally reunited on Fraser s Ridge. I was so happy to be back on Fraser s Ridge. I was afraid I wouldn t remember what happen after all this time, but I got right into it. We learn of Brianna s and Roger s journey through the stones. Bree brings along a book written by Frank Randall, a history of what is to come. William is still coming to terms with the discovery of his birth father Not a perfect book. The first half is a revisit from some of the events that have previously occurred in other books. The second half was more interesting. Some characters were hardly mentioned at all. I would have liked for William and Jamie to have had more interaction with one another. There was however a heart throbbing life or death situation and a cliff hanging ending. All in all I just love reading about Jamie and Claire. I missed it very much. Hopefully the conclusion is not far away.  21 book reviews: Outstanding!  Spellbinding, as usual. I could not put the book down. I loved the continued character development, the suspense and the historical fiction of the novels. Of course, I continue to love Jamie and Claire! 22 book reviews: 3.5, rounded up because it was hard enough not giving an Outlander book 5 stars.    Kills me to say it, but this installment did not measure up to the rest of the series and it has me anxious as heck for the last book. (Please let it be nothing like this one.) The writing did not feel anything like DG s best, regurgitating/ reminding  us of previous storylines to the point of taking you well out of the moment in this book .. which was easy enough considering the lack of atmosphere (thanks, Rose!) that usually draws you into her stories.  There were a few trademark moments that made my heart happy, but they were few enough; I found myself bored often, waiting to something, anything, really. The length was a crime considering not a whole lot happened + a good 100 or more pages were either devolving into an earlier book s plot summary or needlessly moving people about. I don t know what happened with this book, but the characters deserved much better than this.  - -  .. It s been three weeks and it feels like I really should make this a 3 , but it huuurts.   Maybe when I reread it.    23 book reviews: Did I enjoy visiting with the Frasers and assorted friends, family, and pretty much everyone they have ever met and a bunch of new characters after a 7 year book drought? Yes. I loved the Outlander series long before it was a TV show (the show is fantastic too), and I was excited for this new book installment. My more than 1 star rating reflects this nostalgia.  Am I angry and annoyed that a 902 page book that took 7 years to write and publish had NO PLOT ARCH and NO ENDING? Yes. The book is a collection of literary vignettes about dozens of subplots which reads more like a collection of interwoven short stories (many with unresolved plot threads) than a novel. If you are hoping for a beginning, crescendo, and great ending or some combination of the 3, you wo not find it here. I hate cliffhangers in books in general, but I especially hate them when it will be 5 to 7 years (if the pattern holds) before the next book is written and released. Admittingly, a few of the subplots are interesting, but since so many of those were unresolved as well, it was like being punched in the face with mini cliffhangers before the big knockout punch at the end.  If I knew days ago what I know now, I would not have read this. I would wait until the series is finished (which realistically could be 14 to 21 years if Gabaldon does 2 or 3 more) and read the remaining books at once. This is my stance going forward.  24 book reviews: Lawd fix it! It only took me 6 months of off/on reading to finish this BEAST of a book, but man was it worth it. Davina Porter is a goddess of a narrator and made all the times I got  lost in the woods  worth it. Diana is all about details. Sometimes it a little much, but I m grateful in hindsight for every tender morsel. Even parts about Jamie farting because *ahem* we can t all be Perfect  .  I can t wait to discuss all kinds of theories on my upcoming podcast episode. So many things about Frank. Ifrinn, freakin Frank!! Talk about mind blowing lightbulb parts. And Claire!! The things that woman can do. The things she did. I will never get enough of Jamie & Claire. This is why they are my otp of all time!! Bree, Roger and the kids. Ian, Rachel, Jenny and the rest of the gang have my heart. I wish I could get out all these immense feels, but I ll save it for the podcast!!  Bravo, Diana. Once again you ve left us with full hearts and a bit of a cliffhanger, but not too terrible.  25 book reviews: I started reading Gabaldon in 1994. At least half of you who read this book, and became Gabaldon fans in the first place, did so because of people like me who were in on this from the early days. I remember being in a Compuserve forum with DG. I was one of those that recognized the way Gabaldon blended detail, research, and lyrical prose into a well-paced story and begged for the next volume that would equal the one before. So let 's be clear. I have earned the right to say this. This book should not have been written. This series should have ended 3 books ago. At least 3 of the last 5 books in this series were dragged out disasters where the overblown ego of the author has turned a wonderful story into a cautionary tale of what happens when writers start to believe that people hang on their EVERY word. No one who read this book could possibly come up with a plot summary that justifies 900+ pages. Because in 80% of the book, nothing happens.  26 book reviews: Disappointing  I was greatly anticipating the ninth book in the series yet sadly found myself bored at times with the feeling I had read some of the plotlines in earlier books. The ending came as no surprise - I will not include a spoiler but it was obvious the two characters had to meet again one, predictably, needing the help of the other. Perhaps the final book will tie up all the loose ends and provide a decent resolution for these incredible characters. I just hope the author has enough interest to see the saga finished.  27 book reviews: 7 years?? What??  I usually do not write reviews unless something makes an impression that just is undeniable, and this definitely qualifies. Be aware of spoilers ahead!  After finishing this book this morning all I can say is that I am left with the feeling of being stabbed in the back by my best friend. After a seven year wait between publications, it is safe to say that we were all expecting a lot from Mrs. Gabaldon, and for me it fell woefully short.  I just do not understand. At least 500 pages of this could be eliminated and we would be none the wiser for the amount of useless page filling of domestic life (i.e. butter churning, house and privy building, child rearing), Claire 's curing of ailments of all the tenants that we could not care less about and serve no pivotal meaning to the serious lack of plot, and all the religious blah, blah, blah concerning Roger. Seriously, if I had to read one more house blessing, christening, funeral, or visit concerning Roger 's newfound role as minister to the Ridge I was going to lose my mind! And all the time spent trying to decide on a name for Ian and Rachel 's son! I literally found myself dosing off in every chapter and had to start skimming just to get to the things that were actually worth reading, which was not very much. By the time we got to something happening that mattered I basically just did not care anymore.  I mean how may times is Jamie almost going to die, but then not? Do not get me wrong, I do not want him to, but it 's just a redo of the same old tired story arc. Not to mention, Claire has powers now??? That whole thing just feels very disjointed and like it does not belong. Also, what a huge letdown that in 900 pages we got not a single ounce of interaction between Jamie and William.  And speaking of William, the whole entire part of this book devoted to him was just a bore. Does anybody else just not care about his search for Ben (who is a character who we do not give a hoot about and has never been a part of anything that matters)? And the \"love story\" between William and Amarantha? Blah, Blah, Blah.  Ulysses? I do not think I need to say anything more about that. Just, what the crap?  All in all, this was a huge mess full of tons of side characters and minute details that contributed nothing to what little plot there actually was. These books have steadily declined since Drums of Autumn for me, but at least (with the exception of The Fiery Cross) there was enough there in the previous books to keep me going in order to overlook the details that did not matter, but not this time. And after having invested so much in these books and developing such a love for these characters, it 's so disappointing to feel like you just do not care anymore about the end result. Let 's be honest, we will probably have to wait 10 years just to find out. All I can say is that if number 10 really is the last entry in this series, I sincerely hope that Diana can do better than chapter after chapter of useless page filling. These characters that we love deserve a much better sendoff than trivial musings about domestic life, another woman giving birth, Claire doing another surgery, and another death prediction or presumed death for Jamie.  28 book reviews: I just wanna say one has to admire Diana Gabaldon 's NERVE to write NINE novels about the same pair of characters, who are not getting younger. Or better. Or even changing in any way, to be honest. They reached the absolute perfect relationship in the third book and have just been living Wild Adventures since then, no significant evolution in sight.  This is all so tiring for everyone involved. I am growing tired of reading, people are getting tired of expecting new books, the characters are tired of existing (I swear I can feel Claire 's back aching and Jamie 's knees joints getting weaker since book 4). Do not you feel tired too, dear author?  Do not put these poor souls through a whole bunch of mischief and adventures all over again, I beg you. Let them (and all of us, too) rest and move on, Diana!  ps.: Good lord, Diana! You had nine books to pick a new main character... There were so many good people hanging on from the first 3 books of the series, you know? Why could not you give them a good plot? Why did you had to make their lives so uninteresting? It 's a true shame.  ",
    " Grumpy Monkey": "book reviews: Jim Panzee (best monkey name ever?) wakes up grumpy one day. His friend Norman recognizes this, and with the help of some other animals tries to cheer him up  but some days you are just grumpy and ca not help it.  I actually really enjoyed this one. It 's a book that tries to show children that sometimes they do not always feel cheerful and that 's okay. Those feelings can pass and one does not have to always try to act cheerful. As someone who has fought with depression for most of his life, I also like that it also tries to express that just because someone is sad and grumpy does not mean they do not care for their friends just as much as they care for him. Overall this is a very charming children 's book. Funny and expressing some fairly complicated feelings in an easy to understand way.  The illustrations are also fantastic. My daughter also loves how the different animals are presented (in particularly the snake who suggests a hug). All around a very charming little book. 4/5 stars.  1 book reviews: This book was so adorable! Poor grumpy monkey. I think it 's a great story for kids--and some adults too--to help them understand a negative feeling without making them feel guilty about having said negative feeling. That 's my favorite thing about the book--the lack of negativity. The art was cute and I loved the use of colors, especially red. I highly recommend this wonderful book for all ages. 2 book reviews: My son absolutely loves monkeys. So, I absolutely had to get this book for him even if maybe he is too old for these books. Just look at the wonderful bookcover! This book mainly talks about feelings and about the fact that sometimes it is ok to feel grumpy and sad. It is not a big deal and you can bounce back when you feel ready. In the book Jim Panzee wakes up in a bad mood and his friend Norman tries to cheer him up with the help of almost every animal in the jungle. Jim tries to feel good to make Normal happy. Unfortunately every emotion he shows looks fake. Even the smile on his face. Maybe he just wants to enjoy being grumpy in peace and quiet.  3 book reviews: Monkey lives in the beautiful jungles. One day he wakes up grumpy and he knows somethings off. Everyone is asking him what 's wrong and he 's tired of everyone on him. So he 's grumpy, let it be. He blows up and finally he 's able to realize that it 's a good day to be grumpy.  It 's a great story about sometimes we just have to sit with our feelings. One of my favorite things about Whinnie-the-Pooh is how they include Eeyore. They do not expect him to be happy, he can join the group and still be sad and that 's okay. I just love that. I think this story too, was getting at that. Sometimes it 's simply a grumpy day. We do not always have to be 100% super charged happy.  It has some great artwork and I would be down to read the next book.  4 book reviews: I bought this for my infant son a couple weeks ago but did not read it to him until today.  Basically, a chimp named Jim Panzee (get it?) wakes up in a bad mood and his friend Norman wo not let him enjoy it in peace. Norman drags Jim all over the jungle, trying to cheer him up, until he gets into a fight with a porcupine and winds up in a bad mood himself.  I did not see that twist at the end coming. I like that the book ended with both Jim Panzee and Norman pissed off. Norman trying to cheer Jim up reminded me of how we treat people with depression like they just need to drink more water or go outside or something.  The illustrations were great. I have subjected myself to some shitty children 's books the last three months but this one was pretty cool. Four out of five pissed off chimps.  5 book reviews: My husband is a professional illustrator. Consequently you have to be bloody good at what you do to get me to enjoy your children 's picture book let alone impress me enough to get me to read your book multiple times and point at various pictures and laugh like a hyena and try to pet some of the animals you drew because they are so damn cute and start cooing in an especially idiotic baby voice about how \"frick'n adorable that angry goddamn monkey is!\"  So hats off to you Suzanne and Max Lang!!!  Suzanne Lang has written a very simple story with a very simple message that, in my opinion, very rarely gets center stage in children 's picture books. Sometimes you are grumpy and there 's not a damn thing you can do about it except be grumpy. Way too often I find that children 's books that focus on feelings feel the need to \"fix\" those feelings. The bunny is sad and has to do x, y, and z to get happy again. Its incredibly important for children to learn that feeling grumpy or sad is normal and even healthy. Taking the emphasis off of correcting a perfectly normal way to feel and putting it on accepting and processing it is just so refreshing to see.  Its also handled hilariously. Every attempt that gorilla, monkey 's best bud and neighbor, makes to help his friend cheer up is portrayed with a \"Looney Tunes\" level of madcap lunacy. He 's invited to dance up close and personal with the porcupines, encouraged to \"hug someone\" by a boa constrictor, and my personal favorite urged to \"eat old meat\" by the scavenger Marabou stork just to name a few.  Ultimately he blows up at everyone and huffs off by himself where he finally realizes he just needs to be grumpy right now.  Everything about this book delighted me. Max Lang 's illustrations are just epic. He has to have done Disney animator levels of observation to so perfectly capture the various animals portrayed here. The titular grumpy monkey is so hugely alive on every single page and grumpier and grumpier until his final (hilarious) explosion of epic grumpitude. Lang walks this very fine line between a very innocent cartoony style and super realism with the way his animals move. He gets so much character to come through in each picture. His colors are incredibly bright and everything has a wonderful joy and energy to it.  We have read this multiple times in my house in the last few weeks and the whole idea of letting yourself feel whatever you are feeling rather than trying to fight it has really resonated with my littlest one. Every time we finish it he throws up his arms and says \"sometimes you just need to be grumpy!\"  Now if the Langs would just write a book on the merits of room cleaning or not throwing solid objects directly at your brother 's head...  6 book reviews: Jim Panzee, what a character. He 's grumpy, but he wo not acknowledge it.  Every one of us has been where Jim is. And then we have felt crappy about bringing everyone else down.  The Grumpy Monkey series gives us such a great wake up call to realize how our moods affect others, both good and bad.  7 book reviews: 4.5 Stars  LOOK at that cover!!! :D  Jim Panzee woke up in a grumpy mood. His day felt all wrong even though it looked like such a wonderful day all around. Jim s grumpiness showed itself in his tight stance, bunched eyebrows, and frown. Look at that face!!! Haha I look like that on Monday mornings. As Jim moved through his day though, friend after friend ask about his mood and try to turn his frown upside down. So why is Jim in such a bad mood on such a beautiful day? Is there a reason? Jump in and see.  The illustrations in this book are chock full of fun! Every color, detail, and facial expression brings such life and movement and emotion to the story. Look at the eyes and faces of every animal! Monkeys, peacocks, zebras, lemurs, snakes, and more! They re all in here with Jim. But Jim s face Haha Jim s very expressive face made me smile,  aww  and sympathize with him 100%. We all have cranky days.  And that s it! The message! That s my favorite part of this book! It has such a simple and true message that any and all readers can relate to it. The power of the words really caught me off guard actually.      Brilliant!!! We can t be happy all the time. Grumpy days happen. And Jim s story reminds readers that it s okay to be grumpy. But it s nice to have friends to support you through those down days too.  Highly recommended.  Please check this one out!  8 book reviews: Grumpy Monkey is a great conversation starter about how it is okay to not have a good day, as long as you do not hurt someone s feelings. Author Suzanne Lang tells of how Jim Panzee is having a pretty tough day, but he does not want to admit it when asked by his various animal friends. He decides, instead, to pretend that everything is fine and  smiles  to mask his true feelings. However, he ends up feeling worse because he is not being true to himself. (Even as adults we understand the dangers of hiding our feelings and putting on a front). Only after acknowledging his true feelings, to his friend Norman, does Jim begin to slowly feel better.  We all have rough moments. Occasionally, we have rough days. It is important that we allow ourselves to have these moments and be honest with ourselves about them. However, we must also ensure that we do not use these grumpy feelings to treat others poorly. The story ends by leaving us with another powerful message: it is good to have someone we love and trust to share our feelings with.  **Special shout out to Max Lang, who provides the beautiful illustrations that help drive the narrative.  9 book reviews:                   :                                                           .       10 book reviews: Poppy: Dad! I am mad at you!  Dad: Poppy, are you pretending to be grumpy so that you can pretend to be not grumpy?  Poppy: Yes.  Dad: I thought so. What did you guys think about the book?  Eleanor: Uh, I liked it.  Poppy: I it.  Gwen: It was good.  Dad: Gwen, you know, I thought about you the most while I read this book.  Gwen: Oh. Um. Cool? Poppy, did you know that on Monday you are going to see me in a play?  Dad: Do you know why?  Gwen: Um... because I am sometimes grumpy, I guess?  Dad: Not really.  Gwen: What?  Dad: That 's not really the reason.  Gwen: What is it?  Dad: You often like to hide your feelings. When you grumpy, you do not like to talk about why you are grumpy. You are not grumpy very much, but when you are, you do not like to talk about it. Do you agree?  Gwen: Um, a little bit, I guess. Yeah.  Dad: Poppy, you said loved the book?  Poppy: Yes.  Dad: Why?  Poppy: Because it was the best. Well, not the best, but it was so good. It was funny he said, \"I am GRUMPY!\" And he says it weird.  Dad: El, what about you?  Eleanor: I liked the book - especially when it said, \"Maybe you should dance!\" And dad, you checked last time we read it, and it was the porcupine that said it. And it was Norman who danced with the porcupine, but ended up falling on it.  Dad: Yeah, that was a good catch by you. It 's weird that you are the only one who ca not see the pictures, and yet you are the only one out of all of us who caught that. -That Norman took the porcupine up on his offer.  El: *Laughing* That 's funny.  Dad: Yeah. It was a good \"text to text connection.\" I liked the book, because I sometimes get annoyed too when I am grumpy and everybody is asking me why I am grumpy. ...Ca not I just be grumpy sometimes?  11 book reviews: I want to be Grumpy Monkey 's friend. Heck, I AM Grumpy Monkey 9/10 of the time. Picture books are deceiving. They hide big stories within their little bindings. This is a story we all need to hear: it 's okay to feel your feelings, lean into them as long as you do not hurt others in the process.  Norman the gorilla 's butt bandaged hanging with Jim the (grumpy) monkey at the end is classic. Look closely at the photos for hilarious side stories (the snake hugging his meal on one page, the snake fat, hanging from a branch on the next...)  12 book reviews: When a cute little monkey just needs a damn hug... 13 book reviews: A bit conflicted on the message here, so am going with an  okay  rating. I loved the clever illustrations and the side humor in them. It showed a realistic human trait through the medium of the monkey. I liked the message about being honest and not lying about our feelings. At the same time, though, I was a little concerned about the final message of sitting down and indulging in grumpy, since there s a fine line between being honest and letting oneself be a mean killjoy. Jim Panzee made his friends sad because he was sad, and he snapped at them for things that weren t their fault. So overall the honest message is good, and the story is clever, but it missed a large point about how Jim s selfishness also affected his friends  day.  14 book reviews: Sometimes we are just in a mood, even if nothing 's prompting it. If we do not fret about it too much, it will pass. What really does not help is our friends telling us to just get over it. This book is a fable for all ages, with cute illustrations (and the animals do not wear clothes.. yay!). I am adding the sequels (!) to my lists now. 15 book reviews: -Story: A book about it being ok to sometimes be grumpy. 3 stars. -Illustrations: Adorable. 4.5 stars.  Total: 3.5 stars. 16 book reviews: I am a bit grumpy myself right now, reading (and reviewing) lots of mediocre, overrated picture books, and the words \"NY Times Best Seller,\" struck fear into my heart, because most of what ends up there is sheer sh*t.  But Jim the Grumpy (and he is grumpy)monkey made me smile, and his friend Norman got a giggle out of me with the reason he 's unhappy--a tuchus full of quills because he danced with Porcupine. And though I would probably rate this one at 3.5 -3.5, the conclusion--I will feel better soon, but it 's a good day to be grumpy-- wrangled that fourth star from me for this one.  17 book reviews: The perfect read after a day the made me grumpy! The artwork is both cute and lovely. The verse charms, making you smile and hear children 's giggles in your head. Suddenly grumpy feels pretty darn good. 18 book reviews: Das war so toll  f r meine Kids (5, 3) noch etwas schwierig zu verstehen, aber die Bilder allein haben sie schon so begeistert  19 book reviews:    .              ! 20 book reviews:  For now, I need to be grumpy.   That s real   21 book reviews: Sometimes you just wake up grumpy and no matter what you do or what others around you do or say, you are just grumpy...and that is perfectly fine. Jim Panzee...first, that name makes me happy...is adorable, and the artwork in this book is rich and colorful...and happy! Kids need to know it is okay to be grumpy for no reason...sometimes you just need to be grumpy and let it work itself out. I adore this book. 22 book reviews: A monkey wakes up grumpy and everyone tries to make him feel better. It is only when he meets a grumpy gorilla that he actually starts to do so.  A fun little story of feelings and finding effective ways of dealing with them that is quite kid-friendly. Who has not woken up grumpy sometimes? 23 book reviews: YES! Sometimes we are just grumpy, and this is okay! I will be buying this book in bound form. It 's a winner. 24 book reviews: Puiki knygel ! Linksma,bet kartu labai reikalinga apie emocijas, kurios gali b ti sunkios, nemalonios bet reikalingos ir apie tai kas padeda tai i gyventi! 25 book reviews:   muito fixe   26 book reviews: \"Es un d a perfecto para estar un poco gru n.\" 27 book reviews: The illustrator of this book is named Max, so that 's cool. My dad really liked this book, and that makes me like it too. Dad said he 's been called grumpy before, and he 's pretty hairy like a monkey. We like making monkey sounds together and then giggling. Mum had to explain to dad that the moral of this story is that grumpy monkeys are allowed to be grumpy and that we should just accept that negative emotions are totally okay and not try to force monkeys to be happy. Dad was pretty impressed that mum knew that. I am glad she gets it because I HATE it when adults shove toys in my face when I am super upset and crying hard. Hugs from mum and dad help, and then when I am feeling better it 's fun to make monkey sounds together... oo oo oo ooo ah ah ah ahh!!!  28 book reviews: Sometimes, you are just grumpy. And it 's okay.  Sometimes a monkey is just a monkey, but these days, we need to think about anthropomorphism through more critical lenses.  http://readingwhilewhite.blogspot.com... 29 book reviews: So expressive, with some great messages (sometimes it 's ok to be grumpy for no reason, looking happy on the surface does not mean you are actually happy on the inside, sometimes being grumpy together with friends in an accepting way can make it all just a tiny bit better). I loved it!! ",
    " How to Win Friends & Influence People": "book reviews: This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and \"win friends\" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.  It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It did not matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they were not redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I did not really want and, because I was so preoccupied with \"winning\" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people.  I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that 's really just me trying to find something positive (using the \"principles\") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.  If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you will only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.  Thank you for reading this review.   1 book reviews: Dale, saying people 's names often when you are talking to them, Dale, does not make you popular, Dale, it makes you sound like a patronizing creep.  This book is probably really handy when you are trying to befriend kindergarteners, not as much adults. It 's also aimed at salespeople and not regular humans. 2 book reviews: Three things about this book surprised me and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  One - it seemed pretty much timeless. Not much anachronism here, because language still serves the same purposes as ever, and people still want basically the same things they have always wanted. I liked the examples taken from Abe Lincoln, etc.  Two - the techniques described in the book are not duplicitous. We all try to do what the title says, just like everyone else, whether we are admitting it to ourselves or not. Readers are repeatedly encouraged to develop genuine interest in others, be honest and ethical, and obey the golden rule.  Three - I enjoyed it (read twice back to back) and it felt easy and natural to apply some of the ideas in my life. Shortly after reading this book, I was a little bit better at communicating and a little bit happier about my interactions with others in general.  3 book reviews: This is a sad book. A book that aims to turn us into manipulating individuals who would want to achieve their means through flattery and other verbal-mental tricks. Even technically, it seems to me that the ploys' in this book would never really work.  Here is a quote from the book -  Do not be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.   And what does the book do? It tries, or at least pretends to turn you into a someone who would flatter everything that moves   so that you get - WHAT YOU WANT.  Most of us read so that we are inspired, moved, even shocked or atleast entertained by stories. We also read so that we understand better and stretch the possibilities of our minds and hearts, to be better human beings. We definitely do not read to become conniving ugly creatures to be held prisoners by our greed. And come on get a grip   this is essentially a sales book.    4 book reviews: I bought this one in 2004 from an Amsterdam bookstore and it has been laying on my bookshelves since then. It 's an icon of self help books and that was a problem because I kind of hate that genre. I decided to get rid of this one as well but not without trying, at least, to see if there is anything of value in it. Well, I was surprised to read some sensible advice and I decided to actually read more. charming in their archaic ways.  So, the book was not total garbage. As I said above, it had some good advice about the subject of win friends and influence people although there was a lot of filler in order to make his principle into a book. Some examples were really interesting others a bit ridiculous.  One of the problems I had with the author and one I find too often in self-help books is the condescending tone, the ones that tells you how smart he is and that she is the only one capable to tell you how success is achieved.  It was an interesting read, I learn some useful skills but it is not groundbreaking anymore in my opinion.  5 book reviews: How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People is a self-help book written by Dale Carnegie, published in 1936.

It is a total of 236 pages but the essence could be boiled down to 12 at most. Every chapter, he has one point summarized in a neat box at the end. I skimmed the rest. He gives you six examples when one or two would do. He deliberately repeats himself. He wastes the readers' time.  Do yourself a favor and just read the \"In a Nutshell\" summary points at the end of each chapter. You wo not miss anything.  7 book reviews: When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.  Dale Carnegie is a quintessentially American type. He is like George F. Babbitt come to life except considerably smarter. And here he presents us with the Bible for the American secular religion: capitalism with a smile.  In a series of short chapters, Carnegie lays out a philosophy of human interaction. The tenets of this philosophy are very simple. People are selfish, prideful, and sensitive creatures. To get along with people you need to direct your actions towards their egos. To make people like you, compliment them, talk in terms of their wants, make them feel important, smile big, and remember their name. If you want to persuade somebody, don t argue, and never contradict them; instead, be friendly, emphasize the things you agree on, get them to do most of the talking, and let them take credit for every bright idea.  The most common criticism lodged at this book is that it teaches manipulation, not genuine friendship. Well, I agree that this book doesn t teach how to achieve genuine intimacy with people. A real friendship requires some self-expression, and self-expression is not part of Carnegie s system. As another reviewer points out, if you use this mindset to try to get real friends, you ll end up in highly unsatisfying relationships. Good friends are not like difficult customers; they are people you can argue with and vent to, people who you do not have to impress.  Nevertheless, I think it s not accurate to say that Carnegie is teaching manipulation. Manipulation is when you get somebody to do something against their own interests; but Carnegie s whole system is directed towards getting others to see that their self-interest is aligned with yours. This is what I meant by calling him the prophet of  capitalism with a smile,  since his philosophy is built on the notion that, most of the time, people can do business with each other that is mutually beneficial. He never advocates being duplicitous:  Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.   Maybe what puts people off is his somewhat cynical view of human nature. He sees people as inherently selfish creatures who are obsessed with their own wants; egotists with a fragile sense of self-esteem:  People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves morning, noon and after dinner.   Well, maybe it 's just because I am an American, but this conception of human nature feels quite accurate to me. Even the nicest people are absorbed with their own desires, troubles, and opinions. Indeed, the only reason that it s easy to forget that other people are preoccupied with their own priorities is because we are so preoccupied with our own that it s hard to imagine anyone thinks otherwise. The other day, for example, I ran into my neighbor, a wonderfully nice woman, who immediately proceeded to unload all her recent troubles on me while scarcely asking me a single question. This isn t because she is bad or selfish, but because she s human and wanted a listening ear. I don t see anything wrong with it.  In any case, I think this book is worth reading just for its historical value. As one of the first and most successful examples of the self-help genre, it is an illuminating document. Already in this book, we have what I call  Self-Help Miracle Stories you know, the stories about somebody applying the lessons from this book and achieving a complete life turnaround. Although the author always insists the stories are real, the effect is often comical:  Jim applied this lesson, and his customer was so happy he named his first-born son after him!   Rebecca impressed her boss so much that he wrote her a check for one million dollars on the spot!   Frank did such a good job at the meeting that one of his clients bought him a Ferrari, and another one offered him his daughter in marriage!  (These are only slight exaggerations.)  Because of this book s age, the writing is quaint and charming. Take, for example, this piece of advice on how to get the most out of the book:  Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.  A lively game! How utterly delightful.  Probably this book would be far more effective if Carnegie included some exercises instead of focusing on anecdotes. But then again, it would be far less enjoyable reading in that case, since the anecdotes are told with such verve and pep (to quote Babbitt). And I think we could all use a little more pep in our lives.  8 book reviews: It 's considered corny to read books like this, but that kind of cynicism is ultimately limiting and counterproductive. My dad forced me to read this book and it was one of the main things that pushed me out of my shyness and made me an amicable person. 9 book reviews: As a seasoned individual who has benefited from the timeless wisdom of this book. I can attest to its enduring relevance in today 's fast-paced world. The audiobook edition brings Carnegie 's insights to life with a level of warmth and authenticity that resonates deeply with listeners. How to Win Friends & Influence People - Audiobook Edition It 's best book ever!  What truly resonates with me about this book is its practicality. Carnegie 's principles, though simple in concept, offer profound insights into the art of building genuine relationships and influencing others positively.  From the importance of showing genuine appreciation to the power of active listening, Carnegie 's teachings have had a transformative impact on how I navigate both personal and professional interactions.  With thousands of positive reviews and a 5-star rating, it 's evident that Carnegie 's principles continue to stand the test of time and resonate with readers of all ages.  10 book reviews: There 's actually some pretty decent advice here that sort of stands the test of time.    But like most self-help books, a lot of the advice does not work in every situation and/or is just flat-out situational.    I also think the part of the book is less about having true friendships than about how to win over a room or how to convince people to see things your way. I would not think that smiling and being agreeable, which is great on the surface and a good way to behave in general, would lend itself to creating strong intimate relationships. Everyone (whether they admit it or not) likes to see a bit of piss and vinegar in the personalities of their friends and lovers.    My two favorite pieces of advice were these:  The author points out that when you humiliate someone their first instinct is to double down and try to prove that whatever they did or are doing is valid. It does not matter how right you are, the vast majority of people do not respond to criticism well at all.     So true. Even if you win, you lose because that person will (once again) be humiliated and not be receptive to what you are trying to do. You may be completely , but you are just shooting yourself in the dick by getting into an argument over things.    You can smugly be , you can swallow that pride and choose to get things . If you want results, try to put yourself in the other person 's place and use a softer hand. No one likes to be embarrassed.    Really the gist of everything this book talks about is just that you need to put yourself in the place of the person you need to win over. What do they want? <--probably recognition and compensation. What would they like to hear? <--praise over what they have done well will likely go a long way to smoothing over any hurt feelings when you discuss what you would like them to do differently.    It also talks about giving sincere compliments and just being the sort of person who de-escalates bad situations. However, as most people already know, it 's impossible (and sort of stupid) to be that person or in every situation. Obviously, there will be times that you need to put your foot down and be firm about what you want. I think this book is just saying that you should try the nice way first.    Now I listened to a revised version, so some of the situations presented were updated. I did not realize this was what I had until Stevie Wonder and a computer company were both used as various examples for something or other. I was like...1930?! I do not think so. I would love-love to read the original text in all of its (I am sure) outdated glory, but I suppose that will have to wait for another day.    I was not expecting to find this such a readable (listenable?) book, but I had no trouble getting through it at all.  Andrew Macmillian - Narrator  11 book reviews: Easy to understand advice for building and improving positive and successful relationships with people in all areas of your life. Not a book per se for making friends, although it certainly can be used that way (with a grain of salt perhaps), but more directly a book that promotes good communication, kindness, and the social skills to foster healthy and productive working relationships.  I can see how some people are taken aback by Carnegie s advice. You have to be in the right frame of mind to truly gain from this book. Go into it with a reflective approach and a genuine and concentrated effort to gain wisdom and you will be rewarded with the insights to achieve the goodwill of others as well as solid and lasting relationships.  12 book reviews: :           ,              1-                        ,                            ,              ,                                              .  2-                  ,                      ,              ,                  .    ,                            ,          ,          .  3-          ,              ,                                                        .                    ,      ,                          .  ,                       \" \",              ,                      / .                    ,                                \"INTJ-T\" ..          ,                  .  4-\"moral high ground fags\"                  ,           .  5-    ,                    ,          ,                                .          .  ***    \"       \"   \"     \"        ...         \"     \"    ,     \"       \"        .        ,        .  ***      ,                  ,              .      ,          :             ***     :             13 book reviews: I really liked this book! I feel like I learned SO much about being a good leader, influencing people, and bettering my social skills. I truly think the lessons I learned in this book will stick with me for life. :) 14 book reviews:  Cl sico de cl sicos! Por la gran calidad del contenido, no es una sorpresa que, tras casi cien a os de la fecha de publicaci n, el libro a n siga siendo vigente y muy popular.  Excelente libro, en verdad me encanta. Esta obra de Carnegie me recuerda a un libro llamado 70 recetas para triunfar en la vida el cual mi madre me regal  hace varios a os porque, en aquel entonces, ella, me sinti  bastante desorientado en mi vida. Recuerdo que result  siendo un gran regalo porque en verdad aquel libro me ayud  mucho para madurar, para ganar confianza, y para creer que todo lo que me proponga en el futuro puedo lograrlo, incluso si parece imposible. Enfrentarme a la vida real nunca fue sencillo para m   de hecho a n tengo complicaciones para adaptarme en ciertas circunstancias  porque yo viv a en una burbuja de irrealidad. Siempre fui el mejor en mi colegio, no sufr  fracasos y/o frustraciones, pero al salir de esa burbuja me estrell  con la realidad y psicol gicamente result  bastante afectado. En unos pocos a os pas  de ser un engre do sabelotodo a un fracasado con depresi n. Fue en aquella lectura que conoc  a Dale Carnegie, ya que en cierto momento del texto se realiza la menci n correspondiente a este autor, y por tanto, mi curiosidad me llev  a investigar y posteriormente a leer este libro. En esa ocasi n tuve una buena experiencia, el libro me gust , aprend  mucho, pero el tiempo fue haci ndome olvidar poco a poco las lecciones aprendidas. Esa es la raz n de mi relectura, incluso es probable que lo vuelva a leer en el futuro: Este tipo de obras se deben retomar cada cierto periodo de tiempo para recordar lo olvidado y tambi n para aprender lecciones nuevas que posiblemente ignoramos en nuestras lecturas previas.  es una gran obra que nos ayuda a reflexionar sobre los errores que cometemos cuando tratamos a nuestro pr jimo. Todo el libro est  cargado de historias, frases y lecciones; bellas lecciones que por su sencillez calan hondamente en nosotros, bellas lecciones que nos hace recapacitar sobre nuestro comportamiento, nuestras palabras, y la forma como nos relacionamos con los dem s. Leer esta obra sirve para darnos cuenta que las personas no somos robots, y que en todas las ocasiones donde actuamos con antipat a, groser a, y agresividad, realmente hemos tratado a las personas como basura, y nadie, absolutamente nadie se lo merece. Carnegie nos invita a comprender al pr jimo, a ganarnos su confianza, a ser amables, simp ticos, y especialmente a interesarnos con genuinidad en ellos. Carnegie nos invita a ser m s humanos, nos invita a madurar, nos invita a seguir el ejemplo de cientos y miles de personas que por su buena comunicaci n tienen grandes amigos y  xito en sus vidas. Carnegie escribi  esta obra para ayudarnos a ser mejores humanos.  Como sus lecciones son pr cticas y prometen buenos resultados, es recomendable no leer esta obra tan r pido, sino preferiblemente intentar practicar, poco a poco, los buenos h bitos propuestos por el autor. Tambi n es recomendable realizar muchas anotaciones porque de no hacerlo, nos perderemos las ense anzas que en el libro aparecen, y como son tantas, entonces se vuelve una tarea imposible memorizarlas todas juntas. Si leemos esta obra como un libro normal, podr amos acabarlo en unas pocas horas, pero si deseamos emplear estos consejos en nuestra vida, lo recomendable es leer poca informaci n en un solo d a. Si desean leerlo al azar, tambi n pueden hacerlo, no hay ning n problema con ello.  La din mica del libro es bastante pragm tica. El autor nos cuenta una historia de un vendedor, presidente, pol tico, comerciante, etc., y como una f bula, nos deja en cada una de ellas una moraleja importante; moraleja que va fortaleciendo en las siguientes historias del mismo cap tulo. Eso me ha llevado a pensar que quiz s la cantidad de ejemplos pueden llegar a ser exagerados. Con dos o tres ejemplos podr a ser suficiente, en mi opini n, pero cinco o seis ejemplos que refuerzan la misma idea me parece algo innecesario. L gicamente, no todas las historias impresionan a todas las personas de igual manera, por lo que comprendo que su objetivo es presentar historias diversas, ya que se supondr a que alguna tendr a que ayudar al lector a reflexionar. Este tipo de historias, y forma en que son narradas, me recuerda a las que se les cuenta a los ni os para que aprendan a ser puntuales, responsables, dormir temprano, etc. Son escritas de una forma tan simple, sin atacar al lector por tener fallas o errores, y se siente una paciencia y una compresi n tan alta en las palabras que me hace pensar que debi  ser muy agradable entablar una conversaci n real con este se or. Una persona que te escucha, no te juzga, es amable contigo, y a la vez te da consejos sin ofenderte, es un amigo de verdad. Si t , que est s leyendo esto, conoces a alguien as , cuida mucho esa amistad, es dif cil encontrar alguien que est  dispuesto a gastar su tiempo en ti.  Aunque no estoy de acuerdo con las lecturas obligatorias, pienso que esta obra s  deber a serlo. Con tanta agresividad, odio e indiferencia, que hay por todas partes en el mundo, siento que este libro podr a ayudar much simo a reducir la cantidad de peleas y problemas de convivencia que se viven en todos los  mbitos posibles: Trabajos, colegios, universidades, hogar, etc. No s  ustedes, pero a m  me parece tan molesto salir a caminar a la calle, con el objetivo de cambiar de ambiente, descansar, quiz s meditar, y as  respirar un aire m s saludable, pero en vez de calmarnos resultamos llegando a nuestro destino m s estresados de lo que est bamos. Tantas peleas, gritos, intolerancia, y esc ndalo por todas partes, es tan, pero tan molesto, que incluso pierdo las ganas de salir en muchas ocasiones. Debemos contactarnos con el mundo exterior, relacionarnos, caminar, y dem s, porque somos seres sociales por naturaleza, pero a veces el escenario no ayuda mucho para motivarnos a hacerlo. Quiz s si leyeran este libro por obligaci n no lo practicar an, seguir amos siempre con los mismos malos h bitos, pero tal vez valdr a la pena para intentar germinar la semilla de la duda en algunas personas que, a lo mejor, puede que si tengan la disposici n para cambiar sus malos h bitos y actitudes. En los momentos en que se sientan furiosos, fren ticamente descontrolados, y tengan deseos de explotar violentamente sobre los dem s, en esos casos, les recomiendo que primero lean un rato este libro, y si despu s de hacerlo a n tienen deseos de ser violentos, bien pueden terminar su cometido; pero, es probable, que su ira se reduzca mucho porque leyendo este libro comprendemos que somos tan culpables como los dem s cuando una conversaci n se sale de control.  Cuando lees este libro sientes la curiosidad de practicar lo que te propone el autor, y lo mejor es que puedes hacerlo en cualquier situaci n cotidiana de tu vida: Desde hablar con un ni o para que te obedezca, o hablar con tu jefe para pedirle un aumento. Este libro puede ayudarte, como su t tulo lo dice, a influir sobre las personas, pero a pesar de ello no encontrar s consejos de c mo manipular a las personas, o aprovecharte de ellos. No. Lo que encontrar s ser  un libro que te har  entender que s  deseas que alguien te siga, o  te haga caso , debes preocuparte por su bienestar y no solo por el tuyo. Influir sanamente en los dem s comprende un intercambio equivalente para ambas partes.  En la parte final se cuenta la vida de Dale Carnegie, y entonces es all  donde sentimos m s simpat a con el autor porque comprendemos que es igual que nosotros, con sus problemas, sus sue os y dificultades, y que es un gran ejemplo a seguir porque lo que  l hizo fue seguir su pasi n para dedicarse de por vida a lo que siempre dese  hacer: Ser un conferencista. Es una historia muy bonita que me ha gustado mucho, la he rele do varias veces  incluso en este momento mientras escribo esta rese a , y entre m s la leo m s me encanta su historia de superaci n.  En resumen, un libro muy bueno que nos ayuda a crecer. Lo leer  varias veces a lo largo de mi vida, y de cada lectura estoy seguro que aprender  nuevas lecciones porque aprender a tratar a los dem s es un camino interminable, y muy dif cil de seguir, pero intentar transitarlo vale la pena porque nos traer  grandes beneficios, no solo econ micos, sino de todo tipo. Sigue estos consejos y estar s siempre rodeado de grandes amigos, sigue estos consejos y no tendr s enemigos, sigue estos consejos y nunca estar s solo, sigue estos consejos y tendr s una mano amiga que estar  siempre dispuesta a ayudarte.  15 book reviews:  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.    How to win friends and influence people  is one of the best self-help books I read in 2018. It s a very popular book that I managed to avoid for years simply because I thought it might have clich  advice that I d probably already know and I won t find anything useful. Boy, was I wrong! It definitely has pieces of advice you probably have heard a million times already, from your parents, teachers or just any adult; you listen and get inspired for like 15 minutes but you don t spend time pondering on it and it s forgotten. I guess you need to be in a certain state of mind to absorb opinions and ideas. This book had me in that state and was able to hold my attention throughout.  One of the most important things I took away from this book was  Give unto others what we would have others give unto us . Now, I know everybody knows that! We, humans, are complex creatures; we have different personalities, temperaments, motivations but when everything is taken away, there are some core values that are similar in all of us. Our actions spring from what we desire, we crave appreciation, feeling of importance, and we want to be respected and listened to. This book tells you to peer into your mind and learn about yourself.  It s really important to get to know yourself first, to know what you like and what you don t. In order to influence people, you need to put yourself in their shoes and approach the situation in that way. This takes tactfulness and patience. The author also makes use of wise quotes from philosophers and great people to explain his ideas, which I really liked. He also gives examples from the lives of successful people to elaborate his point and also, gives pointers on how to incorporate those pieces of advice in our daily lives. Every advice given in this book is valuable, no matter how commonplace it is. I believe this book should be a necessary read for students in school and college.  All in all, it was very informative and useful book. There were so many great advises you could use in your daily life. I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their lives because it s really worth your time.   16 book reviews: 1    Holy hell! Give it a rest, Dale! (H)Why, oh hwhy, did I read this?! Carnegie s principles display, boldly, the many wrinkles of their age but it s not only that; it s very hard to believe that this book/course was ever considered useful information, nay, even anything beyond laughable, by any self-respecting individual!   To summarise a few select points:  1. Remember, and relentlessly repeat, the victim s name during conversation. That sweet, sweet nectar that is one s own name will have them eating out of the palm of your hand.  2. Smile. Preferably a manic, unnerving smile with cheeks quivering and teeth buckling under 1200psi of clench. Hold this smile throughout entire conversation, even hwhile talking. People love a smile!!  3. Shut your piehole! For the love of god NEVER, under any circumstances, talk about something you re interested in! Speak only of the other person s interests as if it were the most fascinating thing you ve ever heard... And do it  genuinely  damn it! Oh, and make them feel really important; lay it on thick, y know?!  Oh, you re a woodworking hobbiest and you personally made your office desk from American Hwhite Oak?! Oh Stan, you re an absolute marvel!! Do take up the next 3.5 hours of my time discussing the finer details of this thrilling pastime, Stan!  or  HAHAHAHA! *maintaining manic smile* Oh Barry, you are literally the funniest and most important person I ve spoken to in years, Barry! You mean to tell me, Barry, that hwhen it s a bit quiet in here you just sit and watch all manner of marvelously funny cat videos on youtube?! Splendid! Oh, another? sure I ve got time! HWhat could be more pressing?! This is just great, you re great Barry!  Oh, and obviously make sure you do all of this sincerely, we re not just trying to superficially flatter people here, c mon whattya take me for?!  4. If you re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically!... Hell, even if you know for sure that you re not wrong, it couldn t hurt to act like you might be.  5. Dramatize your ideas. If you sell, say, cash registers for example. Next time you go into the neighborhood grocery store, randomly point out to the owner how positively shit his current cash registers are and explain that he is literally hemorrhaging cash every time he uses them instead of your superior product. Don t just tell him though, raise your voice and make a scene. Begin throwing coins on the floor and then at the cashier screaming,  Can t you see you re literally throwing away money, Gary?!! . Always use the name Gary, even if you know full well that s not his/her name.   Self-serving, underhanded and insincere! You can smell the Carnegie training on furniture and used car salesmen from a mile away. Carnegie courses must ve been like factories churning out greasy, mass-produced slimeballs whose false kindness and counterfeit smiles, rather than achieving the desired level of endearment, come across passive aggressive and condescending to any moderately discerning conversationalist. Just repeatedly, and self-righteously, claiming that you are honest, sincere and most definitely NOT advocating a bag of cheap and flattering tricks, doesn t make it so... Though, evidently, it does make you rich!  17 book reviews: This book is a life changer ! Really, I am not making this up. This was exactly what I needed. Some things that are described in this book I realized before reading this book, but there were a lot of things I never thought about myself but are so true. I do not like conflicts and I found a lot of tips in this book about this topic..so how not to be in fights with people. Yaaay, my zen is safe! =) 18 book reviews: This was really the world 's first self-help book and undoubtedly helped many people build their self-esteem. It is easy to read and its tenants are easy to follow. The one criticism that many have justly laid on it is the feeling that you are manipulating people into being your friends or accomplices (thus the \"win\" in the title). As such, the techniques work with a subpopulation of people you run into over the span of your life nut certainly not all of them. And true friendships are about depth and mutual respect so no techniques are required. A more appropriate use of the book is how to behave and fit in in corporate America and for that, other than losing the tie and the hat, manners and ambitions have not changed so much for the book to become irrelevant. I prefer Getting Things Done personally.  19 book reviews: Tiene mucho m rito escribir un libro as  en 1936 y es absolutamente necesario ponerlo en el contexto de la  poca. El uso del lenguaje no est  acorde a los c nones del siglo XXI, por ejemplo. A n as , he aprendido mucho y he de decir que intentar  poner en pr ctica muchas de las ense anzas que he le do. Todo es muy  til y est  revestido con un ligero toque de ingenuidad. ---------  There is much merit in writing such a book in 1936 and it is absolutely necessary to put it in the context of the time. The use of language is not in keeping with 21st century canons, for example. Still, I have learned a lot and I must say that I will try to put into practice many of the lessons I have read. It is all very useful and overlaid with a slight touch of naivety.  20 book reviews: Sometimes I felt this book was a bit too . . . \"used-car-salesmanshippy\". There are some good ideas in it, but there are also some things which felt like they were extremely disingenuous. I do not like FAKE people. There are some ideas in here which are quite fake. 21 book reviews: Reading between the lines and paying attention to the biographical details you realise that Carnegie never was a successful salesman himself. Success only came late in life when he was teaching an evening school class on the topic of how to win friends and influence people. His students would share their stories about changes in thinking or attitude which had changed their lives, these then made their way in to the book. Once the book was published readers would send in their own stories which were added to later editions.  As a result the book is a collection of anecdotes, many of which have people changing their circumstances or changing their lives by changing the way they thought, but all the same you think that the unending pile of washing up featured in one story always remains an unending pile of washing up whether you enjoy it, despise it, value it or feel oppressed by it. Still, the book keys into a timeless message that you may not be able to change reality, but you can certainly change the way you think about it .  On the sinister side this is a book that celebrates positive thinking, which is to say that it ignores a realistic appraisal of the world in favour of having your cake and eating it, on one level this is a fairly harmless book on another it tends towards and the belief that others and oneself are to blame if you die when a ferry sinks, or if you are persecuted, or if you develop cancer because plainly such things only happen because you were not positive enough . Barbara Ehrenreich discusses this all very nicely in .  It is only a short book and wo not harm you if you give it a read, but despite the title does not have a lot of advice on how to win friends or influence people. A good book to lend to people with a big smile as they will suspect that you are trying to win their friendship and/or influence them the beerfree way.  22 book reviews: This book is a guide to life. I think several people should be required to read this book at least once. Teachers, emotional teenagers, employers, employees, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, friends, neighbors, politicians etc...  I truly found this book oddly entertaining. Although it is a self-improvement type book, I could not put it down. Through the examples of many famous and successful people throughout history, this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice. I sincerely believed that my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved exponentially through reading this book and putting what I learned into action.  I love this book and am going to require that my children read it before they get a job, a drivers' license, or a date.   23 book reviews: Overall: A well written book with a lot of examples, including many of good folks from the history and many without any citation, but none-the-less seem real. The examples are written so that the message goes across well. Repetition is avoided. The stuff mentioned is pretty obvious and simple, but important and often ignored. Worth reading multiple times as the preface recommends.  TEXT DELETED  105 SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU PRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2: Smile PRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person s interests. PRINCIPLE 6: Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely. 110 You cannot win an argument Why not let him save his face? He didn t ask for your opinion. He didn t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle. Don t forget this lesson! I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument and that is to avoid it. You can t win an argument. You can t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will always resent your triumph and  a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still  112 Which would you rather have, an academic theatrical victory or a person s good will? You can seldom have both. Buddha said,  Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,  and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation, and a sympathetic desire to see the other person s viewpoint. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cute the bite. 114 How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument: 1. Welcome the disagreement: Remember the slogan,  When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.  If there is some point you haven t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. 2. Distrust your first instinctive impressions: Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not at your best. 3. Control your temper: Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. 4. Listen first; Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend, or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. 5. Look for areas of agreement: When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. 6. Be honest: Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. 7. Promise to think over your opponents  ideas and study them carefully: and mean it! Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say:  We tried to tell you, but you wouldn t listen.  8. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest: Anyone who takes the time to adisagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. 9. Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem: Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear to preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions. Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, what the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me? PRINCIPLE 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.  MORE LATER...  24 book reviews: Why did I read this book?  We ve all heard of it. But none of us have ever really read it.  And I know why. It was originally published in 1936. How can it possibly be relevant in 2009?  Plus these types of advice, self-help, new-agey textbooks reek of banal, trite, clich d, stereotypical drivel. We re too good for that. They seem a little cheesy at least. They re all like The Secret, right?  We don t want to sip on watered down hotel iced tea and listen to Zig Ziglar. We want to take a toke of a high-grade sativa strain and listen to some Creedence tapes!  Regardless of my skepticism and cynicism, I found How to Win Friends and Influence People to be extremely applicable and relevant.  First of all, a note on the title:  How to Win Friends  is not accurate. It s not at all about winning friends in the sense that we modern youths would consider a friend. Carnegie seems  how to win friends  to mean the  accumulation of calculated, beneficial relationships.   I feel very strongly that  friends  are the people we can be dicks to, the people we can get drunk with, yell at, act stupid, and not have to worry about the third of six ways to make people like you (remember their name). Everyone else? Everyone else you re actually nice to (bosses, co-workers, certain family members, people you pass on the street) are not friends. Friends are the people you can tell to fuck off and they ll still drive you to the airport at 6am the next day. This book is how to deal with everyone else with seemingly-obvious principles such as smile, be a good listener, talk in terms of other people s interests, and make the other person feel important.  So friends, not so much. But how to influence people, yes.  Carnegie s seminal work is packed full of anecdotal evidence illuminating the principle of each chapter and reinforced with a healthy peppering of Emerson quotes:   Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.   Though written in 1936, HTWFAIF is refreshingly relevant in a modern age marked by the dichotomy between incredible scientific accomplishments, brilliant discoveries, understanding, knowledge, curiosity, but yet a stunted ability to talk and peacefully coexist with those we disagree.  Take, for instance, Carnegie s encouragement to dramatize your intentions in order for them to be recognized and accepted:   This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.   And on the eighth day, God created cable news.  Carnegie thwarts our skepticism about the nobility of his intentions and promises that he is no self-help scammer, a Kevin Trudeau, Carnegie promises, he is not:   The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.   And for the most part, I have to agree with Carnegie. I like this book. Its advice and suggestions are totally useful and effective. We tend to consider ourselves living in grim times, what with the wars, crumbling economy, job losses, and uncertain future, why not have a little possitivity and engaged enthusiasm for our fellow man?  And Carnegie even foretold a danger in our current time. He warns us of Obama:   The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.   Uh oh.  25 book reviews: 4.0    GENRE - NON FICTION/SELF HELP.  This book was published in 1936 which makes it quite a old book to read, the author has made a good attempt in explaining how you can actually win friends and influence people with the help of Stories, examples and quotes.  Altough I had too much of high expectations from this book however the points discussed in the book did convince to a great extent what are the important factors to influence the opposite person, I personally facing a lot of issues in relationships due to the bluntness in my speech was able to find answers to a certain extent.  Well it 's a self help book at the end of the day, this book shall suit your cause unless and until you honestly accept your shortcomings and practice what has been preached in this book on your surroundings.  Thank you    26 book reviews: I have heard, I wash told, I have read how amazing 'The Book' of Dale Carnegie for years and always wanted to read it. And I finally did. And it came nothing short of living up to the world class reputation it has. Mr. Carnegie explains the concepts behind influencing people, not as a bag of tricks, but as a true way of life. All the chapters contain highly self-explanatory examples to help readers understand each principle. In my opinion, this is one of the books one must read in his or her lifetime, preferably at the earliest.  27 book reviews: 5/5   Sin dudas una joya de libro, ideal para potenciar o desarrollar tus habilidades blandas, un libro corto pero con un gran potencial para tu vida si aplicas lo ense ado!

My feelings have changed but I am keeping this up for the fun of it.  As most of you know this is not the type of book I normally reach for, so it should be no surprise that my dad recommended it. He 's a huge fan, so for whatever reason I decided to give it a shot. This is by no means a bad book, but since we are on the topic, I will mention the cons first. I skimmed through the latter half of this book today. The first half took me over a month. This is not boring per se, I just happen to have the attention span of your average Millennial. I have the worst patience (as in non-existent) to boot. If I am not constantly entertained by something and it takes longer than ten seconds, I get irritable. This book was full of real life examples. Whenever you thought it would finish, another would come.    A lot of the principles are obvious, but let 's be honest. Am I going to apply any of them to my life? Nope.    The thing is, I do not want to win friends and influence people. I want to avoid people and take long solitary walks. I do not want to influence anyone because I am a bad influence. My tactic for gaining friends is very simple.         This method works wonders and leaves me nearly friendless. How I influence people is slightly more corrupt so I wo not go into that. In the end there 's not many wonderful things I can say about this book. Still, I do not feel like it 's bad. It 's just not for me personally.   ",
    " It Ends with Us: A Novel (1)": "book reviews: A pesar de que me gusto la historia, la forma en la que se narra algunas veces no tanto. Es un libro con un tema que siento no se toca muchas veces y de alguna manera te hace sentir empat a por cada uno de los personajes de la historia. Para mi cumpli  las expectativas que ten a de  l y en cierta parte me sorprendi  porque no investigu  mucho sobre  l antes de leerlo as  que realmente no sab a mucho de que iba, pero es lo que es, un libro para leer en esos raros que quieras despejar tu mente y desconectar un rato.  1 book reviews: Excellent read. Good to the very end 2 book reviews: This was at time a little slow but overall an emotional thriller. Emotional up 's and downs...I cried, I felt all the feels, and I smiled. I hope others find Lily 's strength. 3 book reviews: This was my second time reading - such a good story!!! ",
    " My First Library : Boxset of 10 Board Books for Kids": "book reviews: Meh. I get that baby books are not particularly complex, but these just feel kind of slapped-together with random words and stock images, like no one put much thought into the order of words or what kids might be learning from them.  For instance, there 's overlap between some of the books, so the same words appear in multiple books (some with the same pictures, some different); the \"farm animals & pets\" one frustrates me because the first pages juxtapose the male & female (bull & cow) but subsequent pages do not follow that pattern-- sometimes the animals are similar (duck & goose), sometimes they are not. It 's all fine, but does not actually lend itself to language development in the way that a more structured book could.  1 book reviews: Good set of picture books for kids 0-5 years. For kids of first two years the pages can be good as visual aids to recognize objects and animals. For older kids, these can be easy learning tools.  Since this Canadian product, contents depicted are appropriate for American continent users than other parts of the world. The authors could have used globally appealing generic contents instead. Therefore, 4 instead of 5 stars.  2 book reviews: A pretty cool series of little board books. They include more detailed sets of words than some of the other word books Lily has, like the names of different kinds of birds, etc.  She did not have any other books on shapes, so we read that one first. It was kind of weird that all of the shapes were two-dimensional except \"cone,\" but overall, decent books.  3 book reviews: I bought this set of books as a birthday present for my two year old granddaughter. She already lovess to have someone read to her and these are very sturdy little books made for a two year old to handle easily. She loves the colorful pictures as well. 4 book reviews: A must buy for your baby readers. Small for little hands with vibrant colors and simplicity for attraction. 5 book reviews: Great books to teach kids ! ",
    " Oh, the Places You'll Go!": "book reviews: All my life I ve had an outstandingly risible optimism. My Mom started me young - she gave me the ole Seuss spirit. Never say die, boys!  Yep. She had that ne er-say-die Seuss spirit in spades, especially when she d half-sing, half peal out... like a ringing Angelus Bell...  One more river And that s the River Jordan! One more river An  that s the river to cross!  Growing up, whenever  authority  and  would-be authority  would turn up the heat under my feet, I danced through it all.  An easy victim perhaps, though somehow I had faith that somehow everything would turn out in the end.  Sometimes the happy ending was just too embarrassed to show up in person in my life!  But I just kept on slogging.  Oh, the places you ll GO!  And you ll find  em alright, those places -  Not all of them pleasant - by ANY stretch of the imagination.  But you ll make it through the storm - and you ll SHINE ON, kid!  They re forecasting rain? Well, the Kingdom of Oz is just over that rainbow... see it?  There s a Bluebird on my shoulder... It s the truth. It s actual - Everythin  is SATISFACTUAL!  When you tumble down through the roaring flood Down, down into the fearsome sluice Just boogie on down - cause the Lord, He Loves ya! ( Ditto!  says doughty old Dr. Seuss!)  Oh, the Places you ve BEEN!  You know, these days I m into Emily Colson s incredible story of how she endured so many extraordinarily painful years of parenting a severely handicapped, hopelessly autistic son, Max.  How did she cope?  She realized, one landmark day, that in spite of all his tormented flaws, she deeply, hopelessly LOVED that lost little bundle of Sheer Joy!  That was the day she discovered his and her Humanity. But you know what her REALLY big insight was?  It came later on.  Suddenly... she knew she was REALLY, HONESTLY PROUD of this mixed-up little kid. So proud, in fact, that she wanted to take him - and her absolute doting love for him - PUBLIC!  That s right.  They were both once again gonna be card-carrying members of the Human Race.  Bullies, Begone!  Who CARES what the bullies say or do? Love is REAL.  Cause we re ALL hopeless in our ways... EACH ONE of us.  And we re ALL LOVABLE in our broken humanity, too, to the Big Guy up There! And He ll take care of us.  OH, THE PLACES YOU LL GO, NOW!  Not being perfect. Not being socially acceptable in your allotted role. Not being fixable. No.  Being Brokenly, Happily Human.  Being just our Lost, Lovable, Flawed Selves...  Know WHY? ...because He LOVES Us - Because we re Ourselves. And the Bullies are Crude Fa ades. Cartoons of themselves.  And that s how she, and I, and everyone who s gotta heart always know EVERYTHING will be OK in the end.  Oh, the PLACES WE VE BEEN!  IN SPITE OF the Mad Grinch, the Monstrous Oobleck, even that Evil Cat in the Hat - We DID it, kid!  ALL BY OURSELVES.  And with a Whole TRUCKLOAD of Loving Help from Upstairs.  1 book reviews: \"It 's opener there in the wide open air.  Out there things can happen and frequently do to people as brainy and footsy as you.  And then things start to happen, do not worry. Do not stew. Just go right along. You will start happening too.\"  -Dr. Seuss   I had never read this book from cover to cover, but I was familiar with it from quotes used in speeches and publications. The dean of our college read us a passage to close the graduation ceremony, and even then I did not appreciate how appropriate that passage was for someone entering the real world.  I had forgotten about this book until just recently when I came across a copy and began to read to pass the time. Upon finishing, I was surprised and deeply touched at how simple yet sincere the book 's message was. While the book is cute and very appropriate for children, I think it takes an adult to understand and sympathize with the message. The book talks about our journey through life, with all its disappointments and happiness, its unpredictability and uncertainty. As someone who was recently faced with difficult personal and professional choices that veered from plans established years before, I especially took much of this book to heart.  I will return to this book again and again in the future. It 's a book that reminds you life is hard and can be lonely, but that despite the difficulties, we can all persevere. The words are simple and upbeat, but behind the colorful images is an unflinching optimism that inspires.   2 book reviews: Oh, The Places You will Go!, Dr. Seuss  The story begins with the narrator, relating the decision of the unnamed protagonist (who represents the reader) to leave town.  The protagonist travels through several geometrical and poly-chromatic landscapes and places, eventually encountering a place simply called \"The Waiting Place\", which is ominously addressed as being a place where everyone is always waiting for something to happen.  As the protagonist continues to explore, spurred on by the thoughts of places he will visit and things he will discover, the book cheerfully concludes with an open end.       :           2014     :            !  :     (       )   :                  1392    32    9789643699185      1393          -   20                                                                                    .                                                         .                               .                                                         .                                    :                      ...                                                                                       .   !                                                      .             07/06/1399     .    3 book reviews: This is my All-Time-Number-One-Favorite children 's book. Period. I have read it to my kids so many times over the years that you would think I would be immune to it by now. But I am not. I still get all EMOTIONAL when I read it. Which, normally, would make me run in the opposite direction. But.         Yep. That 's exactly what I want for my young'uns!       Noooo! Now they are stuck in a LURCH! Which is pretty frickin' scary for a parent! Nobody wants their babies to get stuck in a LURCH, because those inevitably lead to SLUMPS! And . It takes a while to un-slump, and in the meantime they could end up in The Waiting Place.           Thankfully, (according to Seuss) they will somehow escape the Waiting Place.    Yes! They will be ok!            At this point, I am usually bleary-eyed, in case you were curious. And exactly is this guy a of, anyway?! He 's certainly not Dr. Feelgood!           Holy Shit! What if I am not there to help them through all of this!? They have got sore arms and leaky sneakers, for God 's sake! Mommy 's coming, sweetheart!          I am slinging snot everywhere by the time I get to this part. Seriously, Seuss? You are me!       I am usually nothing more a puddle of sniveling Mom-goo, as my voice cracks on the last line. And whatever unfortunate kid I happen to be reading to is simultaneously trying to comfort me, while also trying to escape my vice-like grip.            4 book reviews: A gift on my high school graduation... something I will always treasure. It answers all of life 's questions for a young one trying to decide their future!  As a children 's book, the rhyming and cartoon-like at helps keep focused attention. But it 's the words that are so simple, yet so evocative in their minds. Certain stanzas stay with you. People quote it both in fun and in sincerity when thinking about what to do.  It 's books like this that help children figure out that reading is not just educational, it 's fun. I do not have children, but I have read it to a few younger cousins and some kids I babysat from time to time. The expressions on their face make it worth it.  Give it a shot as an adult if you never did as a child.  5 book reviews: All aboard!!!   FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!  Congratulations!        No wonder this was the last tale by Dr. Seuss while he was alive (there are two more books, published posthumously)    and I am sure that he is now visting great places!  This is a charming tale about the journey of each of us in our lives, ...  ...what I really liked was that Dr. Seuss don t lie to us.  He exposes during the rhythmic narrative, that not everything will be peaches-and-ice-cream in life, that we ll have enjoyable moments in life, ...  ...also testing times, we ll have happy events, but also sad crisis, along the journey, not matter if good or bad, if we keep walking forward, we always will be meeting new places, new people, new moments    building full and complete lives.  What are you still doing here?  Engage!  You have places to go!!!    6 book reviews: Written for children from age 1 to 100. Embrace new adventures and changes in your life! 7 book reviews:  You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.    I was not expecting a kid s book to be so incredibly profound?? This picture book follows an unnamed narrator ( You ) as they take off on the journey called life. This journey takes them through indecision, anxiety, loneliness and failure - but also excitement, triumph and happiness.  This was a really beautiful story. I loved that it wasn t sugar-coating things for kids. Seuss understood that hard times happen, and he wanted kids to prepare without being scared.  While I loved it, the four-year-old I was reading to also loved it. The rhyme-scheme flowed very well and the word-play was fun. I didn t mind reading this one each time small-fry asked.   8 book reviews: I never enjoyed Dr. Seuss books. They never  'spoke' to me. Just a bunch of silly rhymes and ok illustrations. However, they seem to have inspired the sort of devotion in some people the endless trolls I get on The Lorax that I have for the original pre-Disney A.A. Milne Winnie The Pooh books but I do not troll those who do not like them. This book was no exception. What fans call 'whimsical', I call 'cutsie' and sugary-sweet and very unappealing. Perhaps that is why Disney books are so popular in the US and A.A. Milne with his irascible Eeyore and annoyingly mother-y Kanga are still more popular in the UK?  When my son was too young to understand the sense of words but liked the rhyme, I read him and other poetry with fun rhythms. I do not think it would have made any difference if I had read him Seuss instead, but it made a big difference to me, I enjoyed reading Hiawatha out loud. Seuss, not so much.  9 book reviews: How did I ever miss this gem! Love Dr. Seuss! 10 book reviews: Dr. Seuss is clearly the true essence of children s books as he writes about life in a playful and lyrical way that children can easily understand. Well,  Oh, the Places You ll Go!  is definitely no exception as it is about believing in yourself as you go out into the world.  Oh, the Places You ll Go!  is easily a book that every child should read whenever he or she are in a slump!  Basically, this book is about taking charge of your own life facing difficulties in your life such as loneliness, fear, and confusion, with a straight face and taking on life ahead of you in a lyrical prose that children will easily appreciate!  Oh my goodness! There are so many things that I loved about this book that it would take me all day to list them! For one thing, Dr. Seuss  writing is clearly more memorable in this book as he tells children who are on their way to facing life ahead of them on their own to have positive attitudes and face their fears head on! I just loved the way that Dr. Seuss showed the upside and downside attributes of life all in a lyrical prose as the writing was truly creative and inspirational. I never would have thought that I would find a book about the tough trials of life that is so well-written and whenever I read this book, I think about the hardships I had to endure during my life, but then I realize that life always has its ups and downs and only you can decide what to make of your life, which is what Dr. Seuss has shown in this book. Probably my favorite verse in this book was this line:       This was a truly powerful verse for me because it is saying that there will be times where you can succeed, but sometimes when you do not believe in yourself, you end up losing the game or not succeeding at all. Dr. Seuss  illustrations are just as creative and surreal in this book as the main character is a young boy who wears a yellow jumpsuit and a yellow hat. The world that surrounds the boy is extremely surreal as the hills and the grounds are in multicolored stripes and the creatures that the boy meets along the way are also bizarre, especially of the image of the boy meeting a huge green monster that has black stripes on its body and short yellow bushy tail.  All in all,  Oh, the Places You ll Go!  is easily one of Dr. Seuss  best works ever created and it should be read to any child who graduates from school! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.   11 book reviews: WrensReads Review:    THIS BOOK HAS SUCH DEEP MEANINGS IN IT.  It touches on anxiety and depression like you would not believe, but in a nice way.  It wants you to get up! Go out! Do the things you want to do! Do not Wait! Do not fright! You have to go and do you!  Seriously Wren, stop rhyming.    He touches on things involving how things wo not go your way and you will get down. Or you will be worried you picked the wrong path. He continues on why it is okay and that it will be alright! I think this is important to read to kids. They should memorize this book.  Everyone should own, memorize and live by this book.  | | |  12 book reviews: Upon the graduation of my firstborn last weekend, I decided to really read this book for the first time. I read many Dr. Seuss books to him over the years, but somehow this one never made it home with us.  What can I say? It 's pretty amazing how deep truths can be conveyed in such simple rhymes. Seuss warns of setbacks in life, the danger of getting stuck in the dreaded \"waiting place,\" the inevitability of lonely times, and the importance of remembering that life is a \"Great Balancing Act.\" Simply brilliant!  Excerpt:  Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So...  13 book reviews:  One of the most important books I have ever read  It 's so damn inspiring! I would like to say it 's not just for kids. Like we all love 'The Little Prince' at different stages of our life, this book also serves as an important eye opening one for us (when we happen to lack motivation now and then). This one will give you different perspectives on life on how to move forward. The illustration is so damn amazing! I felt like I was flying while reading this book. Totally one of the best reads   14 book reviews: You can t go wrong with Dr Seuss when it comes to kids books. They love these books and will want to hear them over and over again. 15 book reviews: This is a children 's story book, but reading this feels like Dr. Seuss not only wrote this for young readers. He also deliberately target adult readers because the way it gives hope; it reminds us of the challenges and the success we might experienced on our journey in our lives. 16 book reviews: ...a most useless place: The Waiting Place...  ...for people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go or a bus to come, or a plane to go or the mail to come, or the rain to go or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow or the waiting around for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" or waiting for their hair to grow [or, in the most cases, waiting for Godot!] Everyone is just waiting.  NO! That 's not for you!  Somehow you will escape all that waiting and staying You will find the bright places where Boom Bands are playing!  17 book reviews: Now first of all let me explain from the start that I love Dr. Seuss, he had such a good heart. His stories are nonsense but also have meaning, the wisdom found here is quite surely worth gleaning.  Some say it 's for children; they will love it a lot, but it 's everyone 's book, so do not think that it 's not. In fact I would say that while kids love the tale, the adults will understand more, without fail.  It 's once you have been through this life fully grown that you understand not just the pictures alone, or the rhymes with good rhythm, the pacing well paced but the hard bits and problems that humans must face.  But it also gives hope and support to the reader, lets them feel quite successful, a star and a leader - that they too can decide where their life wants to go; reassures them it 's fine if they really do not know.  So please read this book at top haste and full speed, but the actual book, not just posts on Goodreads; the pictures are needed along with the text... ...but I will stop rhyming here so you wo not all get vexed. :]  What else can I say, the man was a genius. A very short but inspiring and relatable tale. Highly recommended.  18 book reviews: One of my favourite Dr. Seuss books! I gave a copy to each one of my children when they graduated from high school! 19 book reviews:  for people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go or a bus to come, or a plane to go or the mail to come, or the rain to go or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow or waiting around for a Yes or a No or waiting for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting.  Waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite or waiting around for Friday night or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake or a pot to boil, or a Better Break or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants or a wig with curls, or Another Chance. Everyone is just waiting.          You have brains in your head.  You have feet in your shoes.  You can steer yourself  Any direction you choose.  You re on your own. And  you know what you know.  And YOU are the guy who ll decide where to go.    You ll get mixed up,  of course, as you  already know.  You ll get mixed up  with many strange birds  as you go.  So be sure when you step.  Step with care and great  tact and remember that    Life s A Great  Balancing Act.    And will you succeed?  Yes! You will, indeed!  (98 and   percent guaranteed.)  KID, YOU LL MOVE  MOUNTAINS!   20 book reviews: A book for children and adults, it celebrates and instructs the reader on life 's possible journey as you make your decisions along the way. Some of your journey will be adventurous and bright, while it may also be confusing, waiting, dark and scary. But, \"You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.\" And in the end, \"KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!\"  This upbeat book about life 's adventures and trials will entertain as well as educate readers. The cartoon-like illustrations keep the reader engaged with the texts. The rhyming keeps a jingle in the mind of the little character 's journey on the pages. This book gives hope to the reader about the life decisions they will make along the way. Great for graduation or when the child is at a turning point in their life. Highly recommended.  21 book reviews: THIS SIMPLE CHILDREN'S BOOK IS   This book has more depth, more heart, and is more inspiring than a lot of YA and NA books I could mention, all put together. This is probably my best Dr. Seuss book yet.                             22 book reviews: Dr. Seuss 's ability of conveying strong important messages in such simple prose is truly astonishing.  The book is listed in the Ages 5+ section of the 1001 Children 's Books to Read Before You Growup, but seeing so many American reviewers mentioning that they received received it as part of high school graduation shows the practical message of you being in charge of your own fate through choices can appeal to anyone.  Like all Seuss books the illustrations make up so much of the story. There 's certain paths to avoid and some bumps along the way, but with the right attitude and determination your almost guaranteed to succeed. (Well 98 and 3/4 percent guarantee!).  23 book reviews: This is a lovely book and quite different in many ways to much of Dr Seuss 's classic children 's books. For what is ostensibly a children 's book, is perhaps nothing of the kind - this is a book which is most definitely for all of us. This is a story about the journey of life, it 's about life 's challenges, the successes and the happiness, along with the loneliness and the sadness of life. The good and the bad along with the happy and the sad - as it were.  In the hands of so many other authors / illustrators this could have been merely trite and vapid nonsense, giving us supposedly motivational thoughts in that almost always clich d and stale way that we have all seen so many times before. But no - not with Dr Seuss; what we have here is something genuinely meaningful and thought-provoking, all presented in Dr Seuss 's usual style - with fun, with vigour and with so much life.  It is not surprising to learn that this book has become a common gift now at graduation events - whether they be at Primary or Secondary School or University. In addition the text from the book also now has a life as a wedding reception speech. None of which is at all surprising.  Dr Seuss gives us apparently simple thoughts and observations on the journey of life, set down in rhyme in a seemingly straightforward but profoundly wonderful way - accompanied by his usual lovely illustrations.  A classic Dr Seuss book and one definitely not to be missed.  24 book reviews: In honor of Dr. Seuss 's birthday on March 2, I read this book to my daughter for bedtime. It was her first time. It was my 5,208th time, and I still love it.  \"Oh, The Places You will Go\" is one of those books that everybody gets as a high school graduation present, but it 's a book that can be read and enjoyed at any time. It should be noted that this was the last book written and published by Dr. Seuss before his death, so the book 's message takes on a whole new meaning when put into that context.  Basically, this is a story about facing adversity, perseverence, out-of-box-thinking, and enjoying every moment of life. Good stuff regardless of politics or religious beliefs. Stuff you hope your children will read to their children one day.  25 book reviews: I have had this book on my dresser for a long time, siting there saying read me, but my brain saying, but it 's a kid book! Like, little, little kid book! Do not bother. So it sat there, in the waiting place. Just waiting. But in reality, I was in the waiting place. My god, I have been in the waiting place. What have I been doing all these years? Waiting! Just passing time. Not playing any games to win. Just waiting. How so sad. Not anymore. Who needs the gurus, preachers, god, etc, when you have this book. I got goosebumps reading this book. A little, little kid book has given me goosebumps. Pick your head up, kid, life 's a great balancing act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left. Oh, all the places you will shall now go.  26 book reviews: This book contains a very powerful inspirational message for children and adults alike. It contains great wisdom about the trials and tribulations of life with a powerful message of life. It contains a warning that we all need to heed: Except when you do not. Because sometimes you wo not' Something we all have to accept and deal with. Always at the basis is a very powerful message of hope : \"Kid , you will move mountains\". Unlike \"Solla Sollew\" , Dr Seuss acknowledges in this book that sometimes when all the options are unattractive we need to head right out of town. And how right he is. And as in all of Dr Seuss' remarkable books , it is filled with the most beautiful , dreamlike illustrations. A must read for every child and adult!  27 book reviews: I bought this for my youngest son who is graduating from high school in a few days.   You are off to Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting, So... get on your way!   The journey of the book is based on the journey of life, with some speed bumps along the way,        But it never stops inspiring.      And my personal favorite,    I hope he reads it. What a truly wonderful book!   28 book reviews: \"I am afraid that some times you will play lonely games too. Games you ca not win 'cause you will play against you.'  All alone! Whether you like it or not, Alone will be something you will be quite a lot.\"  29 book reviews: Funny, I would never read a Seuss book. I have been put under certain pressure at work (now being a librarian in an Roman and Anglo-Saxon city in the south of England, made entirely of cobbles, small cafes and tired little shops) to read outside my own circles of interest. On the one hand, my manager told me, all of our different tastes work well. I read a lot of classics and literary fiction, a bit of history and pop-science. J. reads children 's books. T. reads old Shakespearean theory texts and art history. S. reads anything that strikes him as interesting. P. reads thrillers, anything that will keep him turning the pages. E. barely gets time to read around raising a child, but she can read in English, Russian or German. The other E. reads fantasy. The other other E. reads science-fiction and graphic novels.  But we can all expand our scopes to cover all bases, our manager suggests. So, the other day, whilst doing what is called a 'cosmetic tidy', I read this Dr Seuss book and found it surprisingly sentimental and, well, wise. A. tells me most kids books are deeper than adult books. He said I will learn that soon.  ",
    " Peril": "book reviews: I have read this book cover to cover four or five times. I have picked it up and opened a random page to read on dozens of occasions. I reread the margin notes that I have written at various times.  What I love about this book is that it uses art to talk about life. Specifically, it uses art and fear to talk about how our choice to have courage or not drives the degree of light you will manifest in your own life. The writers explore the human need for acceptance, fear of failure, communication sensibilities between your work and yourself versus your work and the outside world.  In talking about other 's \"magic\" in their work the authors write: \"Their magic is theirs. Your do not lack it. You do not need it. It has nothing to do with you. Period.\"  Stop coveting other peoples talent, skills, lessons. Find your own magic. Risk it. Earn it.  Everything I read in this book could also apply to the art of relationship. The art of love. You could cross out the title word Art and write LOVE & Fear, and the same concepts apply. It 's specific to art,yet universal.  It 's an easy read, barely over a hundred pages. Carry it in your backpack, put it in your purse, or on the back of your toilet. Read it. Return to it. Make your life your art. It 's that simple and profound.  1 book reviews: If you are in need of some motivation and do not have time to read The Artist 's Way series (which, by the way, I also recommend), it 's perfect for you.  It addresses issues like perfectionism, creative blocks, and motivation.  Here are some of my favorite quotes from it:     In large measure becoming an artist consists of learning to accept yourself, which makes your work personal, and in following your own voice, which makes your work distinctive.   If ninety-eight percent of our medical students were no longer practicing medicine five years after graduation, there would be a Senate investigation, yet that proportion of art majors are routinely consigned to an early professional death.   What separates artists from ex-artists is that those who challenge their fears, continue; those who do not, quit.   Tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding.   The risk is fearsome: in making your real work you hand the audience the power to deny the understanding you seek; you hand them the power to say, \"you are not like us; you are weird; you are crazy.\"    If is like a super deluxe 64 ounce mocha with flavored syrup, whipped cream, and a dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg on top, is like a shot of espresso.  Both are like caffeine to energize your artistic career, and which you choose is really a matter of taste.  2 book reviews: It starts out strong, very strong, and then falls apart in a semantic entanglement of mixed metaphors and pseudo philosophy that spends a lot of words saying very little. It 's a bit frustrating to read, the section on art and science was a disaster, perhaps demonstrating the authors complete lack of understanding of science. The two authors refer to \"art\" in such a flimsy pretext that they not only fail to define it, they change the implied definition to suit whatever point is being made but then mix the definitions in chains of clumsy logic (sometimes to the fine art business, other times to any creative expression, other times to a limited set of work that is non-reproducible). They go further into neologic territory and leave the word \"art\" in an unusable state that lacks any coherent meaning.  For an artist, the book is captivating in parts, especially in the beginning as it concerns execution and vision, and a discussion of common fears in the art making process -- excellent insights. But that 's maybe a 1/5 of the book, the title is a bit misleading...  By the end of the book, you will likely be entirely confused and realize \"there 's no definition of art\", and it 's the artists (and art community 's) own fault. Tirelessly extolling \"what is\" and \"what is not\" art seems to have ruined the word in our vocabulary... if it 's going to become so subjective as to not have a communicable meaning, then... well it does not really mean anything.  Anyway, it 's a quick read and if you enjoy pseudo intellectual banter that lacks meaningful content then you might enjoy more of it than I   3 book reviews: I am an artist. This book is absolutely terrible.  In the first chapter, the authors claim that that art came before consciousness and that prehistoric cave painters were not conscious beings. When they painted a bison on the wall, they had no idea what they were doing or why they were doing it. They did not even know that they or the cave painting existed.  So how the hell do you unconsciously paint a bison? If the prehistoric artists lacked conscious intent to create the picture, what exactly would prompt them to paint? Just automatic reflexes? Some sort of cave-decorating instinct that forced these unconscious humans to paint on auto-pilot? I do not think so. Obviously, the cave artists knew the bison existed and that it was possible to create a likeness of the animal using pigments. If they did not, they would not do it.  The word \"creativity\" is not mentioned anywhere in the book, except in the tiny segment that points this out to the reader. \"Why should it?\" the authors ask smugly. \"Do only some people have ideas, confront problems, dream, live in the real world, and breathe air?\" Yeah, okay, everyone is creative - I get it. But not discussing creativity in a book about making art? What? That 's like writing a recipe book and saying \"this book does not mention ingredients. Why should it? Do only some desserts have flour, sugar, eggs, butter?\"  I have no clue why this book has such glowing reviews. The great majority of it is pretentious nonsense, obvious advice like \"do not worry about what other people think of your art!\", or just plain wrong information that the authors try to pass off as fact. I do not recommend it at all.  4 book reviews: This book is about the challenges in making, or not making, art. Making art is difficult. Many times artists will stop making art and then feel guilty about not returning. Why? The is what the author says-- \"Lack of confidence and self doubt -- I am not an artist-- I am a phony; other people are better than I am; I have never had a real exhibit; I am no good. Or maybe fear about what others say after looking at your work. Basically the only work really worth doing-- the only work you can do convincingly -- is the work that focuses on the things you care about. The individual recipe any artist finds for proceeding belongs to that artist alone-- it 's non-transferable and no of little use to others. In the end it all comes down to this: you have a choice between giving your work your best shot and risking that it will not make you happy, or not giving it you best shot-- and thereby GUARANTEEING that it will not make you happy. It becomes a choice between certainty and uncertainty. And curiously, uncertainty is the comforting choice.\"  5 book reviews: A quick, no-nonsense, part-philosophical-part-practical examination of what it means to make art, no matter the medium, and to continue to do so in spite of its inherent challenges. The authors' basic premise is that you can and will only ever be you, and all the other people in the world will also only ever be themselves. It might seem obvious, but the logical corollary here is that it is a pity to not make art because you are the only person who could ever make the art that you make. A second corollary is that it is useless to compare your art to that of other artists.  With that notion in mind, the authors explore different forms of fear that lead people to stop making art, and explain concisely why each one is silly, surmountable, and ultimately up to you to overcome. It 's a beautiful piece of quasi-self-help that offers only blunt and useful considerations without any of the fluff and hand-holding with which self-help, as a genre, is infested.  I loved this book. Its applications reach beyond the scope of art, and into any form of creative thought (whether in sciences, math, problem solving, etc), and should be read by absolutely everyone. I mean it. Everyone.  6 book reviews: 7 book reviews: This book was recommended to me and to all of my fellow art students by a professor, whose every word is normally golden. I must say this was the exception.  When this small pamphlet of a book was published in the early nineties, perhaps it answered an urgent need of recent art school grads and artists struggling to stay productive when faced with the loneliness of the process. It 's still true, outside of the nurturing environment of art academia, the level of disinterest in art, and the artist 's particular work, is a sobering blow to the artist 's sense of direction and self worth. All the tricks of convincing yourself to return to the studio and just churn out as much work as you can, inviting mistakes to happen - all that is still relevant. But its also advice easily gleaned from the art blogosphere, and reads as something akin to shallow pop psychology articles. It 's not quite as redundant as the ubiquitous advice lists, but still it is a matter of getting someone else to tell you something you already know. I was expecting something revelatory for a book to be worth my time, but got a no-nonsense \"stop fretting about this and that and just do your work\" pat on the back.  Which is fine. It is somewhat encouraging to have evidence that other artists have dealt with the very same setbacks, that the nature of the contemporary art world indeed cultivates unstable and broken-up sense of identity in most art-workers. But here are fears that are worth digging deeper. They merit a thorough treatise, not an advice column. Then again, I might just be the sort of person who enjoys 500-page books.  To be fair though, I am already finding myself repeating to myself some of the key sentences from the book, that were particularly on point. For people who prefer laconic presentation of ideas, this might be perfect.  8 book reviews: Depending upon where you may be in your particular process as an artist, \"Art and Fear\" can be a light in the dark for anyone desiring to take their work more seriously. Oftentimes, those who write, paint, sculpt or shoot fear discussing this topic with others, even other artists, at the risk of sounding pretentious or dull. To read this book, a slim, unassuming-looking little volume, is to feel freer in admitting: I am an artist, or writer. My work is important to me, even if it is unimportant to the rest of the world. It is important to my life and my peace of mind that I be productive. My work has a trajectory. Transcending this barrier often means the difference between shying away from the actual work and having the ability to sit down and, as one individual once eloquently put it, just do the fuckin thing. The book makes it clear that it is the product, and less the product, the artist 's original conception of the product or the audience 's review, which matters; hence, it is the process, sittin down and practicing, which matters most. As everyone who has ever written a paper realizes, the end result has most often made so many steps away from the original conception that it is more firmly rooted in the world for having been worked over and made real than in the writer 's mind. The book also grants some wonderful advice for that difficult process of dragging your work out of your private cave, the most happy place where work is done in private, and into the world, where it has a better chance of survival. Look also for the guidelines approaching the best methods by which artists can work, and be inspired, by other artists (living and dead) in a way which is healthy and proactive as opposed to threatening. My copy is dog-eared and well underlined, and will sit on the shelf until I need another reminder as to why I am broke and doing this with my life.  9 book reviews: I could really relate to the first third of this book and found it very motivating as an artist. After that, it got less and less interesting and more and more vague. My favorite quotes/sections from the first part:  pg 3 \"Even talent is rarely distinguishable, over the long run, from perseverance and hard work.\"  pg 5 \"The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your work that soars.\"  pg. 15 \"Imagination is in control whenyou begin making an object. The artwork 's potential is never higher than in that magic moment when the first brushstroke is applied, the first chord struck. But as the piece grows, technique and craft take over, and imagination becomes a less useful tool. a piece grows by becoming more specific...The development of an imagined piece into an actual piece is a progression of decreasing possibilities...\"  pg. 29 The ceramics class divided into two groups; half would be graded on quantity and the other half on quality. The half graded on quantity ended up making better work  pg. 30 \"...to require perfection is to invite paralysis\"  10 book reviews: Popular and familiar with my friends; it was my first read. Favorite passages:  \"Art is like beginning a sentence before you know its ending...tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding [at making art].\"  \"Talent...is 'what comes easily'... a gift\" yet the author reminds us that \"whatever you have is exactly what you need to produce your best work. There is probably no clearer waste of psychic energy than worrying about how much talent you have...Talent may get someone off the starting blocks faster, but without a sense of direction or a goal to strive for, it wo not count for much.\"  [My favorite quote] \"The only work really worth doing--the only work you do convincingly--is the work that focuses on the things you care about. TO not focus on those issues is to deny the constants in your life...TO make art is to sing with the human voice. To do this you must first learn that the only voice you need is the voice you already have...You have to see that the universe is not formless and dark throughout, but awaits simply the revealing light of your own mind.\"  11 book reviews: The short review: I will be sleeping with this book under my pillow from now on. I find the very sight of its cover inspiring and must resist clutching it to my breast at all times like a talisman. The long review: The authors write that the book is the result of years of discussions about what artists -- regardless of the type of art -- have in common, and they come up with some very real, practical, and spiritual (in the best way) suggestions. The authors address the question of not \"why do we make art?\" but \"why do we stop making art, why do we quit, how do we keep going?\". They do it with such careful intelligence, compassion, and understanding that I am letting them get away with other things like capitalizing the words Art and Vision every once in a while. (If you are not Emily Dickinson, you do not get to do this, as far as I am concerned.) I am also letting them get away with using the first-person plural (\"we\") and referring to themselves as \"the authors\", because they also clearly have a wry sense of humor and genuine honesty that deflates gestures towards pretention. This book is basically about the craft of making art -- not the craft of writing a good sentence or painting a picture or dancing a pirouette -- the craft of becoming yourself, confronting yourself, mundanely holding yourself to the task at hand. It is genius, and I am a little surprised it 's not required reading in MFA programs. I certainly could have used its wisdom before now.  12 book reviews: This little book is all about how you get over yourself, get out of your way and do what you gotta do. There are parts that that were relevant for me, and parts that were not, but overall one with wonderful insights, tips, and advice that would apply to everyone. 13 book reviews: First some words of introduction about why I read this book. Some people here on Goodreads know that I am using my retirement, which started several years earlier than is traditional, to concentrate on photography, a lifelong hobby that I have converted into a small business. And some of those some people know that, secretly, my passion is for abstract photography which I admire but struggle to create myself.  Recently, however, I have signed up to a course. Well, it s more like an on-line mentoring community led by my two favourite photographers, Valda Bailey and Doug Chinnery. Both of these two artists concentrate on Intentional Camera Movement and Multiple Exposures as a means of creating artistic and abstract images with a camera. This course comes in two parts. The first concentrates on technique and the second, more interesting to me, concentrates on helping people to find their  artistic voice .  As part of the community, there are a couple of  book clubs  running and this book is the first book we are discussing together.  I have to admit to mixed feelings about Art & Fear. I liked that it was attempting to encourage people, me, to make art despite the uncertainty involved. It recognises that creating art is different to other  jobs  in that, if you do it properly, you put yourself on display at the same time as your work. All this is good to know, but is perhaps somewhat self-evident. But the book is annoyingly full of aphorisms and a lot of them are rather banal. Take  When you act out of fear, your fears come true  as an example.  The book is supposed to be about what it means to make art in the real world. It explores how art gets made and what stops it being made.  I am not an expert on art books, but from my own limited reading, I would say that if you want to read a book about making art in the real world, you should read by Sara Baume.  I may come back and change my mind about this book after the discussion in my new  community . Watch this space.  14 book reviews: This book was written by two working artists in 1993 to address the anxieties and concerns common to late 20th century makers of creative output such as visual art, literature, music, and performance. The authors cite that many artistic fears originate in places outside of their imaginations and supportive art-making environments. Prevalent social and marketplace attitudes about the value of art, who has a right to produce it and who will be recognized, praised and paid to do it are difficult for many artists to ignore and not internalize. Family, friends, laborers, and  professionals  all seem to agree that what artists do IS NOT WORK. Meanwhile, the artist hopes to make a living doing her own work but finds it at odds with what the marketplace demands, leaving her insecure about pursuing her intuitive art-making processes.  Popular mythology casts artists as prolific geniuses made of eccentric tempers, emotional disorders, and more magical talent than everyone else. Such artists are often burdened with being expected to bear witness to all the world s social ills, speak truth to power, and deliver soul-mending solutions to problems of every ilk. Inundated with such forces, some artists become paralyzed or find other reasons to abandon making their work. I recommend this book for artists who are feeling discouraged and wondering why they ever began their lines of artistic inquiry. These  observations  have such a definitive-sounding quality I nearly forgot my sense of humor but I don t think that is a reflection on Bayles & Orland. It points to my own erroneous ideas that artists are supposed to be brooding,  deep,  profound, and only trifling with the most serious issues of the day. Looked at this way, there isn t much about an artist s life to be enjoyed; rather, it s just a dilemma-filled endurance test!  Hip-hop culture,  outsider  art, and  new media  forms are not examined by these authors, but I enjoyed this observation: For me the resonances and intimacy of the first half of the book were more engaging than the second part. I did a lot of underlining and bracketing and---oh look! a note to myself on one page reveals that I started reading this book back in 2008 but set it to the side for reasons unknown.  15 book reviews: Have never read anything better on what goes into making art, for an artist. The motivations, the distracting temptations--what constitutes the only possible reward to keep at it, to keep doing it. I am a 74 year old artist, and have gone through all the phases of despair, stopping, starting again. This book made me weep with joy. I do not know that I found much new here, new for me at this stage in my life and my art, but the confirmation for what I have struggled with over so many decades is like a blessed cool rain after a long drought.  16 book reviews: I soaked up the first half of this slim guide with frequent shouts of \"Yes! THIS!\" and skimmed the second half with a bit of a shrug and a *meh* Is not it odd when that happens? It 's really okay, though, since I found so very much solace, empathy, and inspiration in the parts I did absorb. Things like,  . . . Those who continue to make art are those who have learned how to continue or more precisely, have learned how not to quit.  This is a book about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially statistically speaking there aren t any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius.  Vision, Uncertainty, and Knowledge of Materials are inevitabilities that all artists must acknowledge and learn from: vision is always ahead of execution, knowledge of materials is your contact with reality, and uncertainty is a virtue.  Making art is dangerous and revealing. Making art precipitates self-doubt, stirring deep waters that lay between what you know you should be, and what you fear you might be. For many people, that alone is enough to prevent their ever getting started at all -- and for those who do, trouble is not long in coming. Doubts, in fact, soon rise in swarms:    Yet viewed objectively, these fears obviously have less to do with art than they do with the artist. And even less to do with the individual artworks. After all, in making art you bring your highest skills to bear upon the materials and ideas you most care about. Art is a high calling -- fears are coincidental.  Making art now means working in the face of uncertainty; it means living with doubt and contradiction, doing something no one much cares whether you do, and for which there may be neither audience nor reward.  Art is like beginning a sentence before you know its ending.  The truly special moments in art making lie in those moments when concept is converted to reality.    Good stuff.  17 book reviews: What the title says, but much more engaging than you would expect from the title. 18 book reviews: I found Art and Fear to be the right book for the right time. I am a fairly successful and prolific playwright, but over the last year I have been struggling with severe writer 's block. I have unable to even muster up the courage to look at a blank page or screen. The paralysis has affected my confidence and belief not only in my own abilities but also in the field I work in. What this book has shown me is that this lull is simply part of the process and I have to learn to interpret the fears I am dealing with in terms of my own growth as an artist and as a human being. There are many quotable pearls in this book, but without context, they seem rather obvious. The authors are really just trying to remind us of those things we already know, but have forgotten as we have matured in our art-making.  The book 's not for everybody. It 's certainly not for the lay person who may want to pick up this book up in order to tap into their creativity. It wo not make sense to them, and in fact, it may piss them off. The authors refuse to romanticize the artistic process and insist on making us confront some of the contemporary cultural and economic challenges that artists face today. No, \"Art and Fear\" is for the working artist (by which I mean, the painter, the writer, the director, the dancer, the composer, etc.) engaged in serious inquiry who has lost his/her way. It 's for people like me who are blocked and/or questioning their pursuit in this enterprise called Art.  It 's not written by psychologists, so there are none of the familiar catch-words or prescriptive solutions for our malaise. It 's penned by a pair of working artists who have also fallen into the same hole that we all end up in one time or another. In that sense, it 's a survival manual, a kind of lifeline. But it 's beautifully and elegantly written, too, condensing some of the hardest issues we deal with into real-world artists' questions. For that reason alone, it 's a book I will keep on my shelf for as long as I write, because I know I will come to this point again.  As for this writer 's block, I am letting it have its way, for now. I know I will come back to my work in time, but as a changed man with new marching orders.  19 book reviews: This book was assigned to me for my Drawing class.  Some of the concepts are useful, and there were some very good points made. However, it felt as if the authors were trying to stretch a five-page essay into a book; it was redundant and, after the first chapter, waffling.  It also seemed as though the book was aimed specifically towards artists looking to showcase their pieces in galleries, which is not necessarily a failing of the book so much as a narrow target demographic.  On a more personal level, I was rather frustrated that only one female artist was mentioned amongst the some twenty or twenty-five artists referenced. When the authors mentioned Watson and Crick, he failed to mention Franklin, and while that would have been a forgivable omission in 1993, the copy I had was a 2010 edition, and that should have been rectified. It might be a minor nitpick, but it 's an example of a pattern of exclusion.  There really was not any excuse not to reference more women. There are so many wonderful, talented, brave artists out there who would have made for better material than \"a friend of the authors\".  It seemed like the book was aimed at male artists looking to have galleries. It 's not something I would recommend to female artists, and certainly not to artists pursuing other careers.  Really, very disappointing.  20 book reviews: Read this one for my creative writing in the genres class. I feel truly bad for these guys because they just wrote the most useless book of all time. There was a lot of meaningless content in here about being an artist. What was the point of it all? They wrote:  Books on art, even books on artists, characteristically have little to say about actually MAKING art.  And then had the audacity to write this book.  Some of it was good, and it contained wisdom from other artists, but those few and far between quotes weren t good enough. This book was far more philosophy than I was prepared to handle. I m also just well aware at this point that being an artist means being afraid all the time and just getting over it. I feel like this book did nothing to address the overwhelming dread of being an artist, just kept saying that this life sucks. Bruh you don t have to tell us that. Where s the hope?! When it wasn t about nothing, it was abysmal.  (G rating)  21 book reviews: Inspirational. I like stories that are balm to my artistic lateblooming. Calms the inner turmoil of yet another month, year, without publication. It makes the drawersful of scribbled foolscap, of slapdash characterization, of hours of unpresentable efforts a little less of a tell-tale heart. It makes things okay to know that the Mozarts are one every couple hundred years, yet great art gets made all the time. Just work at it. It is a helpful, boost of a book in the vein of Pressfield 's creativity books designed to look at things pragmatically, ease the pressure, and work. I will be returning to it frequently.  22 book reviews: um livro sobre fazer arte que n o menciona em nenhum momento a palavra CRIATIVIDADE. o que obviamente conta como ponto positivo. tamb m um livro que se faz dif cil pelo que ele tem de melhor: evoca distra es. voc  se mete a pensar em ideias e possibilidades, e de repente passou uma p gina inteira e voc  j  n o lembra o que leu (estava lendo?). recomendo. 23 book reviews: THIS BOOK IS SO AWESOME I WANT TO TATTOO IT ON MY BODY!  I am a relatively small person, but \"Art and Fear\" is not a long book either, so... 24 book reviews: Platitudinous, hackneyed, jumbled. Some good ideas but not a cohesive or engaging book. 25 book reviews:           26 book reviews: I just was not impressed by this book.  Part of the problem may have been the sheer volume of recommendations I got for this little guy and to live up to those expectations it would basically have to cure cancer, so take that for what it is.  First of all, there were a couple of gold nuggets in the book. I rather liked the anecdote of an artist who took dancing for fun, excelled, then had to relearn how to dance for others when the chance arose for her to be part of a performance troop. It was just interesting that she had to relearn a skill she already had with a different motivation.  Unfortunately, other parts were very trite at times and did not make a lot of sense at others. I think someone else mentioned that when discussing cave paintings, the authors said something like the cavemen were not intelligent enough to be self-aware which struck me as blatantly false.  As is common, it 's loaded with adages about how art is made by people who make art, not people who stop and how hard work is hard to distinguish from talent, and that most artists feel like frauds, but none of that struck me as anything special. I have heard that many times before. Perhaps is it was new information in the early nineties, but now it 's so readily available, it just seems like a giant yawn.  Finally I was really put off by the author 's text in boxes. Basically from time to time, they would have a small aside to \"explain\" something, but it really seemed more like snarking than anything else. For example:  Q: Are not you ignoring the face that people differ radically in their abilities? A: No. Q: [...If each person made their best work, would not] the more gifted make better work, and the less gifted, less? A: Yes. And would not that be a nice planet to live on?  That 's not addressing the issue!  I was also rather perturbed by the authors' description of entertainment as mass produced, clearly meant derisively. They barely reference commercial art and then rag on how there are very few paying opportunities for artists. It seems like they are missing something there.  Finally I did not like their section on schooling. There is a lot of merit to learning how to draw the figure if nothing else, but they never address that school might give you the tools to address technical matters. Again, this may have been relevant at the time of publishing, but I can tell you that there are schools that prepare you for commerical arts for sure.  So basically, it had a few gold nuggets that got it a second star, but it really was not a great read. It had the virtue of at least being super short.  27 book reviews:  The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of artwork that soars. One of the basic and difficult lessons every artist must learn is that even the failed pieces are essential The point is that you learn how to make your work by making your work, and a great many of the pieces you make along the way will never stand out as finished art.    Fears about artmaking fall into two families: fears about yourself, and fears about your reception by others. In a general way, fears about yourself prevent you from doing your best work, while fears about your reception by others prevent you from doing your own work.    Talent may get someone off the starting blocks faster, but without a sense of direction or a goal to strive for, it won t count for much. The world is filled with people who were given great natural gifts, sometimes conspicuously flashy gifts, yet never produce anything. And when that happens, the world soon ceases to care whether they are talented.    Even at best talent remains a constant, and those who rely upon that gift alone, without developing further, peak quickly and soon fade to obscurity. . . Artists get better by sharpening their skills or by acquiring new ones; they get better by learning to work, and by learning from their work.    The important point here is not that you have   or don t have   what other artists have, but rather that it doesn t matter. Whatever they have is something needed to do their work   it wouldn t help you in your work even if you had it. Their magic is theirs. You don t lack it. You don t need it. It has nothing to do with you. Period.    The hardest part of artmaking is living your life in such a way that your work gets done, over and over   and that means, among other things, finding a host of practices that are just plain useful.   28 book reviews: This book reminded my of Julia Cameron 's The Artist 's Way, but without all the parts that totally pissed me off like typos, the expression of stupid ideas about artists (although in fairness she was pointing out the stupidness) and lame exercises.  This is about why we fear creativity and by understanding our fears, we can conquer them, as we all know.  I do not have a lot of fear about making art but many of the fears described in this book, such as pleasing others, being accepted and/or understood, being perfect and so on apply to other areas of my life and probably to everyone on the globe.  This book is to the point and intelligent. I liked it.  29 book reviews: A short, surprisingly encouraging novel for artists of all sorts. It can apply to writing, painting, drawing, graphic design, music, etc. Highly recommended for anyone struggling with doubt in their artwork. In the inspiring words of Shia; ",

    " Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!": "book reviews: I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting \"This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!\" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book.  Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages:  * When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses.  * Try to own things that put money in your pocket.  * If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money.  There you go. That 's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics.  Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she has not been \"discovered\" yet. He tells her to take courses in marketing, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to market them.  I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I would feel for responding to a \"get rich quick\" spam mail.  1 book reviews: This book may do a good job of getting you excited about your financial future but the false information it teaches negates any benefits.  I believe this book does a disservice to the public. I suspect it was written to appeal to those who are failing in the world 's conventional definition of success. Did not go to college? Ca not hold down a stable job? Good for you! You have not fallen for that waste of time and stupid rat race like all those other suckers!  Saying that higher education is not worthwhile is misleading. I agree it is not essential (and possibly not even helpful in rare circumstances), but the high correlation in the general public between education and wealth cannot be ignored.  He also gives poor advice in finances and investing. For example, not adhering to diversification. Or getting out of a stable job (a.k.a. \"rat race\") where \"even if you win you are still a rat.\"  The author praises learning correct accounting but then proceeds to butcher even the most fundamentals. For example, his first rule is \"You must know the difference between an asset and a liability\" but then he proceeds to claim that your home is a liability, not an asset. Completely backwards. Any accountant will tell you so.  The book is full of exaggerated and sometimes completely false anecdotes -- for example, it appears the entire premise of the book is false -- there never was a rich dad and Robert was not wealthy until he embraced MLM and started selling get-rich books.  If you just want some motivation, please try another book such as \".\" If you want sound personal financial advice, please read \"The Only Investment Guide You will Ever Need.\"  See for an in-depth critique of Kiyosaki and charts showing the correlation between education and wealth.  2 book reviews: This book is not just about money. It 's about how we are taught to think; how we are programmed by schools, family, and friends to look at the rich as greedy no good bloodsuckers and opportunities as risks. It is an attempt to reprogram minds to look at why we do what we do.. why do we buy all these shoes, clothes, cars, jewelry.. have we earned it or are we just trying to maintain an image?  To me the most important thing it teaches is that being educated is the key.. educated in our motives, in money, in the world around us.. educated does not always mean a degree lessons can be learned anywhere at anytime..  The book is great for people like me who think in pictures and in theory. He explains his financial theories clearly and adds diagrams to explain how money flows into and out of our wallets. I have read other financial self-help books and they were too detailed, too \"do this...do that...\" For me that did not help or motivate me because, I do not do anything unless I want to do it. Other books never really gave me the why. They told me what I needed to correct.. but if I do not see anything wrong in what I am doing.. why should I take steps to correct it? This book broke down to me the whys. And now I am ready for action.  3 book reviews: This book has a picture of the author on the cover. I should ve considered myself warned. But here s the thing - I m 28 years old, married with no kids, spent the better part of the last 10 years at uni and I work full time. I have spent my entire life studiously avoiding economics, finance, accounting and all associated disciplines, instead always choosing the history/politics/social sciences path, and then studying law. As a result, I have a big gaping hole in my knowledge, and no idea about what to do with the money that I m currently saving. Also, I have this thing where I through phases of obsessively reading and learning about new things. A few months ago, it was fish and aquariums (I m not kidding). Now, it s learning about.. finance. I actually can t believe I m writing this, but .. I am.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book that both taught me some things, and made my blood boil. It borders on negligent in many areas, and is downright offensive in the guise of being  helpful . I absolutely agree with one of the premises, that many people are financially illiterate. I also agree that many people aren t able to teach their kids money stuff, because they don t know that much themselves. This book made me think about what I m doing with my money and gave me some insight into the kind of things I am now going to look into and research. But it also scared me. This book is a libertarian s wet dream that was written to be a bestseller. He won, I guess.  It s terribly written   it really is abysmal. This book bats you over the head with a few ideas (one of which is that The Poor should just stop being so poor!) through numerous  conversations  with his Rich Dad (who is supposedly the father of his friend). It s horrendous dialogue; it actually.. I just can t. It s horrible. It talks about his father (the Poor Dad) who is university educated and hard working, but supposedly foolishly believes that getting an education and then a secure job is a waste of time. Education   what a joke, right? What a waste of time and money, that could otherwise be spent on high risk ventures that will always make you millions. That can be further invested to make billions. Rich Dad, however, never finished high school, and owns numerous companies that employ The Poor (read: stupid idiots) who work for him, because they re The Poor. Rich Dad teaches us how The Rich do things, and why that s all we need to do to join their ranks.  The thing is, not everybody is afforded the same opportunities, and the point about high risk, is that risks are high. Sometimes it all comes crashing down. The world is not comprised of  the rich ,  the middle class  and  the poor  and even if you look at it that way, it is a dangerous (and derogatory) to consider that people are poor because they don t make their money work for them. Because they re  losers  (I shit you not) who are too scared to take a risk.  It is fervently anti-intellectual. It totally disregards that not everybody has the capacity or opportunity to  pay themselves first  before paying bills, or quit their job to make money work for them. Money doesn t just come to you if you try hard enough. Sometimes you need to actually pay your bills because there are real life consequences to failing to do so. Like, your utilities being disconnected. Your credit rating being destroyed.  In my view, and in reality, not everybody can be an employer. Employers need employees. There is actual intrinsic value to things other than being an employer, running a company, and making money. Things like, helping people, making things, research, writing, hell   even working. I find it scary, that people would pick this book up, be motivated by it (because if nothing else, it s motivating. Because everyone can be The Rich!) and be lulled into a false sense of entitlement, purpose and safety by its messages. I imagine that in person, Kiyosaki is a cult leader type person.  As I mentioned, I m not well versed in financial or economic things   but I can smell bullshit and see when inconvenient facts or complications are glossed over. This one is getting filed in the bin, and I m going to continue my learning elsewhere!  4 book reviews:       ..               ..                                                 ..       \"       !\"                       ..    ..                                 ..                    ..                  ..           ..                       ..                   ..    ..                                  ..     ..                  ..           ..             ..        ..                   ..           ..            ..             ..                                     ..     ..    ..!    ..             ..      ..               ..               ..                     ..            ..         ..       ..                       ..                           ...!      ..             ..      ..             \"       -       ..!\"      ..                       ..             ..      ..                     ..           ...     \"     \"       ...   ..    ..             ..             ..        ..                   ..                               ..      ..                       ..!    ..           ..         ..                             ..            ...         ..  5 book reviews: I read this book while in an Entrepreneur phase. On one hand, it is rather inspiring, in a John Madden sort of way. You see, John Madden (American football broadcaster) always makes everything sound easy, which may be how he coached the Raiders to the superbowl. He will say something like \"now what they need to do here is score a touchdown. I think that if they can do that, they will turn this game around\".  I still recall a memorable game where a quarterback 's contact fell out, and while he and the refs looked for it, Madden said \"now here 's a guy who when he wears glasses, he can see better\". When it 's explained in such a simple way, it really seems like the easiest thing in the world. Unfortunately, one must remember that the 6'5 defensive line is not just going to roll over and say 'uncle'.  Real estate is not any easier. There 's always some conflict around the corner to trip you up and send you back to square one (or often, square negative one). So, while this book gives you such excellent advice as \"learn from failure\", \"make profitable deals\", and \"work hard for yourself\", it does not actually give you a system or method to make money.  This seems a strange irony to me, as this book is clearly marketed to people who are not smart enough to realize that they should 'work hard and not give up' if they want to succeed, but who are smart enough to be able to figure all the rest of the logistics out by themselves.  Now, there are supplementary books that give a lot more in-depth information, but they still tend to fall into similar traps. It seems to me that you are either the self-motivated entrepreneur-type, or you are not, and that difference will show itself often and early in life. The self-made may use this book, but to continue projects they are already working on, not to start their  wouldream business' from scratch.  There is another option for the marketability of this book, but it is not one I like to think about: depressed people who feel their lives going nowhere trying to stave off depression by clinging to untenable dreams. For these types, self-help and new age books act like a surrogate (or additional) religion: bolstering their self-esteem and making them feel as if their dreams are truly within reach.  Then, years go by and the dream draws no nearer. They get depressed. So they whip out this book (or another one like it) and suddenly feel like their millionaire retirement is only 6 months away! This makes them feel self-satisfied and complacent, so they end up doing nothing until suddenly, months later, they realize they are no closer to their goal. I am not saying people should not have dreams, and I am definitely not saying not to follow them, and I know people get attached to their denial, but it 's not going to make your life any better.  More than anything, this book is a symptom of the cult of the real estate bubble, for whom property was never a bad investment: it would never go down and rates would always get more and more favorable. To say that their view was naively rosy would be kind.  One day, so the story goes, Joseph P. Kennedy was getting a shoe shine when the shine boy started talking about what stocks were good to invest in. This is what we call  amarket saturation'--when one area of business becomes popular, and suddenly, it seems like everyone is joining in. Kennedy got out before the crash of '29, and an intelligent investor, seeing how many books and reality shows there were about flipping houses, should have seen the real estate crash coming.  Unfortunately, the fiscal prophets of the self-help section were unable to predict the coming apocalypse--so it 's lucky for them that their money was tied up in book sales and speaking engagements rather than in the real estate deals they were pushing on others. I would like to think that these sales would drop off after the  amiracle of real estate' turned out to be another hollow investment bubble, but in these dire times, people are even more desperate to find the path to economic stability.  Now, I know that most people who (do not say 'peddle', do not say 'peddle') market these self-help (or new age) products are not usually scam artists. Most of them believe in what they do; they believe that they are helping people; and I hope sometimes they do.  However, there is a difference between being a doctor and telling someone they have cancer to help them move on, and lying that there is no cancer because it seems more 'kind' or 'uplifting'. The latter, is, of course, morally reprehensible (said the atheist).  Kiyosaki has built an empire off of this book, and made himself a pretty penny. He has also been investigated by some critics who have challenged his assertions about his wealth, real estate successes, and the very premise of the book. There is no evidence that his 'rich dad' ever actually existed, and Kiyosaki has said in interviews that the character is, at best, a combination of people. However, at other times he has stated that he definitely does exist. And that does not even go into his support of con artist Casey Serin.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe you will buy this book and it will turn your life around, maybe Kiyosaki is relating a true story of struggle and inspiration--but maybe not, maybe it will just be another $5 in his pocket and less room on your bookshelf for real economic and legal texts.  6 book reviews: Rich Dad , Poor Dad (Rich Dad #1), Robert T. Kiyosaki, Sharon L. Lechter  Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter.  It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one 's financial intelligence (financial IQ) to improve one 's business and financial aptitude.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki 's life.       :        2011    :            :              :            1385   270   9646617751           1386       1387           1388   9789646617759       1389       1392       1393                      -   21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            19/09/1399    09/08/1400     .    7 book reviews: Wow, what ideologically driven, poorly written, paternalistic rubbish! Reading this book reminds me of every conversation I ve ever had with a middle-aged, white guy, whose sense of entitlement and self-importance has reached such a critical level that as they lecture you on the reality of life, as they see it, while doing so by telling ridiculous, unrealistic parables that border on the nonsensical  In Kiyosaki s mind, the poor are that way because they are lazy, and spend money in the wrong way. The poor should take their paychecks, and buy some property(!) just like Kiyosaki did (although, he admits, what made him wealthy may not work for most). He also admits that McDonalds is the most popular fast food joint not because they sell a superior product, but because they have a superior business model. The lesson to be taken from this, I guess, is that business is not there to provide a better product than their competitor (seemingly against his libertarian-best widget mythology), but rather, to simply run a business. This is the most refreshing and realistic part of the book; capitalism doesn t care about the product it produces, it s a business for the sake of being a business. Finally, some realism is injected into the fantasy. But it doesn t really bode that well for the idea that competition in a capitalistic economy is based on businesses attempts to produce a better product than other businesses. In fact, it doesn t seem to be about the product at all!  Kiyosaki fails to acknowledge of the role privilege plays in this libertarian game. Although, he does admit that the wealthy  groom  their children for a wealthy lifestyle, anyone with even a small sense of honesty would realize that wealth is easy to create when it is handed to you by mommy and daddy. Kiyosaki s  rich dad  is the one that taught him all these lessons. Kiyosaki s  poor dad  is a highly educated PhD. I m willing to bet Kiyosaki has no idea what it is like to be poor. Kiyosaki lucked into wealth (in large part due to authoring a very badly written a book with a coauthor that sued him) and then going around the world and lecturing people about how if you re not wealthy, its your fault, and if you are, don t worry about the poor, it s their fault.  The  history  (of taxes, socialism, capitalism, et. al.) section of the book is laughable in its ideological assumptions and inaccuracy. But I will spare you. The main point of Kiyosaki s viewpoint, that everyone can be wealthy, is logically inconsistent. Not everyone can be wealthy, because, who would make the wealth? There would be no workers for the wealthy to exploit to increase their own wealth, while patting themselves on the back for what a good rich person they are. This type of faulty logic and inability to accurately comprehend reality should give anyone pause. Especially if this is the type of person you are taking financial advice from.  It is no surprise this clown s hero is Donald Trump. How many bankruptcies has that guy had? It is also no surprise that a regrettably significant number of Goodreads reviews (no fear, they wouldn t have read this far into my review) claim this is the first book they could ever read all the way through. Seriously?  Here is a good review about this fraud himself...  8 book reviews: I have been wanting to read this for a couple of years. After some recent events in my life I wanted to understand the financial thinking of people who were raised wealthy and those who were not. The first chapter was great. The storytelling was simple and informative. It made so much sense to me and I related to it. Then I started Lesson Two: Why Teach Financial Literacy. It was this chapter that I realized that homeboy Kiyosaki is quite pompous. I understand that he was using specific examples in his financial success which is essential for writing a book in this genre but he was just being pretentious and inflated.  It was a line in chapter six that made me halt and decide to put down the book for good. It was an example of how his friend bought a rundown house. Kiyosaki writes \"It was spooky to look at.\" What? did this supposedly financially intelligent man just say, \"It was spooky to look at\"? He did. He 's not worth my time.  I checked out this book at the library. If I would have bought this book I would have made him $16.95 richer and me $16.95 poorer. He does know how to invent money by creating a need. The need is for people to buy his books and products.  Kiyosaki 's lectures and advice may appeal to some but I felt like I was being swindled. I wo not finish this book and will read financial advice from people who are intelligently wealthy, more humbled and less pompous.  9 book reviews: \"Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule.\"  Simple, blunt, and sprinkled with a bit of controversy (according to some), Rich Dad Poor Dad is an important wake up call for all of us...  Review to come.   10 book reviews: Sorry, but this book is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo BS.  The concepts in this book, to me, are common sense and there are no concrete applications to his ideas. Yes, the poor get poorer while the rich get richer, there 's a ground-breaking idea! Yes, most people do not know how to manage their money, we know, so how about telling us how?  The majority of the book is Kiyosaki wanking it, telling us stories about his life (which I do not even think are true).  If you want to learn about personal finance and investment strategies, this is not the book for you.  11 book reviews:                                                     ,                                           ,                                                                                     ,                                                                                                           ,     ,                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                   ,                                         ,                   ...                                                                                         ...  12 book reviews: The signal to noise ratio is not very good in this book. But there are already many useful critical reviews on GR, so, I will just talk about the important takeaways.  It 's a generic self-help book which talks of \"what\" one should do (/not do) and not \"how\". If one is looking for practical advices related to investing, this is not an apt book to pick up.  Important takeaways : 1) Be financially literate. This makes the majority of the content of the book.     2) Have total financial self-reliance vs reliance on managers for investment advices. 3) Buy income generating assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate). Keep liabilities and expenses down. After asset base is good, make speculative investments (big and risky). Investment is not risky, the lack of financial intelligence is. Buy luxuries last. Always ask do I really need to buy this. 4) Learn business systems, sales and marketing skills, become better at communicating, negotiating, handling fear of rejection, fear of losing money and overcoming cynicism. 5)  There is also a short biography of Robert Kiyosaki who definitely had an adventurous childhood. He became part of some small businesses at an early age of 9 and was quite imaginative in identifying opportunities to make money.   I do think that for a generation which grew up with internet and browsing Quora or Medium, most of the content in the book is common knowledge. Also it 's a self-help and not an actual investing book. But it 's a short and simple read and okay to read for a beginner.  Also note that almost all the time when the author uses \"poor\", he is referring to the middle class and not actual poor who do not have access to basic opportunities.   13 book reviews: Read this one in 2004, but maybe I read an earlier edition...  I think I rated this one 5stars. I have to review my journals, it 's been too long, I ca not remember what I have written.  I will be back with this one...   14 book reviews: This is a GREAT book! I can definitely say it changed my life and they way I look at money and finances. For example, my husband and I bought investment properties after I had him read it as well. It is very easy and interesting to read. READ IT! READ IT! READ IT!  Here is one of my favorite lines from it, approximately quoted: \"I have never met a rich man who has not lost a lot of money, but I have met a lot of poor men who have never lost a dime.\" True! SO TRUE. Everytime I lose money in an investment, I remember how much better I am for investing and making my money work for me than just hiding it and hoping nothing bad happens to it.  Also, I loved the story of the young talented writer who came to Robert Kiyosaki and lamented not being able to get published. He told her she was very talented, and that she should take a sales class. She was mortified. SALES? She was a gifted writer, not a lowly salesperson. (I excelled at sales, so I personally already was thinking she was kind of dumb.) Robert Kiyosaki pointed out that the cover if his book said \"Best SELLING author\", not \"Best WRITING author\". She was miffed. He was right.  I saw some other reviews saying they disliked the way he talks about people with tons of education always being poor, as if he is above them and so much smarter. Honestly, there is nothing wrong with having lots of education and still being poor, if that 's all you want. This book is about how to be smart financially, though. Feel free to be poor. I want to be a millionaire soon. So I learn about money. And I love and learn from Robert Kiyosaki, who is great at that.  Lots of people look at him and get annoyed that he is so rich and successful, and do not like him. I instead look at how he is rich and successful, and try to figure out how he did it. Amen.  15 book reviews:                          ...                      ...                                                                                             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ :          :                  .                            .                                                                            ...               ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ :                                                         .                                          : 1 -   2-   3-   4-     5-   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                :                                        ...                                                                                  ...                ...                                                                                          ...                            ...                                                            16 book reviews: Probably the stupidest and most over-hyped book I have ever touched. Rhetorical and Biased. Opinions without any facts.  Kiyosaki tries to convince you that poor are poor because they make bad decisions, or because they just want to remain poor; totally oblivious to the fact that it 's a result of oppression and domination in most places. You ca not just separate economics from politics and then draw conclusions. See Rutger Bregman 's to understand the actual psychology of poverty.  17 book reviews: This book goes on my shelf of four books I read over and over, books I read devotionally. It totally revolutionized my outlook not only on making money, but also on education. I wish everyone would read this. I wish the close-minded, those who graduated from whatever school they attended and have not allowed themselves a new thought since, could break through the stone walls they have erected around their souls and let this in. This message can save our world! I am not exaggerating.  (May 24, 2016) I just finished re-re-re-reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad. From the first chapter it was like watching a fireworks show. The insights! Admittedly, I love seeing things in a new way, and I love having a different take on things. What Kiyosaki has to say on education should be broadcast, read, and studied, and all education systems in the world should take him into account. If a lot more people would read and take to heart his financial advice, I think the world 's economy would be much better. Now I have to go out and live this. And I am starting the book over tomorrow.  18 book reviews: Mr.Kiyosaki could use a little humility. The pompousness in his tone is a bit off-putting. Also, the repeated emphasis on some of his financial \"gems\" gets tiring. Other than that, this was a decent read. 19 book reviews: While driving for the Thanksgiving vacation, my husband and I listened to Robert Kiyosaki s book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, on CD. This book helped us to expand and to think outside the box when it came to money. It gave us many things to think about and other ways to view our finances. I enjoyed it so much that I not only listened to it twice on CD, but also read the book itself.  In his book, Kiyosaki reveals that he had two fatherly perspectives while growing up. His biological father maintained an attitude towards money that kept him struggling financially throughout his life. His friend s father, who he spent a lot of time with, held a different perspective, and ultimately prospered. The two men regarded money differently, which caused young Robert to compare and ponder the different things each dad taught. In doing so, he had to choose which path to follow, rather than just blindly accept what he learned. He applied these principles in his life, and, like his rich dad, prospered financially.  I enjoyed the way Kiyosaki introduced us to both fathers. He puts us in the scene of action, rather than lecturing us, and like he did as a boy, we learn from actions rather than words. This is more successful, I think, than most financial books, which while helpful can be a little boring.  Kiyosaki presents the six lessons that his rich dad taught him, and then expands on them. He provides examples and applications. Much of what he says caused me to change my normal perspective as I considered a different way of thinking. Similarly, as I read, I could see phrases that I and others have used that mark us as  poor.  In fact, over the Thanksgiving holiday, my dad unknowingly repeated about six or seven things that Kiyosaki s  poor dad  had said! These statements have caused me to realign many of my thoughts on money.  As we drove, my husband and I frequently stopped the CD to discuss not only the changes in our thinking but also the inspiration that occurred to us. We began seeking opportunities, rather than just blindly accepting the fact that we were broke. We discussed business opportunities, and chances we could  work to earn  rather than  work for money.   If this book has a failing, it is that it is more of an overview than a how-to. It left me wanting to learn more. However, I understand that Kiyosaki has several other books written that appear to dive into the subject more thoroughly, and I look forward to reading those. Still, this works as a great stepping-off point to make us reconsider our view of financial issues.  This was clear, well-written, and thought-provoking, and left me wanting to learn more. It made for great discussion with my husband, and I felt like we both grew closer as we considered the opportunities around us. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to increase their financial knowledge.  20 book reviews:                                                                                              :                                                                                                     .                                                                         .                                                               .                                 ...                                                                                                                    .  21 book reviews: Fun fact, this book caught my attention because the title looked gay.  I kept reading despite this because I have officially started MBA courses and I recognize that if I wo not find something to love in Business, I will not be able to complete this degree, let alone succeed. That is a shame because people 's amazed faces when I share my degrees is such an ego boost (which I desperately need cause cheers for crippling imposter syndrome).  In short chapters, Kiyosaki shares the financial education he received from \"rich dad\", the father of one of his friends. He compares it to the financial advice his own father gave him. The argument is that most people stay unhappy with their financial situation because they do not own any assets and they end up working for others, rather than for themselves. While his own father encourages him to seek an education and a stable job, his rich father helps him become financially educated.  The book is written in a very accessible way. It 's clear that his target audience is frustrated people who lack knowledge and he definitely manages to make his messages come across. However repetitive, this book is short and easy.  I fear this is the end of positive things I can say on this book. As others have pointed out, Kiyosaki recognizes the importance of professionals and educated people and yet, consistently bashes them. Much of this book is filled with condescending and rude rhetoric towards intellectuals and the working class.  Here 's the thing. Labor is necessary. With this in mind, not everyone will be able to apply these lessons because ultimately, in our current age, you are still going to need someone down the line doing the actual labor. Jeff Bezos can get richer with his assets but his entire company rests on the people working in delivery and packaging. So really, Kiyosaki 's condescension makes little sense. His own company requires lawyers, accountants, etc, who are all educated people. Without workers, both educated and not, Kiyosaki 's \"financial education\" means nothing. He can say these people are in the \"rat race\", that they are forever working for someone else but what he proposes seems to be \"let 's gain wealth on the backs of others!\".  Really, I hesitate to stand behind the \"eat the rich\" crowd but damn, studying business is making me an actual communist.  In fact, I found myself grateful that I am studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics before approaching Business. At least Economics has the dignity to pretend that it 's for the benefit of others, that the market benefits from greed. Business seems to be a field for people who simply want to be rich and powerful without caring about the societal impact of their behavior (whoops, is this the right attitude to succeed in my MBA?).  Now, up until the fifth chapter, I was able to excuse this book as greed inducing and that 's it. However, in the fifth chapter, Kiyosaki gets into taxes. He rightfully points out that rich people do not pay taxes so that the weight of taxes fall on the shoulders of the middle class. At this point, I had hoped Kiyosaki was ready to look at the social impact of his ideas.  Obviously not. Instead, Kiyosaki claims that this will always be the case because the rich are able to evade taxes. This is a confusion of normative and descriptive. It is true that the rich do not pay taxes however, is this what we ideally want? Somehow, Kiyosaki seems to feel that since the rich do tax evasion, we should all strive to be like the rich and evade tax. Does not it make more sense for the government to force the rich to pay the taxes?  Kiyosaki seems to suggest that it 's inevitable that the rich will find loopholes. However, when corporations have such an impact on politics in the US (for example, if you still have some faith in the American democracy,), it should come as surprise to no one that they evade tax. This means that the group who is screwing people over is the rich (*coughs* rich dad is a thief), and not the government, unlike how Kiyosaki wishes to present it.  Then, he talks about healthcare and old age care. Again, he portrays some of the challenges the middle class faces yet he pretty much lost the last bits of my respect when he referred to American healthcare as \"socialized\". My dude, have you looked at other developed democracies?  Really, the American centric nature of this book was too much for me. Like, come on, your defunct welfare state is not something to be proud of. There are other forms of capitalism which are not socialism and do include social benefits. There are other ways to build an economy.  Things do not improve from here. The book ends with more ego-stroking. To conclude, yes, financial education matters but part of financial education should be some form of social thinking. Basically, Economics and Business ca not be studied alone, this is a recipe to creating selfish villains, poor dad was right all along.   - Do not even get me started on his comments on unions. - I just have so much disdain for business. For example, in my reading today, the textbook cheerfully pointed out that some airlines have \"informal job descriptions\" where workers \"pitch in!\". The flight attendants also help clean the plane and the pilots also load luggage so the company is very cost efficient. Or in other words, the airline essentially robs workers fair payment from the labor they do. This should not be applauded. Frankly, this should be illegal, what the heck does an informal job description mean? #Elizabeth_Anderson_is_right - Well, time to continue my finance homework.

It s one of the best books on finance and it changed my perspective of looking at money.  Told in an interesting and engaging manner, Robert Kiyosaki advocates the importance of financial literacy. By using anecdotes from his life and the lessons he learned from his two father figures, the author explains the difference between the mindset of rich and poor regarding money.  In this book, the author points out the traditional mistakes people make while handling their finances and how the educational system does not focus on financial literacy. Therefore, he encourages people to learn about accounting, financial market, taxes and investing.  One of the fascinating things that stands out in this book is the stark difference between the point of view of the rich and poor person of looking at money. The rich dad sees money in a positive light which is at odds with the popular opinion about money.  Overall, this is an informative book. It made me interested in learning about finance and managing money in a better way. If you want to learn about finance, I highly recommend this book.  24 book reviews: This Review   Blog   Twitter   Instagram   Support me      Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.    I am reading non-fiction books each month and I decided to read more books relating to business because I am genuinely interested in the subject and because I want to take more steps in this field. There are a few huge books when it comes to this field and this book is one of them. There are a lot of mixed reviews about it and I can see why. Simply put, Kiyosaki is an excellent business man but he is a mediocre author.  I can not say that the author who is a multi-millionaire is not an expert when it comes to money because he apparently is. The problem is that what is provided in the book is very basic and if it provided me with anything, it would be motivation rather than concrete knowledge. The author have a few things to say but he stretched them out over more than 200 pages of how people suck when it comes to managing money. How his rich dad  Groomed  him to become successful and then there is the chicken little example the author was very proud of.  The thing is that some of the advice written in the book can only work when there are classes of people, the rich and the poor. If everyone decided to live by the rules in this book then it won t work because it depends on people working with low salaries and shitty circumstances just because they won t fight against it.  Another thing that made me stop and think was the praise that Kiyosaki pours toward Donald Trump and though this was written decades ago and the author is obviously impressed by Trumps financial success, it made me think if money is the sole measurement the author uses in his life. Jump to the last couple of years showed another image of Trump which made the example leave a bitter taste in my mouth!  Long story short is that this is not a life-changing book. It has a few basic concepts that it repeats again and again while crapping on educated people and assuming a very westernized measures about money and success. The reason that made me give this an additional start (two stars instead of one) is that it kind of made me motivated to read and do more!  25 book reviews: 2021- j  update'as, skirtas  iam  edevrui: Mr. Kiyosaki-san, sir, would you be so kind to fuck off?

After reading 36 out of 195 pages, I have already gotten a grasp of the overall message (make your money work for you). I have also become bored with it. As a future purveyor of doctorate-level counseling/psychological services (fingers crossed, here), reading the dribble that pop-psychologists, self-made millionaires, and the like are allowed to put into print nauseates me. I will admit freely that self-help books can be and are a legitimate help to many people. But the fact that Kiyosaki continues to make so much money off of a book full of relatively obvious \"revelations\" is off-putting to say the least.  This book will sit on my bedside table a few more days for the sake of my father 's dignity. But I will be damned if I spend another spare moment reading it.  29 book reviews: The life changing book that has been a personal finance best seller for over a decade written by author Robert T. Kiyosaki. This little book has changed the lives of many people and their perspective on money, who are in misery, not knowing how to make ends meet due to lack of financial education. The contents of this book, tells the story of a young man, who is the author himself, being brought up by his natural father the conventional way of getting a job, saving every penny, working hard and climbing the corporate ladder. At the same time, he also had a \"second father\" who taught him a different way to view things and how to start from scratch and build his business into an empire.  I am sure many of us can relate to the story on the part where we were being brought up the conventional way to become workers. As much as we do not wish it to be that way, ironically, the education system plays a very big part in educating our fathers and their fathers to be trained into workers instead of educating them and inspire them to become business owners. Ignorance of other available choices, we are trapped in a eternal cycle of working for money, saving up and spending on wasting assets that constantly drains our finances and loses value over time. Welcome to the rat race! Unless we learn and educate ourselves on personal finance, we will be unknowingly stuck with only one way of thinking, and passing that knowledge on to the next generation. Talk about vicious cycle!  The main point of this book is to educate yourself on personal finance, which is to learn how to become financially independent by making money work hard for you and not you working hard to earn every single penny. It teaches you that you do not have to be a slave to money and to turn the situation to your advantage. There is no need for you to work for another person if you do not want to, in order to fulfill what you want in life. You are in control of your situation and you no longer need to take orders from anyone. You decide how much work you need. You are your own boss!  This book has certainly made a huge impact on my life, why not read it and see if it will change yours as well? Make that difference now.  Review by Ben Ang  Article Source:  ",

    " The 48 Laws of Power": "book reviews: I think this is a horrible book. Written well enough, sure, whatever, but just so very, very wrong, unless you have no morals. At least with Machiavelli you could make the excuse that he was not so much advocating what he said, but merely describing reality. This guy is advocating evil. As I read it I could not help wondering how many politicians actually think this way.  If I ever met someone who actually liked this book and wanted to live their life according to it, I would never hire that person, never work for that person, never do business with that person, and would try to avoid any and all relationships with that person. I would like to be quite remotely located physically from any such person.  The sad part is I think the author is just plain wrong. Sure, you can find powerful people who have engaged in the behaviors he espouses (I think it 's hard to call them \"laws\") and have been successful, but how many people live life this way and merely end up in the gutter with no friends, no money, and no power?  True power comes from being good, not to mention being happy, which is philosophically quite a bit more important than being powerful, although ultimately they are one and the same.  1 book reviews: When it comes to morality and ethics, people are used to thinking in terms of black and white. Conversely, \"The 48 Laws of Power\" deals primarily with the gray areas. At the risk of sounding melodramatic and trite, I say that most of the Laws covered in this book can be used for great evil or for great good. It depends on the reader. There is really nothing wrong with most of the Laws.  Each Law comes with true stories from history about those who successfully observed it and those who foolishly or naively transgressed it. Robert Greene has an interpretation for each story. Though each Law is self-explanatory, Greene 's explanations are not padding, fluff or stuffing to make the book longer. They actually give greater clarification and depth. Greene 's insight even extends to crucial warnings about how the Laws could backfire.  There are two reasons to read this book:  1. For attack: To gain power, as have others who have carefully observed the Laws;  2. For defense: To be aware of ways that people may be trying to manipulate you.  2 book reviews: i learned to be eviiiilll with this book....haha actually this book made me realize how shady people can be. Plus how smart you and ambitious you should be about succeeding in life. You got to stand out in this world. If you roll with the bunches you will become lost. You always have to have a good reputation or if you have a certain reputation you better use it to your advantage (damn im evil hahaha). This book will expose and teach you alot about the real world. One of my first books i really read and enjoyed. it motivated me to keeping learning about myself and people. i highly recommend it.  3 book reviews: This is a manifesto for misery.  It 's a book about crushing your \"enemies\", mistreating your friends, screwing over anyone and everyone to get ahead. But... for what? Anyone who genuinely thinks power is the ultimate goal of life needs a hug, not a (deranged and deluded) book praising the behaviour of totalitarian dictators (some responsible for the deaths of millions) as people to be admired and emulated.  The publishers of this book did us all a favour by designing the cover to look like a literal red flag -- if someone I knew recommended this book I would run very far away.  4 book reviews: I hated every word of this manual for the soulless. It 's a perfect example of exactly what 's wrong with Big Pharma, big business, Wall Street, and in short capitalism as it 's currently practiced. This book, which is kinda-sorta a synthesis of many previous Me First directives (Machiavelli leaps to mind), is a handbook on how to fuck over everyone you come in contact with, in order for you to get \"ahead\" and \"succeed\". It would be awesome for sociopaths and wanna-be-CEOs. It plunged me into despair. Parts of it actually raised gooseflesh on my arms while I was reading, I was so freaked out.  Repellent. Utterly amoral. Reprehensible. Negative 300 million zillion stars.  5 book reviews: This book belongs in the category of sad-but-true. For those who have a moral objection to the amoral approach of the authors presentation, I understand your feelings, but I think you miss the point. No matter how we feel about the dubious power plays that have occurred throughout history and that occur in our contemporary private and public lives, the fact is that they exist. Here are 48 approaches to power that you will either attempt to use or you will experience them being used against you at some point in your life, whether you agree with it ethically or not. If you are one who chooses to never use power over another, at least educate yourself to recognize the subtle and not so subtle ways others will attempt to use power against you. Many a despot would have been dis-empowered had their subjects been aware of the mind-games we humans have consistently used against one another throughout history. It may even be that the lack of this knowledge is as responsible for the abuse of power as the propagation of it.  Full of fun and interesting historical anecdotes, this is a thoroughly entertaining read.  6 book reviews: For all the readers and reviewers who do not \"get\" or like this book, here 's what you are not getting: It is fact. This book is not teaching anyone to be amoral. It is teaching you how people really are in the real world. It separates the behaviors and tactics of people in history who have succeeded and failed into the 48 \"Laws\". It is an explanation of power in the only way it can be expressed. If you do not want to be a deceitful heartless prick who does whatever he can to whomever all for personal gain, then I praise you. However, YOU STILL NEED TO READ THIS BOOK to protect yourself from aforementioned amoral deceitful pricks. I read this book with this understanding(which Greene also suggests in the book), and came away from it very enlightened. Live your life as you see fit, but I always recommend facing reality in its purest rawest form, and this book really uncovers the seedy underbelly of how powerful people interact with one another.  7 book reviews: If the author is evil for writing this...am I evil for enjoying it? 8 book reviews:                  \"              \" ..  ..                           ! ..

I foolishly thought it was going to be a strongly researched and thoughtful historical investigation into the nature of power with 48 astute observations similar to Good to Great or other thoughtful research.  This books is probably written for and is appealing to the shallow and overconfident who seek to take more from the world than they give by using the perpetually infantile \"well, they are doing it!.\"  If you are committed to understanding the human condition and pushing our socio-evolution to higher and higher levels of mutuality, collaboration, and \"peace on earth, good will toward\" one another, this book is either comedy, parody, or pathetic. Maybe the author has his tongue in his cheek like Rush Limbaugh who makes bazillions whipping the ignorant into a frenzy. I find that annoying. I find this book annoying.  More concretely, there are two ways to research or investigate a subject; one is to know already what you believe and then find examples that you can stick into your belief system. A good example of this is Creationism. Another good example of this is this book. The other, more...what shall I say, interesting way is to wonder about something, investigate it, look at your findings and see what what you can make of it - even if you do not like what you find.  The world, in my view, is moving - slowly - to a more beautiful way to think about power (Read Robert Greenleaf 's The Servant Leader for starters, then read something like The Joy of Work by Bakke and, again, Collins' Good to Great where we find great leaders \"looking out the window\" when things go well and \"looking in the mirror\" when things go badly).  You ca not talk people out of listening to Rush Limbaugh and those people will love this book. I think I just wandered into the wrong bar. My bad.  10 book reviews: Robert Greene took all the philosophies from Sun Tzu, Machiavellian, and many others and extrapolated them to the current world to help us understand more about the real world and the people living in it. He tells us how to distinguish between right and wrong and the best ways to behave when we are facing a crisis. The only thing you must be careful while reading this book is that you should pick up the ideas that will be helpful for you from this book and try to see whether it is morally correct in your case before trying to implement it.     11 book reviews: This is like a how-to manual for sociopaths. My office is full of them.  The most useful part of this book is that you might more quickly identify the type of sociopaths who circlejerk over stuff like this in your workplace. Usually the same sort who got their online MBA writing thesis papers on books like this one, the art of war, and seven habits of highly effective people.  Every one of the 48 rules of power has an example of \"obeying the rules: great success\" and \"did not obey the rule, probably died a miserable failure\". All of these examples are generally from like 900AD and involve politics from the 4th dynasty of Burma or some stupid irrelevant shit like that.  The author has an attitude that everyone is a horrible person who is out to get you if you do not do so first, and his contempt for people seeps through when he constantly refers to people who do not play the power game as \"fools\" and \"suckers\".  If you have ever used the term \"cats-paw\" unironically, you might enjoy this book!  12 book reviews: https://youtu.be/gI3uAFuKWFU                                         .        .                                           .                                                                                     .                                        .                                                 .                                                                 .                                  .                                                                                                                            .                                  .                                         .                                                     .                                                                                                      .                                                              .                                                             .                                                                                                   .                                                               ...                           .                                                                      .                                                                                       .                                                           .                                                                                                   ...                   .                                         ....                                                                                   .                                          .                  .                                                 .                  .                                            .                                                                   .                                  .                       .                                                                                      .                                                   .                                      .                                                                               .                                                  .                        .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 .

I bought this book way back in '01, almost as a joke--it was so politically incorrect, but mostly for the stellar historical references-- remember, he who forgets the past is destined to repeat it. Little did I realize this tome was to become one of the most dog-eared and spine-cracked books in my collection. Initially, I was trying to make sense of the havoc that schemers and liars were wreaking upon me. I used to be naive & innocent, kinda. But then I started relying on some, but not all, of the laws to survive and thrive. Some great lessons from this book:  1. Learn to control your emotions. 2. Contingency. Flexibility. Have a \"Plan B.\" 3. Learn from your past. 4. Life is a game, do not take it personally.  What I ca not seem to learn is how to conceal my intentions, and play the role of a \"courtier.\" That said, I can unconditionally and unequivocally recommend this book, just for the mini liberal arts \"Western Civ\" education you will receive. Read it, you will have some good conversation at random water coolers and cocktail parties, you might even score a spot on Jeopardy, but you will definitely kick some poor, weak, sots ass at Trivial Pursuit.  15 book reviews: The book is little more than a collection of conflicting laws that are supported only by anecdotal evidence. Good for entertainment and historical vignettes but no real substance or takeaways here. 16 book reviews: A book of wisdom, a compilation of tactics, hordes of to-avoid mistakes, rich set of brilliant tested ideas for thriving.  Although many of the rules might seem devilish, they would better be considered as lessons to be aware of in perilous social life.  This book is unspeakably well written. Everyone can definitely benefit having it read for its lessons are ones that have been tested and utilized throughout the history by bold figures.  I really enjoyed this book and learned an intense amount of knowledge.  17 book reviews: Definitely read this book if you are planning on being a war general soon. Or if you want to destroy your \"enemies.\"  If you want to be happy, probably this book is useless for you. Most of the models of power ended up being killed or miserable.  This book is pretty useful--anyone who does not see it as satire or rates it as 5 stars, you should probably avoid in your daily life--they think you are tool and are incapable of human love.  18 book reviews:   4           .        . https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...   22                                                                    :     .                                          .                                2018.                                           .   couter   (70) :   -       par     #np sur #SoundCloud                         .                             .                    .                    .                    .         .                                   \"    \"              \" \" *                           .                                                   .                     .                     .                        .                     .                             \"                                       \"            .                                    .                            .                                                                                :                     .                                              .         .                           .                     .               .  couter   (70) :   -       par     #np sur #SoundCloud .       pdf.   23 november 2018   19 book reviews:                          :                         ..                            ..                     ..                  ..                                                                                      ..                   ..               ..        20 book reviews: Let me start by stating that I was EXTREMELY skeptical about this book, though I had heard so much about it prior to reading it (I do not know, maybe it was the mood I was in). My first thoughts while reading the preface were \"Oh god...please do not let this be another book written from the point of view of an arrogant, self centered, self absorbed, narrow minded individual who only sees the world from his end of the spectrum, and believes that without his personal philosophy the rest of us mere mortals would be doomed!\" I am pleased to say that I was TOTALLY wrong and pleasantly surprised. I loved this book!   I give the author a tremendous amount of credit for even attempting to take on an issue as COLOSSAL as power and sum it all up in 430 pages. As I stated earlier I was extremely skeptical and was under the impression that this book would be mainly propaganda infused and maybe laced with a little personal philosophy here and there. As I dug deeper into this great work though, I found that the author 's personal philosophy actually takes a backseat to the historical references and stories that would eventually take center stage and serve as an excellent way to prove his point and drive it home. I found the accounts of the different powerful figures from ancient civilization all the way up to modern times to be very effective, logical, and convincing. It 's always hard to disagree with someone when there 's a clear cut example to support the claim.   Now I would not recommend this book to the faint of heart. I reiterate that as the author had to have tough skin to address the topic of power, so should the reader in order to read this book and understand it, let alone enjoy it. This book addresses power from every single angle and aspect of it; from exercising power over ones self and his or her own actions, to having power over other people and their actions. I was expecting a lot of sugar coating and flattering words (as you usually get when power is being addressed) but to the contrary there was a boldness and a distinctly honest quality about this book. That had to have taken a lot of courage...salute. The fact that this was Robert Greene 's 1st book is commendable in that respect.   The word \"game\" often resurfaces throughout in reference to power,(to whom it may concern) I found that interesting. Power took on the form of politics(which I am not usually into) and leadership was addressed in an almost microscopic type fashion which made the read more interesting. Some of my favorite historical figures appear throughout also to add clarity. People like Julius Caesar, Otto Von Bismarck, and Sun Tzu have recurring roles in this extreme display of excellence.    Power is more times than often romanticized and made to seem alluring and seductive, but very few people dare to explore the object of it from every angle and address the dangers that abound when it is abused; making it easy for an author to inadvertently send an unsuspecting reader of one of these \"in a perfect world\" type books into a merciless, unrelenting, and unforgiving environment only to be devoured due to misguidance and unpreparedness. The 48 Laws Of Power is not one of those books.    Now there are things that I TOTALLY disagree with in this book. There were portions that I read and thought to myself \" I would never do anything like that.\" On the flip side I was glad that those parts were included also because they gave me insight in to the psyche of the person who would and actually does the things that I choose not to do. Then there are also parts that I TOTALLY agree with; parts that I read and got EXTREMELY excited about! I found myself saying \"now that 's EXACTLY what I would do!\" I personally think that 's what makes for a great read. Having the notoriously wicked villain only makes you love the heroic character all the more.   The 48 Laws Of Power has a little bit of everything in it. Power is addressed, so naturally there 's deceit, greed, treachery, corruption, and scandal involved. There 's a hint of romance with ancient tales like the story of Ninon de Lenclos and Marquis de Serigne. There 's also a pinch of heartbreak like you would find in the story of King Henry the 13th and Catherine of Argon: both aspects of power that I just happen to find fascinating. Surprisingly there were also instances in which those who appeared to be powerful were actually powerless for whatever reason. This book addresses power from every angle, legitimate and illegitimate, in an unbiased way and I appreciated and enjoyed that aspect immensely.   I recommend this book to the man or woman who has reached a crossroad in his or her life and has found themselves staring down the barrel of a powerful decision... either become or remain a subordinate: a life where there 's a lot less risk, danger, and treachery involved...or Boss Up: take initiative and pursue a position of leadership and endure the hardships, responsibilities, and drawbacks that being a leader entails. I would also recommend this book to the person who has already acquired a position of leadership somehow, whether it be through hard work and sacrifice, or simply through inheritance. I think all such would find this book to be a tremendous help in deciding on whether to simply bask in what has already been given to you and carry on tradition, or blaze your own path and set your own rules...make your mark.   This may be an oldie to some, but I am sure there are still a few that have yet to take a gander at this and marvel as I did. In conclusion: real will always recognize real and it is impossible for one to miss the realness that resides between the pages of The 48 Laws Of Power... Salute.  21 book reviews: I have seen many people disliking this book because it 's evil. What they do not understand that this book is meant to be evil. And in its execution, it was spectacular. This book is a classic.  I think the world is a horrible place because good people do not understand evil scheme, or ca not plot evil scheme when its necessary to fight the evil. As evil minds are generally ruthless in executing their schemes, they win most of the time. To fight it, you must play dirty when necessary.  That being said, this book has enormous seductive power which could transform you to a manipulating mind. Here are a few laws that I particularly liked..  Law 1: Never outshine your master. Law 4: Always say less than necessary. Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people 's self interest, never to their mercy or gratitude. Law 19: Know who you are dealing with, do not offend the wrong person. Law 40: Despise the free lunch. Law 46: Never appear two perfect.  What makes the book a fun read is that each law is bolstered by historical stories, where either observance of the law or transgression of the law is exemplified. So the reader can relate the laws to real life scenarios, even in his own life.  This is an exceptionally well written book.  22 book reviews: If you want to be known as a psychopath, let this be your bible. 23 book reviews: - \"   \"                                          .                                                                            .  -            :                                                                                                              (     )          .                      !                                  .  -                                                        .                                      !              .  -                                                      .  -                                                                              .    24 book reviews: Wow. Where to start? I really didn t know what I was getting into with this book. I found it in my Kindle library (probably bought it as a daily deal at some point) and I vaguely remembered a couple bloggers I follow have mentioned it. The premise seemed interesting (sounded to me like a lot of interesting examples of historical leadership), so I dove in. After reading one chapter, I had to go research this book more because I couldn t figure out what I was reading.  After a quick consult with Wikipedia, I learned the book is popular with  prison inmates and celebrities  and some further research revealed how controversial the book is due to the themes of seduction, manipulation, and war (the book has been banned in some US prisons as a supposed security measure). With that context, I realize this is definitely not the usual book I would read, but my (morbid) curiosity was sparked and I like reading different points of view.  But this point of view was scary. The author describes the world as a battlefield, and we all need to manipulate and deceive each other in our quest for power. The author and I clearly have very different definitions of power   power to me is gained through trust and respect, not destruction and cruelty. My mouth dropped open almost every time I started reading about a new law and I would have to take a couple breaths to calm down. Here are some of the gems that really made my blood pressure rise:   Our good name and reputation depend more on what we conceal than what we reveal. Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for such moments.  (Law 26   Keep Your Hands Clean)   If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most famous, most powerful person you can find.  (Law 6 - Court Attention at All Cost)   Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes   maybe they mean it, often they do not.  (Law 2 - Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies)   Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.  (Law 11   Learn To Keep People Dependent on You)  Law 7   Get Others To Do the Work For You, But Always Take the Credit no further commentary needed on this one.  It s also worth mentioning the multiple references to obeying your  master  throughout the book   you should protect your master 's ego at all costs by only doing what s asked of you and acting dumber than you are if necessary. All of this is terrible leadership (and life!) advice. I noticed that a lot of the  laws  are contrary to currently accepted advice on being a good leader and a good citizen. The book was published in 1998, and admittedly I was still in high school at that time and living in a bubble under my parents  roof, but the world hasn t changed that much, right?? I know we ve made advances in social equality and inclusion since then (although there s still a long way to go), but I don t really think this was sound counsel 20+ years ago either.  The concepts weren t actually all bad. There are some messages in the book, like actions speak louder than words and don t be unnecessarily cruel to people, but the whole thing is just framed as life is a war and the ultimate goal is to manipulate everyone around you. For example, in Law 14   Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy (after a while, you can t help but laugh at the titles of the laws!), the main example is that a big-time art dealer wanted Andrew Mellon s business in the early 1900s. The art dealer did a lot of research on what Mellon liked and found a way to get in front of Mellon to show him his expertise and that he understood Mellon s tastes. Mellon was impressed, hired the guy, and ended up with an art collection he loved. And the art dealer guy got the commission that he was looking for. To me, this sounds like taking an interest in someone and creating mutual value   good business advice for anyone trying to sell something. But the book made this into some elaborate spy game where the art dealer was just trying to manipulate the unsuspecting millionaire for his own personal gain.  Although I m sure I m completely undermining my  power  by saying this, I like to try to find the good in everything. As a result, I resigned myself to stop hate-reading the book around the fifth chapter and just accept it for what it is. I wasn t going to agree with most of the author s views, but each law was  supported  by an interesting story about a historical figure. Most of the examples were of egotistical men (with a few women sprinkled in) trying to manipulate and deceive each other, but there were a lot of interesting stories from ancient China and the Roman Empire, and I came away from the book with a list of some people and places I want to learn more about (preferably from less belligerent books!).  But then I got to Law 27   Play on People s Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following. You shouldn t let gullibility go to waste and, in order to form your own cult, you just need to  simply follow the five steps of cultmaking that our charlatan ancestors perfected over the years.  I had to call it and officially mark this book as DNF, I can t do another 200+ pages of this. This book is so confusing to me and I began to wonder if there was some joke I wasn t getting, because the author can t be serious. In one last ditch effort to understand, I found a 2012 article from The Guardian with Robert Greene s thoughts on his book. He said,  I believe I described a reality that no other book tried to describe. I went to an extreme for literary purposes because I felt all the self-help books out there were so gooey and Pollyanna-ish and nauseating.  I appreciate that perspective and this book is definitely like no other I have read, but I guess Mr. Greene and I just experience different realities and his extreme is a little too extreme for me.  If you see life as a giant war that needs to be won, this is the book for you. But please don t read it. The concepts in this book won t give you the  power  you re looking for in this world. There are a lot more productive books out there to guide you on how to become more influential and respected.  25 book reviews: Robert Greene has done an excellent job of distilling how power works at the macro level, among great generals, statesmen, larger-than-life seducers, and even top CEOs at Fortune 500 companies. But most of us do not experience power in the way that is presumed by these examples. Most of us experience a much more fluid, shifting, and consensus-based form of power among people whom we must work with over and over again over many years and cannot afford to treat as disposable. This book is of limited value for understanding power in such normal, everyday situations where those exercising power lack the ability to behead, poison, or even to fire those with whom they work. The book works very well as a history of how absolute power has been accumulated, preserved, and lost. It works much less well as an set of instructions for how to exercise influence in a world where power is much more diffuse and unstable than it is in almost any of the examples that the author relies on as the basis for his \"laws.\"  26 book reviews: I could not stomach this book so to be fair I only finished about a quarter of it so I ca not speak for the whole thing. A friend recommended it to me. It seemed to justify selfishness on these somewhat flawed ethics-based arguments. I think it 's a recommended reading for business majors. Some folks love it. A good book to check out on power that takes a somewhat different approach is Thich Naht Hanh 's \"The Art of Power\". 27 book reviews: On my way to become a gatekeeping gaslighting girlboss   28 book reviews:                                  .                        .                                              .                              .  :                                                .                      .                                                         .        .                                  :                      .     :                                  .                     .                .                      .       :              .                        .                                                .                              :                                 .                                    .                                      .                                 .       .                                    .                              .       :                                      .                    .    .                :                                         .                                    .                         :                                  .                                                                    .                                                       .                           :                                                              .                                     .                                                                   .      .                         .                .                                               .                                                                                 .                                                                 .           .                                           .                              .                        .                                 .                                                .                                                 .                                                                        .                                               .                                              .   :                                                                                        .     :                  .                        .       :                      .                                            .              .                            .        .            :                                               .                .                      .                                         .                              .      .                 .      .                                                                         .       : \"                                                                       .              .     :                                                                                                        .                                                         .                           .                                                              :                                    .                    :                 .                                  .                  .                  .                                                                   .                 .                                .                                      .          .      .                :                             .                                      .                    .                                                                                                           .                                          .    29 book reviews: This book is funny, but not as much as the Amazon and Goodreads reviews. You have the people who took it seriously and gave it five stars. And then you have the people who took it seriously and gave it one star. Lighten up, Francis!  I did not take it seriously, but instead took it for what it was: a bunch of unsourced anecdotes (a BUNCH of anecdotes...multiple per \"law\") draped in the author 's interpretations of applicability. Okay, he has a \"selected\" bibliography, but every anecdote is just presented without reference so they are just some tales packaged to illustrate a point or three. Some of those interpretations are insightful, and some are...a reach. Most are just stories loosely connected to his \"laws\".  Greene made a bunch of money selling these \"laws\" and hats off to him. I wish I did not care about what I wrote and could sell this stuff.  ",
    " The Alchemist, 25th Anniversary: A Fable About Following Your Dream": "book reviews: A vehemently optimistic fable about God, omens and personal dreams. Paulo Coelho magically thrusts the reader into a world of a young shepherd who, despite his simple background, conquers the world through bravery, curiosity and an almost divine understanding of the world.  The story unfolds rather linearly and the reader is at no point confronted with a sense of disaster or unsurmountable obstacles. Still, I enjoyed the book as a welcome journey through a magical world, in which the universe conspires to help you achieve your dreams.  Nevertheless, readers seeking greater depth in character or more intricate storylines may not find this book to their liking.  1 book reviews: It was kind of a complicated reading for me as I am a beginner but...I am so glad that I picked it up and finished reading it. As someone who 's devastated between my own dreams and my parents dream, it helped me understand my urge to seek what I want from the bottom of my heart. It helped me to be more optimistic and fight for my dream with my blood, sweat and tears. Of course, this books comes it 's own controversies but above all, This journey was amazing.  2 book reviews: What a profound book. Definitely leaves you thinking haha. The person who gave me this book was totally unexpected too, I think that just goes to show how much truth this book contains. I don t think you need to be religious to appreciate what this book teaches, I m not and yet I found so much within it that resonated with me. I think this is the kind of book that should be read a few times over, just to remind yourself to listen to the omens, to listen to your heart. 3 book reviews: ",
    " The Four Winds: A Novel": "book reviews: DNF. Couldn t do it. I m not into the depression-era story line and it just didn t grasp me. I found myself doing anything but reading. 1 book reviews: I can not recommend this book more. Truly one of the most amazing historical fiction books I ve ever read. Everyone should read this book. Especially every woman. Never forget our strength. 2 book reviews: The ending :,( wowza. 3 book reviews: This was like nothing I read before but what a good store about life struggles many years ago 4 book reviews: Reminded me of Grapes of Wrath, with its depressing story of a family living through some of the most depressing event in 100 years. The Great Depression as experienced by farmers living through the droughts of the Dustbowl. Immigration to California from Texas didn t alleviate their pain; it just changed the shape of it.  The story of three generations, and how each one struggled to find something true.  Another book this made me think of is The Last Ballad, about textile mills and strikes in NC.  5 book reviews: This book showed the strength it took physically and emotionally to survive with little to nothing. I felt some of the characters showed how vital it was to have each other for support while other characters showed the ugliness of greed. This book both warmed and broke my heart. 6 book reviews: I found the story dragged at times but it made you really feel how desolate it was. Great ending!!!! 7 book reviews: Such a good book!! Ahh. I read it all in one day I couldn t stop reading. Seriously, go buy this book now 8 book reviews: Couldn t put it down. I got very invested in these characters. I worried and cried with them.

    " The Hill We Climb: An Inaugural Poem for the Country": "book reviews: hearing it for the first time was breathtaking and now reading it for the first time was moving 1 book reviews: When day comes, we ask ourselves: Where can we find light In this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We have braved the belly of the beast We have learned that quiet is not always peace\"  Even more than reading it, better watch it performed by the author:  The gestures, the crisp rhythm, the absolution of the moment, to feel like perhaps COVID and the last four years of hatefulness might possibly wash off in the sunny, cold January morning, spoken.     The words written on the page, so simple in their form and meter do not do the performance justice.     2 book reviews: Since this poem was banned from a Miami, Florida school district, here it is in full: When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry. A sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast. We have learned that quiet is not always peace, and the norms and notions of what \"just\" is is not always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that is not broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that does not mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we will forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we are to live up to our own time, then victory wo not lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we have made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It 's because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It 's the past we step into and how we repair it. We have seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour. But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, become the future. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children 's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover. And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it.  If you enjoyed this and are interested in more of her works, I definitely recommend her full collection .  3 book reviews: My youngest daughter gifted me with this lovely book. Beautifully binded with yellow dust jacket, red lettering, a play on the outfit she wore while reciting this poem at the inauguration..Gorman is so young and so talented.  Some of my favored sentences from the poem. \"That even as we grieved, we grew, That even as we hurt, we hoped, That even as we tired, we tried.\"  Words that could be used in many different setting, but certainly during this past year of Covid, when so many have sickened and died.  \"For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\"  How will we measure up?  4 book reviews: 4.5   From Amanda 's Twitter Account.  \"One parent could get my poetry banned from classrooms. And yet one country ca not ban assault rifles from massacring them.\"   The complaint;    The complainant thought Oprah was the author (Oprah wrote the foreword) & the complainant did not even have to fill out her full name.  My understanding is that at this stage, the school has only banned it for elementary school pupils.  While this poem might be challenging for very young children, there is nothing harmful in the ideas it expresses. It is wonderful that a young woman can dream of becoming president of (at the time of writing this) the most powerful nation on earth. The use of language is lovely, yet does not gloss over America 's past & present problems. I have marked it down just slightly because some lines are a little awkward.  If you want to see Amanda read this poem again;    Edit: & yay for the Streisand Effect.      5 book reviews: Oh America, you can do better than this.  The poem is verbose, unimaginative, condescending, self-indulgent, didactic and - what is worst - cliched. It is understandable that American hearts may need reassurance and guidance after years of darkness and chaos - yes, the poem does provide those. But if one strips the poem of its envelope of powerful oral delivery, colourful cloths, ethnic jewels, identity politics associated with the author and the specific context of delivery, one is left with a bunch of cliched verses that could be taken straight from a 10th grade assignment:  Write something symbolic and solemn about Thanksgiving Day .  Everyone is entitled to its own feelings when it is about art. To a lesser extent, everyone is also entitled to its own ideas about art. The dilemma is that when cliched art is celebrated as profound and meaningful, and is made mainstream and institutional by the public endorsement, that means that (political) ideas are also cliched.  It is sadly possible that many Americans might not be terrified that what the nation s youth poet graduate creates is little different from what an automatic generator of trite expressions and cheap allegory can produce. It will indeed be more troublesome for those same Americans that a new presidential administration which is vehemently underscoring its departure from the dark past uses cliched art to make its message resonate with the people.  6 book reviews: It 's a good thing Harold Bloom is already dead because hearing this poem would have killed him. Gorman 's work was an utterly dreadful, clich -ridden piece of juvenilia that had all the charm and sense of craft as a mediocre slam poem. 7 book reviews: Review originally published April 29, 2021  I confess I do not read poetry that much, but I am glad I went ahead and read The Hill We Climb: An Inaugural Poem for the Country (2021). Written by the youngest poet yet to give a poetry reading at a presidential inauguration, Amanda Gorman 's poem \"The Hill We Climb\" is powerful, sobering, and uplifting all at the same time.    While critics of the poem pointed out that it was clich  and full of platitudes, I found \"The Hill We Climb\" communicating deeper, rather than shallower, ideas regarding America 's reckoning with its history as we move into the future. I do not disagree with the critics about the presence of platitudes in places, but what did they expect out of a poem given at a full of pomp and circumstance and patriotic symbolism?  Generally, inaugurations are times of , proof that American democracy persists with the peaceful transfer of power between administrations. It 's a time for a president to broadcast their big ideas for the nation, with the idea of motivating citizens to step up to the challenge. Moreover, coming after the events of January 6th, the hope that exudes from Gorman 's writing despite everything that 's gone on lately is something we all could use a little more of these days. No one wants fire and brimstone!    I would imagine it was a difficult balance for Gorman, trying to be both happy and uplifting without missing the sobering and serious nature of America 's historical wrongs and their legacy in the present. All in all, I think she navigated this balance wonderfully.  In the present moment, we grapple still with the COVID pandemic and the aftermath of a transition of administrations. Gorman communicates to us in \"The Hill We Climb\" that we are not a perfect nation, but what matters is that after being knocked down many times, each time we get up and continue the work towards a more perfect union. A message of hopeful resiliency that is a refreshing change of pace.  -Cora  Find this book and other titles within .  8 book reviews: I was one of millions around the world who hadn t heard of Gorman before she performed this poem at Biden s inauguration. And it was more of a performance than a reading. It s good on the page, but better if you can see and hear her, even if only from memory. Watch it, HERE, and if that doesn t work for you, search YouTube or Google.   : ()  You need to read or watch the whole poem, but here are my favourite lines:       ...      ...       I went on to read her new collection, , which I reviewed , with general comments about her style and themes.  9 book reviews: Let 's face it: No one needed this formulaic foreword by Oprah, but the poem and its delivery are GREAT. 10 book reviews: Oscar Wilde once remarked wickedly that poetry fared well until the public became interested in it. I am hard pushed to understand how anyone could mistake this collection of cliches and flaccid lines for poetry. 11 book reviews: \"There is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it.\" -Amanda Gorman  This beautiful, inspirational poem, by the immensely talented Amanda Gorman, was the perfect way to close the door on one of the darkest periods in U.S. history.  Amanda 's recitation of this poem at the Presidential inauguration left my whole family in tears. Personally, I was so happy to see the emergence of this wonderful new role model for my daughter, at the same time that we swore in our first female vice president. Truly a moment to remember forever.  Now let 's all hope we can live up to the ideals set forth by Amanda at this turning point in history.  12 book reviews: \"We will not march back to what was, But move on to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, Benevolent but bold, Fierce and free.\"  I watched Amanda performing this at the inauguration and was absolutely blown away. Reading the words months later in a book itself was a spectacular experience too. (If you have not seen Amanda speaking at the ceremony, go fix that!!! It 's really too good.)  And I am even more excited to read her debut poetry collection. Her way with words is so powerful and soothing. (And the USA has a loooooong way to go with practicing democracy, but this poem definitely comforted me.)  13 book reviews: Wonderful! 14 book reviews: Very worthy for Independence Day weekend... I remember her recitation at the inauguration and how moved I was then... an important young voice, I hope she publishes more! 15 book reviews: 3,5   16 book reviews: September 30,2021 Re-read :  We have braved the belly of the beast. We have learned that quiet is not always peace, And the norms and notions of what \"just is\" Is not always justice.   I listened to the audiobook while reading this book. To be honest, I did not really care for Oprah 's foreward and personally preferred Gorman 's reading at the inauguration over the reading from the audiobook version.  However, the more I read this, the more I realized that the reason why I like  's poetry so much is because it 's easy to read and understand, while maintaining great rhythm and lyricism. The writing is also just beautiful! I ca not get enough of Amanda Gorman.  : I have never watched any of the past US inaugurations, but when Amanda Gorman shared the glorious news that she was selected as the official inaugural poet for the 2021 inauguration, I knew I had to tune in (and I did)!  If you have not watched it, you can find it   I have been following Gorman in social media since last summer and (for some reason) feel immensely proud of her well-deserved fame and success and am super happy that all three of her books ( - a picture book set to release later this year, - the collection of poems under the same title as this one, as well as ) took the top three spots on the Amazon bestseller list!  17 book reviews: Like so many people, I have watched Amanda Gorman during the inauguration, and her speaking this poem was so amazing. Reading it, with the different but nice format used, is wonderful too. With The Hill We Climb you have an awesome poem full of hope for a better future without hiding the past. 5 out of 5 stars 18 book reviews: I borrowed this audiobook thinking it was a book of poetry but as it turns out, just the one poem was more than enough. Despite the unnecessary forward by Oprah, this reading of the Inaugural Poem by the author was stunning. It brought me to tears. 5 stars 19 book reviews: Truly inspirational and uplifting. Amanda 's words breathe life and hope in my heart and hopefully yours too. 20 book reviews: Nei momenti di buio, quando l'irreparabile incombe e sembra che non resti altro da fare che arrendersi all'ineluttabile, come se non ci fosse altro da fare, perch  l'angoscia e la disperazione hanno sprangato le porte alla speranza, alla vita, alla luce. Quando la NONVITA trionfa, nel buio pesto della notte senza stelle, dove \"c'  solo pianto e stridore di denti\", ecco che si erge una voce limpida, cristallina che come raggio di sole squarcia \"l'ombra senza fine\".    la voce di Amanda Gorman, che con tutta la sua forza ha parlato durante l'insediamento del presidente Joe Biden, il 20 gennaio 2021       Nasce il giorno e ci chiediamo: Dove trovare la luce In quest ombra senza fine? La perdita che portiamo, un mare da guadare.  Abbiamo sfidato il ventre della bestia, Appreso che la calma non   sempre pace, E che le regole e opinioni del  cos    Non sempre sono giustizia.   E allora apriamo i nostri cuori alla Speranza. Alziamo lo sguardo per permetterci di farlo posare non su ci  che ci divide, ma su ci  che   davanti a noi. E aggiungo, non su chi   davanti, ma su chi   a fianco, per capire che le differenze non sono segni di divisione, ma sono fonte di ricchezza e di arricchimento.  \"Deponiamo le armi Per armarci di premura gli uni verso gli altri Di nessuno vogliamo il male, per tutti l'armonia.\"   Deponiamo le armi, s , per armarci di cura, sotto il cielo dell'armonia. Se sapremo prenderci cura allora saremo in grado di superare l'interesse particolare a favore del bene collettivo. Il virus Sars-Cov2 ci sta imponendo questa lezione. Chiss  se avremo abbastanza cuore e cura per apprenderla. Noi siamo ci  che costruiamo. Noi siamo molto pi  della somma delle singole parti. Noi siamo le relazioni che scegliamo di avere. Noi siamo la visione che saremo in grado di donarci.  \"E se prima chiedevamo: Come potremmo avere la meglio sulla catastrofe? Ora affermiamo: Come potrebbe la catastrofe avere la meglio su di noi?\"   \"Ma una cosa   certa: Se alla compassione uniamo la forza, e alla forza la ragione, L'amore sar  il nostro retaggio, E il cambiamento, un diritto per i nostri figli.\"  21 book reviews: This is an exceptional poem - modern and contemporary in the best sense of the word. Rhythmic without strict metre or rhyme schemes. Full of powerful images despite a very clear, sober language. 22 book reviews: This is possibly the most moving piece of poetry I have ever heard.  I am not an American, but on inauguration day I found myself in awe of this young Black girl with the hands of a dancer and the heart of a woman forced to be much wiser than her years. I found myself in tears.  Amanda Gorman 's spirit moved me then, and it moved me once again while listening to this audiobook.  I can only hope that America, and the world, can live up to the potential of this young woman 's words.  Words that soar so seamlessly into our hearts, giving them wings to fly.  \"For there is always light, if only we re brave enough to see it. If only we re brave enough to be it.    VIDEO REVIEW:  You can find me on... | |  Thank you to Libro.fm for providing an ALC of The Hill We Climb.  23 book reviews: THIS. IS. SO. GOOD.  Powerful. Changemaker. Astonishing.  Thanks to Libro.FM for the ALCs for this one. 24 book reviews: I am not going to rate this, this has just been sitting in my Libro.fm app unlistened to, and I thought that it would be nice to have a refresher of what made this such a good poem at Joey 's inauguration... and I have to admit that it did not hit quite as hard...  Also Oprah... that introduction? I know she a billionaire now, but that was just very lazy work. It 's giving she wrote it on a cocktail napkin after she and Gayle got back from a hike around Oprah 's garden.  25 book reviews: I enjoy reading Ms Gorman 's poem as much as I did hearing it the first time at the inauguration. Brilliant, not just considering her young age. 26 book reviews: Breathtaking. I watched this performed live along with my husband and child, and we all wept openly. Cannot wait to read more from this brilliant mind! 27 book reviews: Listened to the audiobook, because I needed a reminder that there is hope even though there is so much tragedy. Sigh. It s a great poem, and a great listen. Maybe not the same chills I had when I first heard it, but the power and the memory of the day are there!   Quiet is not always peace and the norms and notions of what just is is not always justice.   **Audio copy downloaded from Libro.fm proceeds helping Loyalty Bookstores.  28 book reviews: Sch n, dass der Text zweisprachig ver ffentlicht  wurde, insbesondere dass einige der sprachlichen Bilder erl utert werden.

But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you are safe with me'- that 's intimacy.    This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It 's a pure 5 star for me. I am irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I could not leave it down. I just could not. . It 's , I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I am casually reading this book. I am on page , 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I could not survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let 's talk specifics.        Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the and kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.  I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I did not quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I am into the book 100%, ready to know about . The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There were not any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I would not have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.  . Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She is not a character to me. She is a person. With influences from and , the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like \"Oh, I will watch that movie next.\", and then I remembered that she does not actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you ca not help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she is not ashamed about it. She does not give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.  . An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I did not care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn did not let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she has not achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn 's story started, we did not get much of her. But I am so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I am really proud of her.  . Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction ca not entail good representation. . We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it 's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I would not have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.  This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn 's life is so engaging and complicated, you ca not get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It 's more about talent, at the most part. I would like to hope so.  In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I am gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. . But I am scared they would ruin it. I am always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I could not recommend this enough. It does not matter if you do not read historical fiction or adult, . You wo not regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!  2 book reviews:  Evelyn always leaves you hoping you ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.   This book was so, so, so GOOD!! I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I d love it with all my heart! <3 There s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!  We didn t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean  Hollywood Digest ,  Sub Rosa  or the  New York Tribune , they all wrote about Evelyn s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.  I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.  Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don t know what to do with them. Maybe I ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.  And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid s plan all along. ;-)          Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can t even! <333 It s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh, I think I might be in love with her! <333            Now here s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but   and here comes the huge   I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn t like that Celia wasn t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You d think a person who represents the  L  in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn s life and that made me really sad. =(           Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron was about this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_T      To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father s death was necessary to find her happiness and I m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*            Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn t let them and wouldn t have understood, because they didn t want the same thing, because they weren t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because  just There was always another reason why they couldn t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic  more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T                     Their friendship was everything, absolutely Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that  ARGH! I just them!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*           And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333            The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I m convinced everyone who reads will learn something good from it! I m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)  I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charming for this wonderful buddy read! We both didn t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we ll find another book to buddy read again! =)  3 book reviews: This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.  I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it 's only recently that I have decided that 's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.  So that 's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.  is, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.  But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn. . Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is a good character.  This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I that. Evelyn s story is one of being a woman in a man s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices were .  Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don t  I don t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but  well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.  And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.    I know I ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don t know exactly how to put into words what this book to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid this book. left me an emotional mess, but also a mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.  | | |  4 book reviews: CLICK HERE for a Booktube Video about:  Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go - does not that belong to Miranda Reads?  Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)! 3.75 stars     She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.  Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo was Each divorce only increased her fame.  Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire. And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her most and offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.  However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the most thing that has ever graced this world.  Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it 's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.   Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I do not know.  I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.  We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There 's only so many times I can hear about how a person is before it gets boring.  I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.  Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.  I really loved in this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.  Her love for throughout the years truly made this for me. Honestly,  Their love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.  Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless! | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  5 book reviews: WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.  But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I ll tell you that.  My guy, there aren t even that many characters in this book. And we re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word  Frozen  is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)  This book includes three () interracial relationships. Actually, it s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale as teen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)  This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.  I will say we don t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and  60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she s  not black enough.  I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.  But there s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I ve ever read. If you don t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.  Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she s not real.  I don t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.  A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don t want to go to specifics even a little. I m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*    Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!  *This isn t true, by the way. Duh.   ----------------------   was tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.  compromised by rereading this instead.  this was a very good plan.  ----------------------   This book? It 's really great.  I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.  6 book reviews: This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.  Could The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo really be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid 's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.  Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn 's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique ca not pass up.  When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it 's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.  I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it 's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She 's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it 's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.  The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique 's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn 's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there 's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.  I adored Reid 's writing style. It 's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It 's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I am in awe.  You guys know I am a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I am also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.  I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It 's the sort of story I know I will come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~~~~~~         7 book reviews: Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?  I ca not say for sure what drew me to this book. It 's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I have not read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably would not like it anyway. And I was HOOKED.  It 's perfect, easy beach read material. It 's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo 's story was so that it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?  The framing of the story reminded me a lot of . Like that book, in , a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. Unlike , this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.  Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn 's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?  The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she would probably do it all again. She 's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry 's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that did not like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.  I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending 's final reveals.  | | | |  8 book reviews: Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!  Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She s not only beautiful, alluring but there s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her  cut .  Now she s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for  Vivant  in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry. So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:  - Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn t, the memoir deal will be off? - Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life? - As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60 s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned  and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she s made!  It s brilliant! It s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood. Author s genuine approach to LGBTQ was better reflected than Ryan Murphy s Hollywood limited series on Netflix.  If you haven t read it, don t miss out this masterpiece and the best of the best Taylor Jenkins Reid book ( I liked it even more than Daisy Jones and the six)  My favorite quotes:  Do not ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don t do that.    You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says,  It s OK, you can fall down now. I ll catch you.    Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.   \"Do you understand what I am telling you? When you are given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world does not give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.    do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.   9 book reviews: 10 book reviews: This is genuinely one of the most remarkable novels I have ever read. It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted by The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I will never forget how much I adore this book.  CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racism abortion & suicide  Adult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging   it was a huge struggle to put the book down.  Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.  Personally, I didn t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.  is one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.)  11 book reviews: Wow! This book came in and knocked me off my feet.  Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life is not perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.  This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life is not nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?  There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.  \"There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.\"  This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. \"Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who does not know her power, but I am sick of all that.\" \"People do not find it very sympathetic or enduring, a woman who puts herself first.\"  Overall, this is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read.  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities    12 book reviews: At least I know why Evelyn recruited Monique, the worst journalist of the year, to write her biography. I thought asking astute questions was a part of interviewing a famous person. Apparently not.  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a quintessential beach read. The prose is very readable, the plot soapy. You borrow the juiciest, gossipiest parts of Elizabeth Taylor 's or Marilyn Monroe 's love lives - you get a cracktastick pulp read. It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of like . Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn 's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo 's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?  The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person 's life, but none of that person 's interiority.  Totally see why it 's a bestseller. It entertains but never challenges.  13 book reviews: Worst Read of Decade, 2011-2020 Glucose Gluttony  As Abe Lincoln observed: \"For those who like this kind of a book, it is just about the kind of a book they would like.\"  I repeatedly winced and rolled my eyes at soppy, silly prose, such as the implausible:     , a trove of , brims with bromides:           And schmaltzy advice:    Seriously. . . . If you are still on the fence after reading this review, please, by all means, read the book!  14 book reviews: Well I never thought I would see the day where I did not fall in love with a TJR book but here we are. I am sure I will be the black sheep on this and I will never understand why. I hated this book and I say that very, very infrequently. I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe. Contrived and cookie cutter are also words that come to mind and will only make sense if you read it, no spoilers here. One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance. I felt there was a huge double standard in how this relationship was portrayed based on the genders of the characters involved. This \"great love\" was abusive, emotionally draining, and not what love is in my opinion. While I am all for authors branching out and trying new kinds of books, this book just did not work for me in the least.  15 book reviews: I am going to think until I do my wrap up if this will be a 4.5 stars read or 5 star read. BUT WOW. Just know that I loved it.  No puede ser que no hubiera escuchado sobre este libro antes,  es una maravilla! Y las miles de rese as positivas lo respaldan. La historia de Evelyn Hugo te quita el aliento. Es intrigante y muy cautivadora; y es de esas de las que simplemente quieres saber M S Y M S. Yo no pod a creer lo inmersa que estaba en la lectura. Solo quer a saber m s sobre Evelyn Hugo, sus logros, sus triunfos, sus tropiezos, sus motivaciones y, obviamente, sus siete esposos.   C mo fue que se cas  siete veces? Y a n m s importante...  qui n fue realmente su gran amor?  No creo que sea un libro con mucha profundidad, pero s  muy adictivo, hace tiempo que no me la pasaba TAN BIEN y tan picada leyendo una historia. Es que WOW, me sent a dentro del libro, como si Evelyn Hugo fuera un  cono del mundo real y yo fuera su fan y quisiera conocer cada uno de sus secretos.  Me encant , de verdad.  16 book reviews: not to be dramatic, but if there ever comes a point in time where the fate of the human civilisation is coming to an end and we need to create a time capsule to immortalise our posterity, this book better be in it. there has never been a more honest and enthralling book in the history of the world, ever.  i really dont even know where to begin. its books like this which confirm my belief that fiction will always be better than nonfiction, because it would be impossible to find a biography that could paint the story of a womans life half as well as this did. this was extraordinary, in every sense of the word. just the depth of this book was spectacular. not to mention the diversity and representation and writing quality and complex characters. everything was just outstanding.  im kind of in that shocked state right now (if you didnt already notice) where im still reeling from what i just read. a more concise and coherent review will come once i calm down from being so hyped about the brilliance of this book and can process everything.   17 book reviews: trigger/content warnings: death of a loved one, death of a child, talk of suicide, unhealthy dieting, underage sex with an adult, abortion, talk of miscarriage, a lot of physical abuse, cheating, dunk driving, and homophobic slurs.  Blog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch 18 book reviews: (4.5) I ve been struggling with a lot of books lately because I just don t care about them. I don t care about the story. I don t care about the characters. I just don t care! I thought it was all me, that I must have a cold heart but then this book happened.  I thought this was a literary fiction but it read more like a chick lit. A deep chick lit if that can even be a thing. This book made me realize that it is absolutely not me but them!  I cared deeply for the flawed characters in this book. When reading a book heartless Emily does not cry. Ever. Well, I did while reading this one.  Just pick it up and read it already!  19 book reviews: A spectacular book well deserving of 5 stars. All of the characters feel like real people: complex, nuanced, and painfully human. Not only is the story incredibly diverse despite its Old Hollywood setting, it also has the best bi representation I have ever seen. The journey through Evelyn Hugo 's life is filled with trials and tribulations, love and loss, mistakes and redemption; all the while, Reid does a great job at making you feel all the emotions along the way. I left this book feeling reflective, melancholic, and touched by how many things can happen in life that are both awful and wonderful. Overall, a compelling read that is beautifully put together as it is emotionally satisfying.  20 book reviews: 21 book reviews: so unfortunate that i will pass away before i find a book that i love even half as much as this one 22 book reviews: What an extraordinary and surprising read. Absolutely adored this one. 23 book reviews: I  HOW DO I COPE???? 24 book reviews: I envy the people who will be reading this for the first time. 25 book reviews: celia the entire time: i could be a better boyfriend than him and him and him and him and him and him and him 26 book reviews: 2nd read: june 2022 - physical   loved this even more this reread. this book is pure magic.  1st read: june 2018 - audiobook   worth all the hype    27 book reviews: i ve found my new favorite book.  heart wrenching, soul crushing, this book ended me  i knew i was going to love this. i just had to push myself to pick it up. if you haven t read this book yet, what are you doing with your life. start it now, without knowing anything. because that s what i did and now i m sitting here in bed thinking i will never find a book that ll make me feel this way again.  story is so interesting & intriguing. i was reading this book all day long, unable to put it down and when i had to, all i thought about was when i could continue reading it. reading about her schemes and deceives.. just incredible. i was so invested, rooting for her and just fell in love with her like every other person in this book.  evelyn s & friendship is all i need in life. i want that mutual understanding of each other, knowing what the other means by glances only, helping & being there whenever the other needs you. their friendship is so pure and genuine, i just want to hug them.          tjr makes me feel like i know these characters, as if they were real and this story is true. i think it s mainly because we read about evelyn s story and not just a small part of it. we see and feel it all, which makes this book feel so real. i can t say much more about the characters without spoilering too much so the next part is going to be full of spoilers. don t read any further if you haven t read the book and are still planning to.    when i read the line  i did not speak to celia for five years after that  my heart broke and bled for them. i was so shocked, i seriously thought they were gonna make up right after their fight. i mean i already was heartbroken the entire time since they couldn t be who they wanted to be in front of the world, but them losing contact and being alone all over again? my heart  don t even get me started on the part when john was dying and harry had to live without him and then him finding a new love and then died   harry dying was one of the saddest parts in the book. i knew it was coming up but i didn t expect it to be in an accident. and then the reveal of why monique was chosen for evelyn s biography? tjr, you are a genius. seriously. from that moment on my heart wouldn t stop bleeding. everything that came after was just as heart shattering as harry s death. once celia died, i just felt so sad for evelyn. i wanted to hug her even if she had despised me for that. i felt her loneliness through the lines and my eyes wouldn t stop tearing up.  i just wanted them to be a big happy family. when celia and evelyn would stop talking to each other through the years, it made me so emotional.. especially when celia was talking to evelyn through her oscar speech       crying sobbing throwing up banging my head against the table, why can t they just be happy, let them be happy, please please PLEASE, i need this more than oxygen.          god i m just so emotional rn, i really need ten business days to recover if i can recover at all. this book will for sure leave a mark.   28 book reviews: edit: The first time I read this one I was pretty excited to have a latino rep here (specifically from my country, El Salvador), but then, I realized that latino characters are stereotyped as secondary, and very flat, characters, are not well developed and their only function is to serve the main character. I am talking about Luisa. The fact that immigrants are threated this way makes me sick. I loved Evelyn Hugo, but please, stop writing latino characters like this, or poc in general.       jUST EDITING TO ADD THIS:             If you have not read the book and do not wanna spoil yourself, please do not read any further. My review is full, or partially, of major and minor spoilers. And it seems like I can not restrain myself of that, lmao.  With many playlists on Spotify (wordkey: evelyn hugo), I read not knowing (very naive of my part tbh) that my heart was gonna be torn apart like a piece of paper. Huh, who would said it? And even the playlists are masterpieces, and have many Taylor 's songs, which iS SO GODDAMN PERFECT.  I must warn y'all that I am still crying.  This book is perfect. The writing, the pacing, the characters, the romance, the trageDY, MY FUCKING HEART IS BROKEN, TJR, PLEASE, WHY DID YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MY SENSITIVE HEART?  Anyhow.  We have the famous actress and gorgeous woman, Evelyn Hugo, who is known for her many movies back at the 50 's, 60 's, 70 's and 80 's, and for the scandals of her seven marriages. Evelyn Hugo is announcing that she will auction 12 of her most memorable gowns through Christie s to raise money for breast cancer research, of which her daughter, Connor, died.  Monique Grant is a reporter for the magazine, Vivant, and is specifically by Evelyn Hugo to write her autobiography, but, why Monique? What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That 's the interesting part.  So, Monique goes to Evelyn 's aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell 's Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.  She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.  My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I would have given my kidney or soul to see that movie). They both agreed to this plan and they are happy this way... Until Rex 's pair, Joy, is pregnant and they want to get married. Celia is also married with John Braverman.  Harry. hE IS MY PRETTY BABY, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. DKFJDJFGHJFG. I really loved Harry, he and Evelyn are best friends, wich makes their relationship normal and not forced. Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor. And then, everything goes downhill when Evelyn films a movie with her abusive ex-husband, Don Adler, and make a sex scene.  Celia is sick and knows she 's gonna die, so they form this plan to move to Spain, Evelyn has to marry Celia 's brother, Robert (he 's the third), so Celia 's things belong to her when she dies. They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.  When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.    It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.  The pacing was amazing. It grab you from the beginning and lemme tell you tHAT THIS WAS ADDICTIVE. I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt.  The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*  Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that. She was a wife, a mother, a lover, a friend. She was not just her talen and her great body.  I fell in love with her and her story, with many of her husbands and her wife.  My heart is broken tbh. But this book is totally worth of it.  I laughed with Evelyn, I cried with and for her, I get angry and sad... I just fell.  And the twist for Monique? Ugh, that ruined me as well.  All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who did not know she could feel more for someone else than a man. And I am glad that she and Celia got married at the end. :')  I did not know the complexity of this book, and the hype is worth it!!!  ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WANT A CELIA ST. JAMES FOR ME, OK?  ____________________ I am a mess of tears right now  RTC  29 book reviews: This book was quite literally *stunning*. I loved exploring the flawed and beautiful life of Evelyn Hugo. There 's something about this book that makes you feel like you are reading a true story & I easily found myself wrapped up in it. The pacing is something that stood out to me as the beats of the story evolved in such an engaging way. love love love! ",
    " The Song of Achilles: A Novel": "book reviews: I will never forgive you for this. 1 book reviews: dios como me destruye este libro (lo amo) 2 book reviews: I would consider this more of a 3.5 - Greek Mythology is not something I would usually opt for but this book was recommended to me a few times and once I got into it, it definitely had me hooked. I knew nothing about the myths really going into it so I think that was helpful in terms of being surprised by the plot. Overall well-written, enjoyed the narration, and I would recommend! 3 book reviews: Destroyed me. 4 book reviews: I have re-read it because I am teaching it to my class. Cried again. Great book. 5 book reviews: A wonderfully detailed of Greek mythology and history. I have been fascinated with mythology since I was about 10 when my father gave me his addition of Bulfinches Mythology. ",
    " The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music": "book reviews: Perfect for anyone who loves music or emotional intelligence!  Before you do anything, open YouTube and type in \"Dave Grohl Plays Nirvana NYC 2021.\"  This book spoke to me as a music lover. When I was in middle school, I was given a choice: a radio or TV. Of course, we were too broke to afford cable TV so the choice was easy: radio! I must have listened to Slide by the Goo Goo Dolls at least 2,000 times.  The Storyteller was an extremely entertaining memoir where Dave 's love of music shines and shines through. Dave strolls through his childhood and his days in the business, primarily with Scream, Nirvana, and the Foo Fighters. Although Dave never mentions it, he is simply a master in emotional intelligence. He spent years touring in a van with numerous other bandmates. If I had to tour in a van, I would not last more than 24 hours. Recently, there was a lawsuit filed by the baby on the cover of Nirvana 's most famous cover (now a man in his 30 's) who is claiming that he was taken advantage of and would like the cover to be altered (despite the fact that he has reenacted the cover scene many times and has stated that he did not really do anything for Nirvana). When Dave Grohl was asked what he thought, \"I have many ideas of how we should alter that cover but we will see what happens. We will let you know. I am sure we will come up with something good. I think there is much more to look forward to and much more to life than getting bogged down in those kinds of things.\" This guy is a rock star just for saying that! Instead of cutting this freeloader down to size, he went positive and said that he has a lot of creative ideas. How cool is that?!  The Storyteller had me laughing out loud often. I never even knew who Dave Grohl was before reading this book so you do not have to know who he is to enjoy it. For this book, I practiced immersion reading (listening to the audio while following along in a printed copy). The audiobook was read by Dave Grohl himself. He has an incredible rich voice that was a pleasure just to listen to. There is also about 10 minutes of bonus material in the audiobook that was not in my Kindle version.  Overall, a must read if you really love music! Rock on!  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities    1 book reviews: After listening to this audiobook, I love Dave Grohl even more - how is that fucking possible?! His memoir is full of warmth, humor, absorbing behind-the-scenes stories of rock'n'roll adventure, heartbreak and mischief, and, yes spirituality, but not of the esoteric kind, but of the \"music, friends and family are my religion\"-conviction. While other rock stars spend their careers trying to build elaborate badass images, Grohl is like \"my mom is my best friend, and my daughter taught me the names of all Disney princesses; and oh, I partied with Pantera, played a stadium rock show with a smashed leg and, you know, changed the landscape of rock with two of the biggest bands ever to exist on this planet. Now let me tell you about my friend Tom Petty. Is not life wild?\"  Grohl seems like an extremely hard-working, humble, intelligent guy who has never fallen into the trap of rockstar kayfabe, he is not chasing the idea of a public persona that is created in other people 's minds, and you have to admire him for his zero-fucks-given attitude. He also refrains from ventilating gossip or attacking people who wronged him, and some parts of the text suggest how Grohl tends to overcome setbacks: E.g., his infamous phase of drinking and depression after Kurt 's passing is mostly turned into a kind of rebirth, an episode in which he decided to take a new leap - which certainly is not wrong, but you could probably frame the whole thing very differently. But Grohl did not - and his determination is probably key to his achievements. This memoir mostly remains upbeat, intending to inspire, and there 's nothing wrong with it, but it also means that aspects like the difficult dynamics in Nirvana remain enigmatic and key personal turning points like Grohl 's divorce are hardly mentioned. Did this take away from my enjoyment of the book? Not at all.  This guy is a rock'n'roll unicorn, and I could listen to him for days.  2 book reviews: Kudos to Dave Grohl for keeping it classy and crafting a memoir that exudes his appreciation for the musical life he s lived without resorting to titillating gossip and scandalous revelations.  The Storyteller is a collection of the Foo Fighters front man s reminiscences that will delight music lovers, Gen-Xers, and readers who just love honest self portraits written with eloquence. Even as someone with a pretty neutral take on the guy, I hung on every word. I picked the book up not because I love Nirvana or Grohl or grunge, but because it s said to be a great read. And I m here to confirm  it is.  Don t expect to learn new details about Kurt Cobain s death or anything tawdry like that. Do expect to listen to how much Dave Grohl loves his mom, being a dad, playing onstage with friends and famous rockers, and just generally living life. The storyteller, indeed.  4.5 stars  Blog:  3 book reviews: I miss Taylor Hawkins. I figured reading this would be the next best thing to hanging with Dave during this sad time. It felt like sitting down in a bar with him while he shared random stories from his life. He s certainly a born storyteller and I found this a captivating read. It was refreshingly different from the usual rock bios. I even loved the way it was laid out; from the chapters and titles, to the inclusion of black and white photos and postcards scattered among the pages.  Dave s story is inspiring, and will no doubt motivate many musicians or those pursuing anything creative.    I didn t expect the Law of Attraction and manifestation to feature so prominently.    Being a fellow drummer and music nerd, resonated on many levels. Dave 's love for music is the heart of the book, and how it helped shape his identity and journey through life. He s the ultimate music fan, and the book is filled with countless anecdotes and stories of him meeting his idols. In fact, you could argue he neglects his personal life (mention of wife, and exploring more heavy issues in-depth) in favour of  the time I met..    but it helps when the stories feature my favourite musicians and he writes so well.  My favourite parts of the book involved Dave talking drums and his career; particularly his early days touring in vans, joining Nirvana and forming Foo Fighters. I loved how fondly Dave spoke of Australia and was surprised at the unexpected supernatural twists that stories occasionally took. His dedication to  the show must go on  despite various hurdles and catastrophic injuries was admirable and blew my mind. The way Dave lives life itself is inspiring and you can t help but want to take life by the scruff of the neck after reading.    Reading of his grief upon losing Kurt made me hurt too.    And I couldn t help thinking of how Dave s doing since losing Taylor. One of the nicest parts of reading (besides the overflowing love he has for his amazing Mum) was that Taylor Hawkins was very much alive in the pages of the book.    I couldn t put this book down and didn t want it to end. I hope it 's not the last we see of Dave 's writing. An impressive collection of stories and  amoments' from a man who has achieved so much in life.   4 book reviews: Grohl 's prose is surprisingly effective. If this was written without a ghostwriter, it 's an admirable effort. However, I found the overall work to be a bit scattered and shallow. Grohl jumps back and forth through time a bit too often, and grants entire chapters to episodes of questionable interest. I would have appreciated a bit more of a deep dive into some of the things that have made Grohl 's life so special; his jump from high school student to international touring drummer of the band Scream seemed so abrupt that I almost felt I had skipped a chapter.  In one moment, Grohl is talking about his first girlfriend. Then, it seemed, in the next, he was playing a show with Scream in the Netherlands. How did such a jump change a teenager? How did this new perspective alter his worldview, cause him to grow as a human being? These sorts of engaging questions are abandoned for amusing, though ultimately disposable anecdotes about being chased through European alleyways by junkies and skinheads. This issue is exacerbated by Grohl 's questionable inclusion of chapters on seemingly disposable events, such as being hit in the head as a child and the claims that Grohl does not feel physical pain.  The Nirvana chapters are also comparatively light. Grohl and Cobain lived together in the pacific Northwest during their time in Nirvana, but very little of Cobain is shared beyond what everyone already knows: that he was a brilliant songwriter, that he was a depressive, that he was staunchly anti-establishment. So desperate for Cobain crumbs was I that I found Grohl 's mention of Cobain 's endless love of strawberry milk to be one of my favorite tidbits in the book.  Too much of this reads as a surface-level description of Grohl 's life, and the man although undoubtedly having lived an incredibly interesting, eventful life seems to lack the insight as to what, exactly, makes his life so incredible and eventful. Thus we are regaled with pitter-patter, here-and-there stories which seem scattershot and do not dive into any real meaning or cohesive theme which drives Grohl 's experience, and seem more instead like a smattering of unrelated tidbits from an old-but-gold rocker. Which is fine, if that 's what you are looking for. But Grohl has been there for such monumental events in recent music history that I would hoped for a bit more.  Foo Fighters and Grohl fans will undoubtedly enjoy this, but those of us on the outside of those descriptors will likely be left wanting more. A solid effort nonetheless, but there 's nothing profound to be had here.  5 book reviews: If you listen to this, (and you must listen to it) make sure you keep listening after the credits.  This is a phenomenal, inspiring book, that brought me to tears several times. Dave Grohl is an energetic, committed, hardworking mofo that loves his mom.  If you re a fan, you ll love him even more, if you re not, let this serve as a primer on how to never give up.  All the stars!  *Thanks to my local library for the free audio download. Libraries RULE! *  6 book reviews: The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music Dave Grohl (Author/Narrator)  After reading reviews I knew I wanted to listen to Dave Grohl tell his stories. He does a fantastic job and if he ever had more free time, he could make a career out of narrating. Yes, I know, he 's way too busy with his other career.  Decades ago I attended a Gladys Knight and the Pips concert and a ZZ Top concert. I was so out of my element at both due to a problem with noises and crowds. Still I was interested in music and was surprised by how many of the people that Grohl mentions in his book that I was at least a little familiar with. But I did not really need to know all these people. Grohl is a fantastic storyteller and I enjoyed listening to his voice and his stories. A lot of the stories had me searching for names and events so I could refresh my memory or learn more about people, places, and happenings. This was an enjoyable listen and it even took me down some long forgotten memories of my own.  First published October 5, 2021  7 book reviews: If you don t love Dave Grohl, there s something wrong with you 8 book reviews: Mr Dave Grohl is most certainly a Storyteller, and each story he shares is a journey through music history. Captivating from start to finish.  He describes his childhood and teen years in Virginia, where he first learnt to play the drums with only one lesson, practicing with pillows and keeping rhythm with his teeth! He shares his decision to leave school and follow his dreams to join the punk rock band Scream in the late 80s. Then joining Nirvana in the early 90s and being catapulted to mega stardom after the success of single  Smells Like Teen Spirit  and the album Nevermind. He also goes into the eventual collapse of the band after the death of Kurt Cobain, and how he coped with that tragedy. It s important to note this book is not a part bio on Nirvana nor is any  dirt  spilled. So if you re looking for that this may not be the one for you.  There is of course, plenty on the Foo Fighters and all the crazy adventures from some of their tours over the years. Including a chapter about a tour in Australia for Big Day Out on the Gold Coast in 2000 which resulted in a drunk driving arrest (which I remember was all over the news down here) lol  There are stories of fatherhood and the love and pride he has for his daughters. He shares special moments meeting his idols, Paul McCartney, AC/DC and Little Richard to name a few.  Overall, The Storyteller is funny, honest and full of amazing personal stories from an incredibly talented, down to earth, wonderful man who has created music that is loved by millions around the world.  I will leave you with these beautiful words he had to say about Kurt Cobain and his friend Jimmy Swanson (also passed).     9 book reviews: Contrary to every second reviewer so far, I m not the Foo Fighters' #1 fan, nor am I obsessed with Dave Grohl. I remain a product of my generation, however, and Grohl has been in my life for the last 30 years; when I stumbled upon this book by chance, this fall, a mere two weeks after it came out, I picked it up on the spot.  I m glad I did. This reads like an extensive road trip in the best possible company for a Gen Xer. Loved the tour anecdotes. Loved the humble beginnings and the candid life lessons, sinking in one by one and retold with the advantage of a more worldly perspective, decades after. Loved the portrait of the artist as a family man, too.  Worship doesn t come easily to me, but respect sometimes develops over time   for certain authentic bands and people. Grohl definitely sealed the deal with this publication.  Maybe I will buy the t-shirt, one day.  10 book reviews: 5 Stars  My biography/memoir \"disclaimer\" spiel: This rating is not a review or judgment of the subject 's life, struggles, or journey. It s just a reflection on how much I enjoyed the book as a reading experience.  I love biographies/memoirs about musicians and have read some really good ones that made me love the artist even more...but I have also read a couple that turned me off so much, it tainted their previously loved music for me. Which is silly, but it is what it is...Regardless, it definitely makes me go into each biography with a small sense of trepidation now.  And this one was huge. Because, like many, I was a child of the 90 's, I LOVED Nirvana, and I vividly remember when Kurt Cobain died. I also went on to love the Foo Fighters and just have a lot of respect for Dave Grohl as a musician. I will never forget his Grammy award acceptance speech in 2012:    I just loved everything about what he said.  So, as I said, I was nervous about reading this and it tainting Nirvana, Foo, and DG for me.  But I should have trusted in the Dave.  What an amazing human being. He just seems like such a great guy and I loved that he narrated this himself (thus my choice to consume this one via audio book).  He manages to talk about people with whom his had issue or who had demons and struggles without any negativity or judgment. And that 's really a special skill and says a lot about him as person. I also really liked how this was not a strict chronological accounting of his life and experiences, but a collection of stories that showed rather than told.  That said, I enjoyed this immensely.  11 book reviews: Dave Grohl might be THE nicest guy in rock  n  roll. He knows his career as a musician is enviable, he knows he makes great music, and he knows that everyone, even the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, wants to be his friend. Yet in his book of stories, the aptly named, The Storyteller, Grohl is nothing but humble and grateful for his family, his friends, and his music.  Grohl talks of his modest upbringing in Virginia and the years he spent roughing it on the road with Scream. Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures   no band is missed. And most endearingly, he makes sure we know how much he loves his mom, his wife, and his three daughters. This man will literally fly across the world and back for those who mean the most to him.  Grohl s stories are touching and hilarious. Some are jaw-dropping. A few are also tinged with sadness for the reader, seeing as he wrote prior to the passing of Foo Fighters drummer, Taylor Hawkins, who he more than once refers to as his  best friend  and  brother from another mother.  Oh, Dave    If you enjoy audiobooks, by all means allow Grohl to share these stories with you himself. After listening to his gentle voice in my ear for nearly a week, I miss him, now that I ve heard the last of his tales.  And like Sir Paul, I want to be Dave s friend, too.  Can I, Dave? Please?  12 book reviews: Finally finished this amazing audiobook. My husband and I were listening to it in the car, and it seemed like for months we were either with other people or not going anywhere far enough away to put in the time. Well, today was the day that we took a long trip and were able to get it finished.  Over the years I have grown in appreciation for Dave Grohl 's musicianship and his dedication to music. This book is just thoroughly delightful, because it is him telling stories about his life--from growing up outside of Washington DC (funny aside: he and I have the exact same birthday so I could totally relate to so much of what he was talking about during the years when he was growing up.  He is also a tried and true music fan. He loves a wide variety of music and those who create it, and is just as much in awe of people like Paul McCartney as the rest of us would be. He does not take anything he has done or experienced in his life for granted, and his love for his family is evident on every page.  His humor is fantastic and it comes across wonderfully in the audiobook. His disdain for Kurt Cobain 's turtle is palpable and made me burst out laughing every time he mentioned it. His experiences with his Seattle \"haunted house\" were equally as funny, and he never ever takes himself too seriously.  Even if you are not a fan of the Foo Fighters or Nirvana (or Queens of the Stone Age, etc), I would venture a guess that you would enjoy this book anyway. Grohl is a true storyteller, and truly a delight to listen to.  13 book reviews: A heart-warming, uplifting look back at some of the highs and lows of Dave Grohl 's amazing life!  I do not read non-fiction much at all, but when I saw Regina 's review of this, I knew I had to get it on audible! Why? Because it 's Dave Grohl!  I think a lot of people would enjoy this audio even if they did not know of Mr Grohl, but if you are a fan, like I am, then you are in for a treat! I was, and am still a massive Nirvana and Foo Fighters fan, so delighted in hearing his tales and memories of both bands. There is not much on the Nirvana years, but then, unfortunately, he only spent a fraction of his life in that band.  I remember seeing the Foo Fighters at Reading Festival (pronounced Redding) in 2000 (I think) and they absolutely rocked it! But what I remember the most, is that people got really over excited and surged forwards, and Dave kept stopping and asking people to be careful and to help people up. He would not play again until everyone was up and safe.   Although not chronological, covered some really interesting parts of Dave 's life, was very entertaining, without being gossipy and I could just feel his love of music and life! He was a fantastic narrator, his rich voice drawing me in, and I found myself wishing I was his friend! He made me laugh several times and swears just as much as I do ha ha!  I just liked his down to Earth attitude, he came across so humble and thankful for everything he has, and just seems like such a good guy. A family man, he tries hard to be a good son, husband, father and friend. Dave seems such a genuine guy! I had never really thought about why he went from drumming, to being lead singer, and found this part of the book really emotional. I was sad listening to how his friend and bandmate 's suicide made him spiral, but I am so glad that music saved him!  In between listening to this, I obviously binge listened to the Foo Fighter 's greatest hits for about two weeks!  I think I love him even more now, and would honestly listen to anything he narrated, even if he did go off on a little tangent about aliens and ghosts at one point lol  To sum up, this is a must listen for fans of Dave 's bands, but that you might enjoy it also if you just love music! Oh and if you do listen, make sure you listen past the end credits, I only did accidentally, but was treated to one more extra treat of a story!    14 book reviews: I loved listening to Dave Grohl narrate the book. He brought the book to life with his voice. However, I was disappointed in the book. One reason is that although there are a lot of stories none of them go deep. I felt that these were just surface layer stories he would tell to any fan or person he was not close to. He skims over the juiciest parts that fans and readers want to know about...the ups and downs of being in Nirvana, starting the Foo Fighters, his personal life. Another thing that I did not like is the sequence of the story. The timeline jumps around constantly. This was confusing as a listener to the audiobook. I never knew where we were in his life when the stories were taking place.  15 book reviews: Audiobook read by Dave Grohl  ..10 hours and 35 minutes.  I had to stop listening to this *WONDERFUL* audiobook to open my Apple-music-playlist to listen to dozens of songs .   Don t Stop Believin  by Journey ..   Best of You . by Foo Fighters   Stay With Me .(Sam Smith singing)  Led Zeppelin >  Stairway to Heaven   Tom Petty >  Wild Flowers    Photograph  > Ed Sheeran  etc ..  This audiobook was all-encompassing passionately profoundly brilliant!!  with added bonus-gifts to any reader/music lover who takes their own reflective time to  STOP . listen to a few favorite songs >  ..to remember the good and hurtful times - cry - laugh - get in touch with the depths of love in one s own heart  ..  Dave Grohl is not only down-to-earth-cool, real, an artist s hero, human as anyone can be, but he epitomizes the richness of life itself!!             - [ ]  16 book reviews: I loved every minute of this. The audio is a MUST! 17 book reviews: One time drummer of Nirvana and founder and songwriter of the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl, is one of the best-known musicians on the planet. The first thing you learn about him (but most of us fans know this anyway), is that he s generous and a nice bloke. This comes through in spades in this autobiography, it s also evident for those of us who have seen the Foo Fighters live   the only time I saw them, they played for almost three hours. It was the best live show I have ever seen (they played with Tenacious D FFS!   how lucky was that?)   and I ve been to a few concerts over the years. The only bands I reckon I might enjoy more would be ACDC or Radiohead   they re on my bucket list.    In this audiobook, Grohl talks about his humble beginnings, living with his and sister in working-class Springfield, Viriginia. I really enjoyed hearing his early experiences practising drums on pillows, and following local punk bands as he was growing up. Even though he wasn t musically trained, he had enough pluck to put himself out there and, even though he said he benefited from serendipity at times, I truly believe he made his own luck. One can only admire the guy. The way he phoned for an audition to the well-known band Scream, when only a young inexperienced , was admirable, yes   he got the gig, and the rest is history. He doesn t say it   but he had balls, but he 's never cocky.  Learning about his time with Nirvana was interesting, the capricious Kurt Cobain was difficult to work with at times, a junkie   but what an obscene talent. His death had a massive impact on Grohl, despite Cobain s tricky character, he was also a heroin addict   which was a whole different world from Grohl s world of smokes, weed and booze. They seemed to grow apart when Cobain started to down spiral.  Grohl played for a number of bands over this time, often as a guest (see the link to Queens of the Stone Age below   you ll get an idea of Grohl s energetic drumming style).      Then there s this   him playing to the soundtrack of    And just a very short clip of Foo Fighters and Dave Grohl dedicating a song to his best friend, and the Foo 's drummer Taylor Hawkins and Glastonbury.      Magic.  I love this and I was sad to finish it ..   #FF  18 book reviews: 'Though I have never been one to collect \"stuff\", I do collect moments'  With that Dave Grohl takes you on his crazy journey through rock 'n roll from his time as a punk rocker touring in the back of a van in the 80 's to playing sold out stadiums today, and how he was part of a rock revolution in the 90 's. This is not his full biography as there are gaps, but it is his stories that he tells that had a profound impact on him and all the chapters has a lesson in living in them. What I also found endearing is that he is a family man and that he admits that his greatest achievement is his family. His musical journey is a soundtrack of my youth through the bands he played (Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age) and his songs always bring back good memories for me. Highly recommended for fellow rockers.  19 book reviews: I believe what they say that Dave Grohl IS the nicest person in Rock Music. I thoroughly enjoyed his stories, encompassing his youth, career, parents, wife and daughters  his awe in meeting fellow musicians, and his remembrance of Kurt (not a whole lot on Kurt) Dave keeps it classy throughout! I listened to the audio! 20 book reviews: Dave Grohl seems like a very pleasant, well adjusted person. His book was disorganized, superficial and boring.  Kurt Cobain was mentioned as briefly as possible. Courtney Love is not mentioned at all. This probably to avoid lawsuits, but entire years are glossed over.  He writes at length about being a father, but writes nothing about his wife, not even meeting her. At times he seems like a single father doing it all on his own.  The book jumps back and forth through time, basically repeating,  to think this misfit kid from Virginia hit it big and met all his idols, who were amazing  over and over.  He was also corny, with metaphors that should be left on the cutting room floor.  Some of his stories are cute, but the book was not really for me. Sorry Dave.  21 book reviews: So, I ve got to rate this 5 stars. I will lose my honorary grunge badge if I do not.  \\_( )_/   I knew that I would like The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music but I was not expecting to love this book as much as I did.  Back in the 90s, I loved this dude from the years of being in Scream and then . When he started after  's death, I was impressed with that as well. In fact, I am going to their concert this year in Seattle and I ca not wait!    I m sure the printed version is good but to hear talk about his life, his music career and now being a Dad of three girls, it s even better!    As a grunge fan rocking flannel, cut up jeans with paint and bobby pins, and also purple hair back in the 90s, I loved the parts of the book with his days with and how  s suicide really affected him. This was the part of the book that I really wanted to listen too. I can t tell you how many times I listened to and back in the day.  I also lost a best friend in the 90s to suicide and it s tough to go through this at an early age. The questions of \"Why?\", \"Could I have done more?\" and \"What the fuck?!\" don t really go away.  I loved to hear about what music means to him and how he s always trying to be genuine and uniquely himself, even if others don t like it. I love this about him and wish more celebrities and people in general cared less about other s opinions, and cared more about being yourself and happy!     And even if you are not a big fan of music and alternative/rock in general, I don t think you ll be disappointed by this book. It s well put together; the pacing is great and it s extremely entertaining to listen to Dave talk. He 's actually a great narrator!  22 book reviews: Dave Grohl s memoir, The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, was very good. I highly recommend the audiobook, which Dave narrates himself. He is truly a storyteller   I appreciated his humor, animation, and ability to tell both funny, entertainment focused stories and those with more depth that were personal.  I honestly had very little familiarity and knowledge of Dave or The Foo Fighters or Nirvana before reading The Storyteller. Of course I know the classic song  Smells Like Teen Spirit  but wasn t working with much beyond that. I share this to emphasize that you don t need to be a huge fan of the bands to enjoy this book.  Dave grew up in Virginia. He dropped out of high school to join a band, Scream, and traveled the country in a van with his bandmates. Eventually he joined Nirvana and after Kurt Cobain s death, formed The Foo Fighters.  While music is appropriately a huge part of Dave s story, I really enjoyed the stories he shared about his family   His mom being his number one fan, through and through, and his clear commitment to and love for his wife and their 3 daughters.  23 book reviews: \"Music had become my counselor when I needed guidance, my friend when I felt alone, my father when I needed love, my preacher when I needed hope, and my partner when I needed to belong.\" -- page 364  I tend to tread carefully around show-biz memoirs and autobiographies as the celebrity author may start a lot of (or is too many?) sentences with \"I,\" repeatedly mention to the audience how gosh-darn fabulous they are, and/or insufferably name-drop every famous person that they have encountered in their career. Still, I consider Dave Grohl to be one of those guys that is help keeping rock music alive - I was fortunate to catch the Foo Fighters in 2005 at the Spectrum (and may that legendary concert venue rest in peace) in Philadelphia, and I fondly remember that night with the happily loud and fiercely high-energy performance - in these days of its sadly waning worldwide popularity. So is this musician - now 30+ years (!) into his career between two renowned rock bands - any good at penning a book like he is at writing lyrics? . Grohl pleasantly comes across as a somewhat typical suburban native who still loves his idyllic hometown on the outskirts of Washington D.C. as well as his supportive mother, dotes on his three young daughters, and likely awakens in the middle of the night to hug himself with joy that he has gotten to share the stage with rock legends ranging from Paul McCartney to Joan Jett. (Grohl 's sincere love of music is evident throughout the text. He may now be a 'name' act on his own but he absolutely loves to give real compliments to dozens of folks or acts, whether they be obscure or world-famous, who have inspired him throughout his life.) Barring the sections on the passing of Kurt Cobain, this was an often humorous and upbeat self-work from a man who seems genuinely thankful for and still amazed by his various experiences.  24 book reviews: Hard to review this one. I have had it a while, and reviews I have read are either hot or cold. The Foo Fighters played a gig in Christchurch last week, which I attended, torn Achilles in a moon boot and all.  The Foo Fighters are renowned for always delivering at a live performance, and as expected they did not let the crowd down. Having previously seen them in a much (much) smaller venue in around 1998, this was a vastly different experience, but still great (stadium gig). More for my own benefit I have included the setlist below - so I can find it again if I feel the need!                         So to the book.  I read it pretty quickly, and it was not unenjoyable. Dave Grohl is recognised as a nice guy, a grounded guy, a family man. All of this is reinforced over and over in the book.  He is also humble, and deferential to any musician he feels influenced by. There were large sections of the book where we learn the circumstances in which he meets many (many, many) of these musicians all of whom are his biggest influence. It did get a bit repetitive. I have no doubt he really does have a massive circle of friends.  For me one of the best parts of these sorts of bio 's is the gritty stories of how the musician made it. Dave delivers on some of these, providing plenty of background from his time in the bands and then of course , as when he joined they still had no profile.  There were however plenty of anecdotes which were amusing and interesting. It was interesting to learn how he met his band members although it does not spell out all the circumstances in which they come and go. Occasionally the anecdotes are out of sequence, which jarred a little. One minute he refers to his wife, next minute he is in an anecdote about his girlfriend flying out to meet him on tour - not sinister, just jumping out of time sequence...  Did I love this book? No. Did I enjoy reading it? Yes. Did it share lots of unknown things? Probably.  I ca not go below three stars, or above four stars. Arbitrary I guess, at 3.5, rounded down.  If you are a fan, then find a copy and read it your self - YMMV.  25 book reviews: Nirvana was my favourite band when I was 15. I bought Nevermind the day it was released (on cassette!) after reading several rave notices, which referenced The Pixies, Husker Du, Sonic Youth et al. A lot of bands were subject to such (in their cases) overblown press (remember The Vines? The greatest band since Nirvana, according to NME. How about The Music? 'The best new band in Britain') but I was all-in every time, on the off-chance that, this time, it was all true. I went out and bought the album from the one place in the town next to mine that sold music, ran up to my bedroom wondering what all the fuss was about (probably very little; remember Mudhoney? Did they ever pay Iggy Pop royalties?), put the tape in, pressed play and waited.  Pretty soon, everything made sense. I would been waiting for those songs and the wait was over, and I was grateful and overwhelmed. This was the stuff, finally! Once the shock of that melodic battering ram had worn off a little, I started thinking about what made the songs work, why they were so much better than everyone else 's, what the three (!) musicians were doing to create such a thrilling blitz of noise. It seemed so maddeningly simple. Guitar, bass and drums played like the world was about to end. And this the miraculous result. Conclusion: whatever these three men had, they had more of it than anyone else.  The next album was different, but Nevermind was unrepeatable. In Utero was less urgent, more interesting, more sombre. Whatever they had was still in evidence, had been dialled down, was lying in wait. And then it was all over.  I went back to Bleach, an album I would never really warmed to, and which confirmed that only with Dave Grohl in the line-up was the alchemy right. Whatever weird confluence of luck and judgement that had brought the Scream drummer into Nirvana had turned them into the world 's greatest rock act. Those drums drove Cobain and Novoselic to places they would otherwise never have reached. It was a shame it was all done after two albums. There were no other Kurt Cobains to go around.  The NME featured Grohl 's next venture, Foo Fighters, in which it seemed he would be playing lead guitar, not drums. Oh crap, I thought -- this could be like Cast, a dire Las spin-off. Do not besmirch the legacy, Dave! But I was right behind it, desperate for it to be at least . If so, I would just say it was great. Nirvana would live on! Sort of.  I was a little older by now, but the process was still basically the same. Get on the bus, buy the album, take it home, sit with it and see what was what. Though this time, it felt cruel. Nirvana were not coming back. Here was the unquestionably great drummer doing a potentially embarrassing Paul McCartney circa Abbey Road, the only man in the studio, playing all the instruments, everyone else gone and no longer under any illusions.  And yet that Foo Fighters debut pretty great, and those were definitely Grohl drums. It was enough. Many of the songs were clearly, openly about Nirvana, about Kurt Cobain, but the misery, the parlayed dyspepsia had all been spent, distilled and bottled into those two landmark albums. The Foo Fighters were , even when the lead singer was shrieking, even when the song was a sad one. And though they would never be great, they would be good, and they would last, and they would put a smile on your face whenever they came on the radio.  This memoir is funny and excellent company. It 's like a really good Foo Fighters song: too likeably formulaic to hit the heights, but never dull. And the bits about the Nirvana years -- featuring a horrible apartment in which Grohl struggles to sleep on a couch beside Cobain 's pet turtle which taps on its tank throughout the night -- are the best of it.  'These deaths still resonate like a long echo throughout my life, and not a day goes by when I don t think of Kurt and Jimmy. There are simple reminders: A song on the radio that Jimmy would air-drum to while driving his old, beat-up Renault car. The pink strawberry milk that Kurt would sometimes buy at the gas station as a treat for himself. The smell of the cheap Brut cologne that Jimmy would douse himself in each morning, for no one to enjoy but himself. The Elmer Fudd hat that Kurt would often wear to hide his face from the public, and the white-framed Jackie O glasses that became his trademark. It seems that everywhere I turn there is a reminder to be found, and I have come to a place where they no longer break my heart; they make me smile.  But it s when I sit down at a drum set that I feel Kurt the most. It s not often that I play the songs that we played together, but when I sit on that stool, I can still picture him in front of me, wrestling with his guitar as he screamed his lungs raw into the microphone. Just like staring at the sun will burn a spot into your retinas, his image will forever be burned in mine when I look past my drums to the audience before me. He will always be there.'  26 book reviews: Dave Grohl has often been referred to as the nicest man in rock. And he certainly lives up to that title in this memoir - the Foo Fighters frontman makes great company, telling many colourful stories about his time in the music business, but never forgetting where he came from, or the people who helped him along the way.  Grohl was raised in Springfield, Virginia, mostly by his mother, a teacher. He did not really see eye to eye with his Dad, a Republican political consultant. When cousin Tracey introduced Grohl to punk rock at age 13, his eyes were opened, and he knew what he wanted to do with his life. He began to dedicate his free time to learning the drums, and somehow ended up wangling an audition for Scream, one of his favourite bands. He nailed it and even though he was only 17 at the time, was asked to join the group as a full-time member. He toured extensively with Scream, though they remained an underground band, never attaining mainstream popularity. Everything changed when he agreed to join Nirvana, who of course became the biggest music sensation on the planet. Kurt Cobain 's death had a major effect on Grohl, but he eventually pulled himself together to establish the Foo Fighters. This venture has been a huge success, and he spends his days touring the world with the band and raising three daughters with his wife Jordyn.  Grohl comes off as such a likeable guy in the book. He has managed to stay humble somehow, even though he can call Paul McCartney a friend and has performed for Presidents. He 's got some great stories of life on the road, and I think I enjoyed his recollections of Scream the most, even though I knew little about the band. Something about the tireless effort they made, all the crap venues they played, the dirty floors they slept on - it seemed like a magical journey even though they never really made it. He speaks of that time very fondly and I am sure he would not change a thing.  If I have a criticism of the book, it 's what has been left out. It was a bit light on Nirvana for my taste. I know Grohl was not in the band all that long, but I would love to have read a few more Cobain anecdotes or to discover what it was really like to record Nevermind, arguably the most important album of the 90s. He also barely mentions his first marriage, which I found a little odd. Maybe it 's a wound he would rather not pick at, but I would like to hear his whole story, not just the happy memories.  All in all though, it 's a pleasure to read. Grohl is a witty, spirited narrator and it 's no mystery why he has managed to stay at the top for so long - his enthusiasm is infectious. The Storyteller is a fast-paced and entertaining perspective on what it takes to make it in the rock business, and what happens when those dreams come true.  27 book reviews: Really fun and entertaining. It was joyful to read.  Yes the timeline is a bit all over the place but I would not say this is a chronological autobiography. It 's exactly as described, stories. 28 book reviews: Roots are never lost for some, no matter the fame. I would believed I had seen that in Dave Grohl while watching him interact with crowds and fans   sitting from the relative anonymity of my couch instead of a seat in an arena, because as long as I have been a fan of their music I can still only wish that I would seen the Foo Fighters in person. Someday I will. In the beginning of the book, Grohl details the night he broke his leg during the 2015 concert in Sweden. As bad as it was he writes the moments with typical self-deprecating humor. Two songs in, running across the stage, tripping over some cables, falling a dozen feet to the concrete below. He lands upright because hey, maybe he can superman this moment, but no, he really is human. But instead of going to the hospital, he sits on a chair donning a temporary cast to finish the night for the fans. The seeds that were planted in Dave Grohl 's childhood, ones that said,  work hard for it  are mostly credited to his mom. Is humility also born when we are young? I think so. I smiled every time he would say,  How on earth did I get here , or  I ca not believe I just met Paul McCartney... AC/DC... Joan Jett... the President (more than one of them), et cetera. He 's starstruck in each occurrence.  There have been times of uncertainty during his life - decisions to be made: Leaving school for the chance to tour as the drummer with Scream; leaving the same band when it stalled out 3 years later in L.A. to then make a call of destiny to Nirvana; picking himself up after Nirvana 's end; followed by many other instances like the aftereffects of a best friend 's passing. But without saying yes or taking a chance there is no moving forward. And he has continued to move forward (including through much loss since this book 's publication), never without many thank-yous to those in his past and his present. The last pages are filled with this recognition of gratitude to others, including the whys, because the journey was not made alone.  This book would grow two-fold if he had added the thousand other pieces I wanted to know. He started the love for music as a pre-teen, specifically  punk rock , and it all began with the drums. Listen to any Foo Fighters album to hear the drums place in the center. He does not talk about learning the bass and guitar, or the writing of songs, even though the first Foo Fighters album was a solo creation. After that first album, the formation of the band is somewhat skipped. But these are not complaints. I enjoyed the hell out of this book.  29 book reviews: 4 stars  Life is just too damn short to let someone else s opinion steer the wheel,  Dave Grohl is such a talented musician and I ve always thought he seemed like a down to earth guy. Listening to his book was a lot of fun and hearing stories about his music career and family was awesome. Of course the fact that he narrates it makes it all the better. Definitely recommend for music lovers. Audio book source: Libby Story Rating: 4 stars Narrators: Dave Grohl Narration Rating: 5 stars Genre: Memoir Length: 10h 35m  ",
    " The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life": "book reviews: If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.  In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.    So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word \"fuck\" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it 's bright fucking orange.  That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone.  But when I got to this:    I knew this book and I would be friends.  I am SO anti-participation trophy it 's ridiculous. And, no, I do not care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose. That 's how character is built, my friends.  And that 's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually. That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already.  But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.  Do not get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points. Some really good, well articulated ones actually.  I definitely do think this book has something to offer. For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it 's just not gonna happen. And that 's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just are not all THAT.  And that 's okay.  As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies.  It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former \"bangs all the ladies\" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll* It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes.  He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women. Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book.  Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude.  But whatevers.  That 's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.  1 book reviews: Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i do not usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, do not give up, it 's gonna be okay, it 's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they re choosing to find important in life and what they re choosing to find unimportant.  These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:  The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one s negative experience is itself a positive experience.   Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn t necessarily mean they re the same thing. Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that s likely to save the planet one day.  Ironically, this fixation on the positive on what s better, what s superior only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she s happy. She just is.   Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.  The Feedback Loop from Hell  There s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you re so anxious. Now you re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where s the whiskey?  2 book reviews:  Giving too many fucks is bad for you.  The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck ~~ Mark Manson    Where to begin?  Well for starters, is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than . Why? He does not put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He wo not tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out.  And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you.  Oh, let 's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it 's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the .  What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It 's not.  Manson proudly announces he ! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul.  There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can so we need to figure out which ones really matter.  Or how about this gem: \"While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.\" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I ca not help but think of Emerson,  Its the not the Destination, It 's the journey.  Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this .  Most of Manson 's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without ?  Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I will read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just do not give a fuck ...  3 book reviews: Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub/restaurant, enjoying the ambience and possibly a meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, grinning profusely, and then just does not stop talking about his life, your life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons.  Seeing this book for the first time, I will admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with \"The subtle art of not giving a f*ck\" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it.  The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. But, from the words \"Chapter one\" it all took a swift nose dive.  Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of \"Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you\" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, this was kind of tiring. It was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked and it was unnecessary.  There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book contained mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just do not buy it.  For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of things we already know, written by an average male and, I am still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given.  4 book reviews: There are a lot of points in the first half of the book that I agree with: prioritizing fewer things and the right things; defining the right values and what you are willing to struggle for; being addicted to outrage and victimhood to avoid responsibility and acknowledging mistakes; etc. However, the tone is VERY heavy on this edgy dudebro persona that gets tiring easily, especially in the beginning where the author drops the F bomb every other sentence in order to seem  real  and contrarian. The book would probably be most appealing to straight white men, since there are some parts of advice that would not resonate well with other groups - for example, he talks about the entitlement of victimhood and how that prevents positive change, which is true to a certain extent if we were to look at specific places like twitter, but should not be boasted as blanket statements coming from a white man who admits to coming from a wealthy family. The second half of the book is the weakest, as it starts to dwindle with advice on love and relationships and some of the author s hokey philosophy on life and death - these parts were too trite for my tastes and felt like he was trying to halfheartedly wrap up the book in a meaningful way now that we were getting to the end. Ultimately, I am settling on 3 stars because there are still some values that I agree with and will take away from this book (and hope other people will too), but not for some of the others, and certainly not with the author s writing voice.  5 book reviews: I am not actually done yet, but this book is becoming more problematic by the page. In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980 's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with \"in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it\" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.  ***  Finally finished. One star. You do not need to read this book.  6 book reviews: I started out liking this book, I really did. By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book.  7 book reviews: It 's a very surface level look at Stoicism and western Buddhism aimed at dudebros. It has some good things to say, and it 's a decent introduction to some great concepts, but it 's pretty cringe and misogynistic.  I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives.  8 book reviews: What a load of self-indulgent, sexist codswallop. 9 book reviews: Have you ever been in a bar and had a know-it-all tell you everything you need to know about life without any evidence to back up what he 's saying? That 's what this book felt like. 10 book reviews: Definitely written by and for straight, white, entitled males. I have no fucks to give for this book or the author. 11 book reviews: you think you are getting a light, irreverent lifestyle/self-help book, but then it 's actually just a few good ideas taken from Buddhism and then mixed in with conservative nonsense about \"snowflakes,\" mixed with some casual misogyny and backdoor bragging. A book only a white straight man with rich parents could write. 12 book reviews: \"This is something called maturity. It 's nice; you should try it sometimes.\"  There were not any 1 or 2-star rated books on my GR shelves until now. If I find a book is not working out the way I had hoped, I stay away from it, and will not invest any more time. This is the first book to contradict this practice. Based on the hype, I was looking forward to enjoying this book for a very long time. When I finally started, I quickly got the impression that this is not for me. But even with getting do-not-continue warning signs right from the start, I proceeded till the end, hoping something will change my opinion. Well, if I had received any help from this book, that would be with 'not giving a f*ck' about this book, and move on. I even feel like I am being generous giving 2-stars instead of one, but that 's only for the interesting example stories author presented (only the stories, not the author 's opinions) and for the obvious difficulties of life that we all already know.     Starting from the first chapter, I had the vague feeling that I had dived into a Gladwell  'self-help' book. The obvious (and simple) truths about life and circumstances are presented in a very amusing manner, sandwiched between what I felt to be inexperienced conjecture of the author. True, there were a few good parts, and I would even categorized them as helpful, but it felt those truths had been taken out of context to suit to the author 's own views. Initially, I had the impression, may be the book is moving along the lines of the art of letting go, but that also stopped very quickly. According to the author, there 's a line separating what 's worth or not giving attention to, and our principles are only valid based on which side of the line we are at. Even the almost annoying number of 'f*cks' diminished after a few chapters, to proceed along what felt like a very long rant.     I am a Buddhist, and would like to consider myself at least somewhat familiar with Buddhism. As the enlightenment is accepted to be related to letting go of the worldly pleasures according to Buddhism, Manson takes this as an example to justify his opinions. Then, he goes and creates a line, which he thinks is from where the letting-go should be applied to. It 's not that the content are false, but everything 's completely taken out of the original context, and I am failing to see how any of this is supposed to be 'helpful'. One could certainly empathize with everything stated here, and agree to most of it, but that 's pretty much it: I could not find the self-help part (if there was any). If the book 's intention was to make one immune (or resistant) to the difficulties the society put in one 's way (as the name implies), at least for me, it failed spectacularly. After the first few chapters, it often felt like the author contradicting himself with what followed.     Just like with a Gladwell book, I think one should read this book carefully, especially if the reader is new to self-help/ philosophy genres. If you are already familiar with some good/ logical philosophy books, chances are, you will take everything in this with a grain of salt, and only extract what 's helpful. However, when a non-fiction book gets this much popularity, this could even become the very first self-help book one reads. And that 's a dangerous thing, to start along with a system that accepts 'expecting the negative to happen to be a positive thing'. As the experiences/ examples presented are clear, and very easy to relate to, it 's easy to get completely lost in a philosophy like this. I still decided to share some (obvious) wisdom quotes, but I hope you wo not be tempted to read this one because of them. On the contrary, I am only reviewing this one to warn any future readers, especially if you are new to self-help or non-fiction books.   13 book reviews: I do not read self-help. I simply do not believe in the self-help genre. If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.  Since I do not read self-help, you may be asking \"Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I am doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I do not usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help.  Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end. Mark Manson is shallow, smug, and completely uninformed about everything that he was trying to talk about. You know what I do not give a fuck about? This book. DON'T READ IT. AVOID AT ALL COST!  Popsugar 2017 Reading Challenge: Bestseller from a Genre I Do not Normally Read.  14 book reviews: Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author 's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on.  Makes sense.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other \"how to be happy\" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail.  15 book reviews: In a Way, He Has a Point!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ..                      16 book reviews: My, my! What a catchy title!    I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I picked this up. And now that I am done? Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he 's written about is common sense stuff.  Maybe. What does it say about our society in general that of what he 's saying is...well, remotely necessary to !? When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really need to be said.    The gist of this \"groundbreaking\" book is that there 's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it 's not in any way, shape, or form realistic...or healthy. Life will give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we will get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale happily ever After has arrived.    We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy . Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it is not. You will be in love until you are not. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You will be alive until you are dead.   Ok, granted, that does not sound awesome. But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future happiness high, prioritize what means the most to you , and live with a fearless attitude toward the future? Then you are going to be much more content (and yes, ) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they have set in order to achieve a sense of fulfillment. The end.  The book itself is fairly short and Manson 's voice is not terribly annoying.  17 book reviews: Ego driven rantings  Wish I could say I could not give a fu#k about spending  10.99 on this serious heap of rubbish, but yes, i do give a fu#k that this ego driven, talentless author swindled me out of money for a heap of rubbish.  He is probably having a great old laugh at the fact that his mantra `dont try` has resulted in an awful written book, full of cliches, calling reader `dumbass`, referring to us wanting to feel jennifer aniston`s t#ts , and bigging himself up generally. He probably finds it hilarious that a load of suckers, like me , bought it.  The zen in me tells me lesson is learned, do not fall for arresting titles and stop being impressed by introductory chapters referencing Bukowski. Do not make this mistake again!!!  Ah, the money probably brings him little happiness. He probably in dire need of therapy or funds to hire ladies resembling Friends characters or writing classes. All is well with the world and I am happy these are much needed things my contribution can go toward.  All 's ok now. Do not give a fu#k.  18 book reviews: Whenever a young white dude claims to hold some kind of universal truth, he 's usually just talking about himself. And when he 's not talking about himself or his sexual exploits, he 's mansplaining Eastern philosophy and reminding us that the key to happiness is the acceptance of our own death, which is the only thing I am thinking about after finishing this book. 19 book reviews: -         +                  .      .                      .  -                                                                        .  -                                    ..  -                                .  -                            .          .                    .  -                   (   )                 .                    :\"                \"  -                                  .          .  20 book reviews: I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement   what is this going to teach me that I don t already know?  but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...  It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.  I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.  was both personally relevant and entertaining.  Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:      This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.      Disappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.      This book is slowly but surely shifting my world.      That side note is speaking the truth!!!    Taking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.           He s changing my world right now.      I did not even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.      That thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you re special decide not to be.      Damn, I wasn t prepared for to completely change my worldview in such a meaningful way. I will cherish this book for a long time to come.    ,    21 book reviews: Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest   Psychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.    Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I would heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was , , and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, \"Cool, bring it on. I am ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it 's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn.\" After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that the people who like this book have not taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101.      Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word \"fuck\" like a preteen who 's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But is not that what you are doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.    He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying \"That 's stupid,\" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she does not look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking . This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMen    Manson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo 's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I do not fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I will go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.    2 fucks given  22 book reviews: Cum, Doamne, s  fie  un ghid revolu ionar , c nd e vorba de fapt de o sup  re nc lzit ?

In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?  This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you.  Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that would not be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot.  Could not be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier.  Tips: Do not take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.  ----------------------------------------------- : [2016] [212p] [Inspirational] [Conditional Recommendable] -----------------------------------------------    Este es como el anti-heroe de los libros de autoayuda.

Let us analyze whether it differs from other books published with similar ideas.  The Good   This is one of the first books where the author was bold enough to discuss the toxic positivity spread by self-help books and self-help gurus. It will help those trapped in the vicious cycle of toxic positivity.    This is different from the usual self-help books, right from the color of its cover and its title. Due to its presentation and content, this book will stand out and catch a glimpse of the reader in any bookstore.    Some ideas regarding life and future expectations explained by the author will definitely resonate with the readers.            Using the f word will be ok to most of the readers. But in the initial few chapters, the reader is bombarded with too many f words in a patronizing manner that the reader will start getting bored when he sees the f word.    If you are familiar with Zen Buddhism, you will notice that the author is mentioning many Buddhist ideas as his own in a slightly different manner.    Some of the chapters in the latter half of this book seem to be loosely written.      This will be the toughest part to read for some of the readers. Sexual abuse can never be considered a joke. The way the author looks at sexual abuse will make the reader angry if you are a victim or knows someone who is a victim or have treated someone who is a victim. This is the area that makes the author and this book look ludicrous.    The use of  charged language  and a harsh approach to the reader might be acceptable to a certain extent. In some areas, the author crosses the boundary and reaches the bullying territory, especially how he looks at victimhood.   There are so many positives and negatives to this book. Since this is one of the first books that tried to view self-help from a different angle, it will be a good choice for those who want to get a different reading experience.  25 book reviews: A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.  There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what s important and let the rest take care of itself.  I ve been accused of indifference or  living in a bubble  for years because I don t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.  My Muslim friends will sometimes say  Inshallah  which literally translates into  if Allah wills it  or  If God wills it . When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to  screw it  or  I don t care  but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.  I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you re setting yourself up for failure.  Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James  2012 book as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.  A fun and insightful book.  ** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I ca not fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities.   26 book reviews:   DNF at 29%  By the end of chapter 1, I was OD'ing on the word fuck.    as it sounds, my best friend has nothing on this guy here.

It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you re just left with the advice.  I don t normally read self-help books   the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of  self . Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn t have   I ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn t feel he could just come out and say from the start   well, get over yourself, fuck face.  His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life   but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently   that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.  This isn t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular   not least due to various forms of technology   and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we ve known this for ages   have a quick read of Durkheim s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us.  The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem   I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope   but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing.  28 book reviews: 4 stars!     This book was not only about giving no fucks, it was about giving fucks about only the important things. If you are going to read it, I would recommend the audio book.

I find them full of nostalgia that express a classic and innocent feel to her stories. 3 book reviews: If you are not yet familiar with Emily Winfield Martin s books or illustrations, you should become so. Filled with a whimsical and vintage-ethereal artistic style (if that s not a style, it should be), Martin creates a love letter to the child reader and to the possibilities he or she will become.

And wild . . .  And wise.\"  The Wonderful Things You Will Be (2015) by Emily Winfield Martin is the rare picture book that truly has something for everyone. This thoughtful, quiet story imagines all of the things little ones (both babies and bigger kids) will grow up to be including creative and clever as well as brave and bold.  Martin 's rhyming text moves the narrative along with lyrical narration reminiscent of a poem or a lullaby. Although this book is an obvious choice for parents to read with their children, it can also work just as well in a story time program. The text is just a tad too long for a baby story time but I could see toddlers or school age children being drawn in by the bright colors and rhymes.  This picture book also add just the right touch of whimsy with subtle touches including children dressed as animals and other fantastical aspirations. Each page has ample white space for text combined with bright, colorful illustrations. The Wonderful Things You Will Be includes children from a variety of backgrounds as well as boys and girls. It also thoughtfully circumvents many gendered or cultural stereotypes to create sensitive depictions of each child.  The Wonderful Things You Will Be is a subtle, charming picture book sure to appeal to readers of all ages. A joy to read.  (Thanks to Stefani at Caught Read Handed for recommending this one to me!)

Emily Martin 's retro-sweet style walks that perfect line - hipsters think it 's hipster and grandmas think it 's old-fashioned. Extra credit for babies on the endpapers and toddlers in superhero masks. 17 book reviews: Vintage-style illustrations combined with a classically sweet text make this a lovely bedtime story 18 book reviews: I loved the whimsical drawings and sweet loving message. The rhyme scheme varied, which is a personal pet peeve of mine, but otherwise a wonderful love lit book. 19 book reviews: I am in huge danger of dehydrating after reading this. Is this one of the sweetest books ever or has becoming a mother turned me to mush? I just adored this.  What is such a simple concept and a thought that comes into every parent 's mind, Emily Winfield Martin has turned into a celebration of children 's natures and personalities. It is about becoming a parent and that amazing, intense and all-consuming love a parent feels for their child. It makes you wonder about the possibilities and really celebrate that unique unconditional love that you feel towards this little tiny human that has come into your life. I love to wonder what my children will be like as they grow; every parent does!  The illustrations are just beautiful, especially the babies! The whole aesthetic is elegant and bespoke, and I truly marvel at Martin 's creativity. My family and I will treasure this book; it is utterly wonderful. Five stars +.  20 book reviews: I stared at this book for several weeks because it was placed next to my hanging clothes bouquet and changing table.  My parents finally read it to me over the weekend, which was really fun. The author s inspiring message brought my parents to tears. Literally.  The book s excellent illustrations are both whimsical and relatively realistic with diverse depictions of children. Although smudged with MY PARENTS  tears, the watercolor illustrations held up well.  I plan to read this book many more times. My dad also said he would engrave my name on the special flyleaf page once he finds the right pen, he says. Sounds like he s wanting to stall to me, which frankly tests my patience a bit.  21 book reviews: Both the message and illustrations were on point. I am tempted to give this 5 Stars but the whole you can be anything you wanna be and then showing kids dressed as wolves and zebras just kind of freaks me out so I m sticking with 4 Stars. Overall, would recommend and it seems age appropriate for a 3 year old. 22 book reviews: I read this babysitting my friend s toddler and we both greatly enjoyed it. The pictures and messages are lovely. 23 book reviews: I couldn t find the words to say how much I loved this book and the pictures, so I just vomited instead. 24 book reviews: Mieli eil ra tukai, nuostabus Petrausko vertimas :) 25 book reviews: This is a wonderful book with beautiful illustrations! 26 book reviews: \"And then I will look at you And you will look at me And I will love you, Whoever you have grown up to be.\" 27 book reviews: I loved this children s book totally. The illustrations are lovely and have pastel and baby-like colors that are nostalgic that I feel would be quite attractive to a child. The text is rhythmic like a lullaby. And there is a harmony to both the text and the illustrations together. But what is most beautiful is the message of the book itself. It instills a positive attitude in children towards life by first getting them to ponder their birth as a special occasion and emphasizing the uniqueness of their individual selves and what they could bring about to the world while at the same time emphasizing a selfless attitude. I read it as an adult interested in the craft of illustrating children s books, but I got something rather precious from reading it myself. As I got to think about how parents raise their children and have all sorts of anticipations for their futures and caring for them to grow older and prosper, I thought of divine providence on the other hand. Though this idea is not presented at all in the book in any direct or indirect way, but I thought it s nice to receive this sentiment from a children s book. This sort of positive message is what should always be anticipated from a children s book, and I loved this book mostly for its message. It s very nostalgic like floating on a childhood cloud. Great effort! I loved it and wish I could do something similar someday.  28 book reviews: I have started reading a bunch of books that, according to a website, a particular literary agent likes. This is the first of those books I have finished. It 's cute, sweet, and a bit touching. I have read other books very similar to this one. Books like these often seem to be more for the loved ones who read them to a child. I suppose it could inspire a child to dream about what they could be like as they grow. I like it fine. 29 book reviews: I truly love The Wonderful Things You Will Be. It is unlike all the other affirmation books available to children. The wonderful messages are given in a warm. loving and gentle way. A lovely book to read anytime but especially at bedtime. The illustrations are simply glorious. This is a must have picture book. ",
    " They Both Die at the End": "book reviews: I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH. I have been hyping it up for myself since about 2015 and it absolutely did not disappoint!  They Both Die At The End is a fascinating speculative-YA about living vs. dying. It also features a gay Puerto-Rican main character and a bisexual Cuban main character, and I am ALL ABOUT this ownvoices representation.  As always, Adam s writing style is wonderful. His teens always speak like teens   the excessive but totally realistic amount of times Rufus said  mad  really spoke to the New Yorker in me. He excels in striking the correct balance between depth and comedy, and his talent for dark humor REALLY shined in this book. I didn t know it was possible to laugh so much on the last day of two boy s lives, but it happened.  Normally, I m not a big fan of books that have super insignificant characters as an additional perspective, but I think it worked really well for this book. Throughout the novel, there are maybe 10 people additionally to Mateo and Rufus that get at least one chapter in regards to if they are dying or not today. Though I m usually not pleased with this sort of format, it was executed extremely well. It gave us a lot of insight into how DeathCast has affected others, and it was interesting to see how so many of these seemingly unimportant character were connected to the larger part of the story.  I really loved both of our main characters. Mateo is the SMALLEST LIL BEAN, I wanted to protect him with my life. The way his anxiety manifests is very unique, unlike other fictional characters I ve read before, and I enjoyed seeing him conquer his fears and gain control over his intrusive thoughts. Rufus, on the exterior, seem very rough around the edges, but he is actually a very compassionate, selfless individual. I think I particularly fell for Rufus hard because of that contrast between a boy hardened by trauma and a man willing to sacrifice everything for the ones he loves. Mateo and Rufus complement each other in the best way. Individually, they re wonderfully-constructed characters. Together, they re an unstoppable force.  I have to say, this book really transcended the pages for me. I wasn t just concerned about the characters or the storyline, but it forced me to address my own fears regarding death. I ve been facing a lot of severe anxiety related to death as of late, and made it impossible for me to shove those feelings down any longer. It was triggering in that respect for me, but it was more comparable to exposure therapy by compelling me to confront my issues rather than solely creating more anxiety, so ultimately, it was a positive outcome. I think it s for that reason that TBDATE is such a powerful novel; Although Death-Cast doesn t exist and presently we don t have an exact expiration date, the feelings, the questions, the fears, and the rawness highlighted in this novel are all very real.  What I loved about Death Cast was how WELL DEVELOPED the world around it is. There are so many minute details about how society would be changed if we all knew we were going to die that I really appreciated seeing. I swear, I need another 7 sequels of stories set in this world because of how many possibilities there are! The only small issue I had with the novel is that I feel I didn t understand Death-Cast that well. I understood that they can determine the day you will die with a combination of science and medicine and such, but my understanding ends there. I think I would have liked just a few more pages explaining how this totally new sort of technology worked!

But then again, you can t walk out of a Silvera book and not feel something. His are the kind of books that hold you tightly you can feel it three days later. The kind of books that will make you dissolve from your sitting position and lay your head on a pillow, missing someone you ve never met, and feeling like your entire self is one terrible scarlet bruise, throbbing mercilessly. I know people will experience this book in vastly different ways, but I have experienced it in an almost unutterably personal way. I m starting to think that s just the Silvera effect.    Now. Imagine getting a call, at midnight, telling you that you have less than 24 hours to live. Twenty four hours to get through everything that you wanted to do. Twenty four hours to be all the people you were supposed to be before you could become yourself. Twenty four hours to grow out of phases and mindsets before you could learn what to stand up for. Twenty four hours to rewrite the diaries that have, until then, been scribbled in invisible ink. Twenty four hours to make the memories of a lifetime. Twenty four hours to say goodbye.  How unspeakably awful is that? I mean, mortal life is as fragile as the shaft of a feather and we are all just a transient fixture in the inexorable enormity of the universe and one day we must all inevitably succumb to oblivion, void, and nothingness. Everyone knows that. We just don t like to think about it. But imagine knowing beyond that. Imagine knowing exactly what that day is, the terrible equivalent of being trapped in a huge hourglass that threatens, any moment, to suffocate you with sand.  Think of all the many strangers' stories you won t get the chance to make into, the many versions of yourself that you won t become, the many places that you have longed to visit but which you wo not be able to set foot in, the many people that will impact your life but which you wo not get the chance to meet, the many life views that you would have learned and the ones that you would have eventually unlearned. The songs that you won t dance to alone in your kitchen at 3 am, the second movie ticket that you won t get to give to a dear friend, and the books that you won t gush about online for an embarrassingly long stretch of time.  Think also of the happy memories you have deprived yourself of because you lied and said you were busy and the many people you could have had an amazing connection with but you were too afraid to say hello. The many opportunities to reinvent yourself that you have missed out on because you were ambushed by insecurity and paralyzed by fear of failure. Think of the many years that you have wasted on hate and grudges and meaningless conversations and relationships that barely left an indentation on the surface of your life and the many true friendships that you took for granted until it was too late.  Think of the many times you were scared to call other people out or stayed away from controversial topics because your hands shook at the notion of confrontation and your throat closed up at the thought of sticking your neck out for your beliefs, and your heart threatened to burst out of your collarbone at the possibility of losing friends and family and safety for choosing to align yourself with good causes and the many times your head had hit that pillow at night only to be tortured by the nagging thoughts of 'what ifs'.  These are the thoughts that lingered, like lightening, long after I turned the last page. And many others that I cannot possibly bear in comprehensible words. But the one that I keep turning over and over in my head is this: I owe an older version of myself some semblance of a past not a past to outrun but to turn around and embrace. I owe them memories of some kind of happiness, of deep-bone contentment. Like the characters in this book, I don t want to find myself at the finish line, realizing that I ve never run the race.  2 book reviews: 2 1/2 stars. The concept behind this book is fantastic - in an alternate world, a company called Death-Cast calls people to tell them when their last day has arrived so they can say their goodbyes, live in the moment, and tie up any loose ends. Of course, knowing you are going to die is also horrifying, especially if you feel you have not lived your life to the full. An app called Last Friend brings together those who are dying and enables them to find someone to enjoy their last day with.  It sounded like it should be an extremely powerful read, and yet I found that had than and . It 's my least favourite Silvera book to date.  Though there are some sci-fi elements, I would call this a contemporary. No explanation is given as to how Death-Cast knows when people will die, and this kind of is not the point. Instead, the book focuses on the End Day of two teens - Puerto Rican Mateo and Cuban-American Rufus - as they eat food, walk around town, ride on bikes, visit Mateo 's comatose father in the hospital, and sing karaoke. For me, parts of it .  Where Silvera 's other two books had me gripped with emotion, huge chunks of this book were very slow. I also expected it to be deeper than it was. It was kind of a mediocre take on an exhausted message - the old \"carpe diem\", \"live your life to the full\", \"make the most of today\", etc. Because it is driven by its message, many of the conversations feel and, perhaps because of this, I was not sold on the development of \"love\" between Mateo and Rufus. Though, as in Yoon 's , I am always skeptical of one-day love stories.  Interestingly, and on a more positive note, one of my absolute favourite parts of the book also reminded me of Yoon 's . This was the inclusion of random chapters from other characters' perspectives. In between Mateo 's and Rufus 's story, we get a brief glimpse into the lives of many other characters. There 's something about this that I love - the suggestion that no character is throwaway, that even though some characters are not central to the story being told, they all have their own lives and stories going on.  I am sad that I did not like this more than I did. The ending still packs a punch, though, even when knowing what will happen. Looking back over the story, I feel like it has a great premise (which is revealed by the blurb) and a great ending (which is revealed by the title), but the middle chunk that we must read the book to discover lets it down. Very little actually happens that we do not know about before starting the book.  | | | |  3 book reviews: Adam Silvera, what have you done to me!?  ((...continues wailing))    Imagine you are told you have 24-hours to live. What would you want to do with your remaining time?    A lot of people may understandably say, spend that time with loved ones.    But what if they were unavailable to you, then what would you do with your last 24?    You would not want to be alone would you? Curled up with your books...  Okay, maybe YOU would, and maybe I would, but most people would want to go out there, live life, have experiences, but with who?    For Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio these are very real questions. The day is September 5th and they both have received their Death-Cast alerts.  It 's official. Both boys will die within the next 24-hours. Due to unfortunate circumstances, neither of them have loved ones to spend their last day with.    Through the use of a cleverly-imagined social app called, , they connect with one another and thus begins the last adventure of their lives.    To say this book gutted me would be an understatement.    Once I started down the path of Ruf and Mateo 's journey, I could think of nothing else.  I read this, via audio and hardcover, within the course of 24-hours, which seemed fitting considering the subject matter.    Upon completion, I immediately added it to my 'Favorites' shelf, an act I do not take lightly. The emotions that Silvera is able to draw out with this one; it 's exceptional.  I would recommend this to All the stars!!!   4 book reviews: This was not as heartbreaking as I thought it was going to be to be honest! Does that make me cold hearted?? I ca not really explain my reasoning for this, because I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING. I felt like there were times when the book was really pushing the YOLO message, which is a message I am here for, but I also wanted that message to be a little less outright than it was. I really liked how things played out throughout the story and how we see these two boys bond and connect over what they are facing. I loved seeing them grow together and open up to each other. By the end of it you really felt that genuine connection between them. It 's not just that they were under this horrific circumstance, but that they had also found other ways to relate to each other. There were parts that I felt could have been cut, but trust me, I have seen worse. I just felt things were starting to drag at certain points. A major thing that I LOVED about this book is how it got me thinking about DEATH. I know death is not a fun thing to think about, but it really had me thinking about how I would live my life differently if I lived in a world like this. Overall I thought this was a great book and I definitely think it 's worth checking out if it sounds interesting to you.  (BUT ALSO I'M TRASH FOR MORE HAPPY THAN NOT SO READ THAT BOOK FIRST AND THEN READ THIS ONE KBYE.)  5 book reviews: An interesting concept & premise that paves potential for bigger world building (which unfortunately was not explored). I appreciate that this book has emotionally resonated so many people, and that it is centered around queer latinx boys with a healthy and wholesome relationship. I think about all the young boys grappling their sexuality and reading this book and seeing themselves in it, and that means a lot for such a marginalized and underrepresented group.  That being said, the diversity and concept were not enough for me to enjoy the book and ignore its flaws. Rufus and Mateo were predictable tropes, and their didactic conversations lacked chemistry. The side characters and other POVs contributed nothing of value to the story, and instead read like filler put in to make the book longer. The writing was cliche to the point where I cringed a lot, and Rufus s dialect was very unnatural and awkward. The  carpe diem  theme the story tried to convey was trite. The ending and outcome of the characters did not pay off what I think the author was aiming for.  Overall, many things about this story missed the mark for me. I couldn t care for any of the characters; instead I can only care for the book s impact on others who may find it more meaningful.  6 book reviews: Either I m heartless or everyone s emotional.  It was a sad story indeed but I expected to be destroyed and... I was not.  I loved Mateo with everything in me. He was, to put it mildly, the epitome of goodness but had a hard time connecting with Rufus. He was inconsistent at best.  I also loved their instant connection and bond but I was not down with the insta-love. I simply can t wrap my head around the idea that two people can fall head over heels in love with each other after only a few hours of meeting each other. It s just too... nope. Just can t. If they d had a bit more time together, at the very least, I would ve believed it.  I HATED those side character POVs. They just felt nuisance and kept pulling me out of the story. And what s more, they weren t even just a few POVs here and there, they were SO FREQUENT! And almost none of them were connected to either of the boys. Just random people they ve passed by throughout the day. I found it extremely aggravating.  All in all, had I read this before all the frenzy, no doubt I would ve found it a lot more emotional, alas, I did not. It was still a good read and loved the message it was trying to relay.  7 book reviews: i spent this entire book thinking they were not both going to die at the end 8 book reviews: i hope they stay dead 9 book reviews: Yeeeeah.. this was boring. And Mateo was ANNOYING.  That 's pretty much all I have to say lol. 10 book reviews: omg they died 11 book reviews: Maybe more of a 3.5*  This was really good! I found that it did drag a little bit at times, definitely more of a slow going read but it was such an interesting concept and I think it was very well executed. (It 's actually a concept I had thought of for one of my novels, great minds think alike!) 12 book reviews: FULL REVIEW COMING SOON  What I will say for now is: ADAM YOU ARE SO CRUEL, MY HEART CANNOT FORGIVE YOU. The title 'prepares' you for the end, but that does not lessen the pain one bit. I sobbed the hardest I ever have while reading a book...   13 book reviews: If Jake Paul ever sat down to write a touching story where he can appear deep and woke all at the same time, I feel like this would be that book  The writing was clunky at best and downright cringe at worst. It was chalk full of unnecessary details, and the discussions of the death were all repetitive and shallow to the point where I was rolling my eyes. In terms of the characters, there were so many POVs and all of them were 2-Dimensional and the reason I think of as to why they all exist is to build this futuristic type world where everyone is in an exestential crisis. But every reason this story exists is so contrived that I ca not connect  The two main characters had no chemistry and I probably should have known that instalove would have been a trope that would be used. I was a fool for believing otherwise  14 book reviews:  for those who need a reminder to make every day count.   from the moment i read the dedication, i knew this story would be a meaningful one. adam silvera took a heartbreaking moment and turned it into pure poetry. this book is proof that there can be beauty in the unplanned and that its sometimes the unexpected which makes life worth living.   15 book reviews: I should have known from the title that this book would be heartbreaking... 16 book reviews: \"You may be born into family, but you walk into friendships. Some you will discover you should put behind you. Others are worth every risk.\"  Death calls just after midnight. Mateo and Rufus will die today. They don t know each other yet, but their paths will cross on this last day of their lives.  Adam Silvera is one of my favourite YA authors for several reasons. His characters are flawed and relatable. His stories are original and like nothing I ve read before. And even though they re depressing and heart-breaking, their message is an empowering one. There is nothing that I appreciate more than a well written lgbt book by a lgbt author. There are many gay and lesbian, transgender and asexual storytellers out there but we only get to hear a few voices. Which is why I m even more grateful for Shaun David Hutchinson, Benjamin Alire S enz, Alice Oseman, Victoria Schwab and of course Adam Silvera. They speak from experience, which makes it so much easier to connect with them and their stories.  The concept of They Both Die At The End was just as creative as Silvera s debut novel, More Happy Than Not. You can even find the one or other connection between these two books. What I loved most about this book were the many different POV s. We get to see a big variety of characters and what s going on in their heads and hearts. Lidia s might just be my favourite one. While these POV s were brilliant and emotional, I had a hard time connecting with Mateo and Rufus. I was definitely less emotionally involved in this book than in the previous two. The plot took a while to pick up and I believe that Adam Silvera could have made more out of this fantastic concept. The execution was too grey and unexciting for my taste. Now if you don t want to see spoilers better skip this paragraph. The romance part was a let-down. I was waiting for Rufus and Mateo to fall in love and when it finally happened, it was seriously underwhelming. There was no build-up of (romantic) feelings, and as I said before, what happened hardly stirred up my emotions. The kiss came out of nowhere and left me cold. It didn t feel real or believable to me. At this point I rather they would have stayed friends   there are far too few platonic relationships between gay characters out there anyway.  I m super critical, I know. That s because I m comparing Adam Silvera to Adam Silvera, and the standard he set with his previous novels is extremely high. Which is why I am a little disappointed in this book. For me it lacked in emotional depth. However, I still hope that this will finally get Adam on the NYT bestseller list. He totally earned it.   17 book reviews:  Maybe it 's better to have gotten it right and been happy for one day instead of living a lifetime of wrongs.   This is a masterpiece of speculative fiction. Speculative fiction, to me, is meant for emotions, and meant for exploration and discovery. This book is a story of a last chance and a last day for two very different people, but it 's a story that 's best observed personally - this story asks you to reinvent yourself every single day.  The strength of this book is that somehow, everything here feels so and personal. The amount of side point of views here is perhaps the best part of this book - it 's hard to ignore how personal this story is when you feel as if you could be dropped into the book at any time.  Emotionally, this story is . The characters are lovely and well-developed. And as an added bonus, the diversity is fantastic - Mateo is Puerto Rican and queer, while Rufus is Cuban-American and bisexual.  Let s talk characters, because hey, this is a character-driven book primarily.   Mateo Torrez: Mateo is a homebody and a bit of a nervous wreck trying to have one final day.   Rufus Emeterio: The fact that he put down  Professional Time Waster  as his job in his deathday profile is all you need to know, honestly. In contrast to Mateo, Rufus has accepted his fate. Oh, and he 's also hilarious.  What 's odd about this is the romance plotline is this book comes sort of out of nowhere, but I loved it anyway? Mateo and Rufus do not have a meet-cute. They do not have sexual tension for the first eight hours before they kiss. And you know what? I think the lack of slow burn is perfect. It works very well as a desperate, last-ditch relationship, between two characters who are not in love yet. But they could be.  Basically, this book was worth the hype and Adam Silvera can go fuck himself for writing it. This buddyread with was an absolute success.  | | |  18 book reviews: Do not let the title fool you. This is not a book about death, but about life. It 's about becoming the person you want to be without fear holding you back. It makes you face your own mortality head on and asks the question, if you knew today was your last day would you be happy with the life you lived? This is truly a book you come out of a different person then you went in. 19 book reviews:  Mateo, I regret to inform you that sometime in the next twenty-four hours you ll be meeting an untimely death. And while there isn t anything we can do to suspend that, you still have a chance to live.   Imagine a stranger calls you in the middle of the night and tells you those exact words. Did you end up in a horror movie? Nope. You re in the future and by now technology is so advanced that people are informed when they are going to die. But of course there s a catch. They inform you 24 hours before you die and they neither know how it s going to happen nor when. A car crash, an elevator, an explosion, choking on food? In three hours, right now when you receive the call, 23 hours and 59 minutes from the moment you ve been called? Everything is possible.    So what are you supposed to do? Try to fight it? Stay at home and hope you re safe there? Go out and live your last day to the fullest? Deny it or rather use the chance to say goodbye to your loved ones? It s up to you but whatever you do, is never wrong and sooner or later death will find and claim you. It doesn t matter if you re 90 or 5. A mother, father, child, husband, aunt, best friend or a celebrity, death doesn t care about those things, it makes no difference.    Mateo and Rufus both received the call and neither of them is able to say goodbye to their loved ones. Rufus made a mistake that caused his friends to be  unavailable  and Mateo s father is in a coma and won t even notice when his son dies. Thankfully there s an app for situations like that (I just loved this! I mean nowadays there s an app for everything, right? *lol*) and our two boys meet over  Last Friend . They are both going to die and they decide to spend their last day together     And here is the moment when I m finally going to talk about those two young and sweet boys that only have one day left to do whatever they feel like doing. This book really made me think and it certainly caused me to feel. I could relate to their struggle so much and a little part of me broke when Mateo threw his books across the room knowing full well that it wouldn t matter if they got ripped or destroyed because in a few hours he wouldn t be there to care about it. There were so many little moments that ripped my heart out. T_T Mateo singing for his dad who couldn t hear him, Rufus hoping the Plutos would show up, Mateo taking care of his best friend s kid so she could have a few moments to herself, Rufus thinking that Mateo is pure      What Mateo and Rufus have at the end of their lives is so special! They get to know each other in a way not many people are able to. They speak about the important things, they don t shy away from difficult topics and they get involved with each other. Without prejudices, without a second thought! But would they have been so open if it wouldn t have been their last day? I doubt it. There are things you re too scared to say, things you don t even dare to think about, but what if the only person that s holding you back is actually yourself?    I loved that Rufus helped Mateo to find himself and I adored the way Mateo was able to get under Rufus s skin. What if they would have been given more time together? How much they could have achieved and done; how good they could have lived! It s just so unfair! Or at least it seems to be like that because if there is one thing you can say about death, then it s that it s actually fair. It makes no difference between young or old, married or single, famous or not, good or bad, sick or healthy, queer or straight, happy or unhappy. It s just death and it   well, it happens. Sooner or later we all have to go. We re born and we die, whatever happens in the middle is up to us.      I guess you can already tell that this book made me think really hard. To be honest I never stopped thinking about it and I m pretty sure this is one of those books that will stay with me for quite a while. Adam Silvera painted a vivid picture of a world in which we all know when it s time to go. Whether this is good or bad is up for discussion and we readers are encouraged to give it some serious thought. The different POVs only add to that thought process and the way all those lives are connected and interwoven gives the reader a profound sense of life and its scope as well as its associated mechanisms. Or in other words: It s like with the figuratively pebble that s thrown in the pond. An infinitesimal action has huge consequences.  I won t tell you how this ends because you know, but I will admit that close to the ending my thoughts were all over the place and I found myself yelling:  Oh, sh**! It can t be!!!  All told this was a great book that no doubt, will leave its mark.     ____________________________  This book was already on and I think it s about time to read it! Better late than never, right? ;-)  Also I m still holding out hope that the title doesn t give away the entire plot. I mean they can t both die at the end, this would be so sad! T_T But then again this is a Silvera book and he loves nothing more than to make us suffer so there s at least an 85% chance that the book delivers what the title promises.  Guess the only way to find out is to read it. So here I go! I hope my heart won t be broken into thousand little pieces in the end! XD  20 book reviews: \"Maybe it 's better to have gotten it right and been happy for one day instead of living a lifetime of wrongs.\"  This was my first ever Adam Silvera book, and I would been warned by so many people to prepare myself for ALL OF THE FEELS, but nobody could have really made me understand just how fast and hard I would fall in love with Adam 's writing voice. This book made him an auto-buy author literally by the 25% mark, and I do not think any author has made my auto-buy list so fast in my life.   Imagine a world where someone has perfected the ability to predict when someone is going to die. Now, imagine that same world involving a call center whose staff 's entire purpose is to call each unlucky soul between midnight and 3am and to inform them that this is their End Day. Now, imagine that some kind soul has created an app, much like a dating service, that allows people to find someone to spend their End Day with so they do not have to face it alone.  Mateo has spent his entire life living inside a bubble; meanwhile, Rufus' bubble was burst when his entire family died right before his eyes. The two teens are vastly different, but when they find that they share an End Day, they decide to spend their final hours together, and show one another what living is all about.   Mateo is this adorable, precious little thing who is just terrified of the entire world around him and I just spent so much of the book feeling sorry for him because he is filled with such an immense amount of regret when he gets his phone call. He 's spent his short life too afraid to get out and live, and now that he 's got less than 24 hours until the end, it 's all he wants to do. He just broke my heart so many times.  Rufus, on the other hand, has gotten out and lived, but he 's got his skeletons, too. Despite his own fears and regrets, though, he 's solidly determined to make this last day of Mateo 's life meaningful, even though they only met today. He 's got a heart of absolute gold and I adored the chapters from his perspective. He 's got such a fun narrating voice, and the way he viewed Mateo as this pure, innocent soul gave me !   I expected this book to wreck me, and it did, but not in the ways that I expected. I ca not say much, because the title spoils enough of the book, and this is one of those stories that you are better off going into with as little information as possible. Let me just tell you to have a box of tissues on standby, and probably also some chocolate or ice cream or something, and maybe a puppy to hold if you can spare one?   I had literally not a single complaint about this book. It is so rare that a story is a pure, unadulterated 5-star read for me, but this one achieved that. I would recommend anyone and everyone to pick up a copy of . Even if you do not like YA contemporary, or do not like sad stories... get this one. It 's absolutely worth your time.   21 book reviews: The best way I can describe this is The Sun is Also a Star meets Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. 22 book reviews: Claramente este libro no fue para m .

This book? No, my damn precious little piece of heaven.  I feel so  wouldrugged' at the moment after having absorbed each and every word this book had to offer me. (Ok, as for the time being just calling it as a book is easier and short instead of  amy damn precious little piece of heaven'  )  Of course, this book is not perfect but yes, it has put me under its spell this whole time. (I still cannot believe it made me not to watch Xmen  )   I love how human this book turned out to be! One of the young adult fiction done right. No, this book ai not perfect. There are seemingly character development flaws, weak parts in the writing and some unwelcomed characters. Let 's call this one a perfect read for someone who finds the main characters a little too relatable.  I just love the writing style and I am sure I will read the other books by this author (except the latest book of a series, of course). The writing is straightforward and reach you the moment you set your eyes on it  More than the slow burn romance, I was rooting for the found family dynamics, as well as the best friendships you will ever read about. Character representation is well etched out.  Sometimes the story seems a little too convenient. But it 's okay. (I felt so hungry now and then while reading this book while the two main characters just kept on having adventure after adventure without eating and sleeping much.) Ok, I can tell they were having the best times of their lives and they were not caring about everything else as much as we muggles do. And as much as I was invested in the book, I did fall asleep twice while reading it because I am a muggle and a sleepy mundie which I cannot help becoming. I was so worried about them that it got exhausting in between. Damn, all the uncertainties and the unpredictability in fiction.  I woke up. I continued reading it, I kept crying here and there, I kept blushing (actually shouted 'FINALLY!' and Rufus did the same! I was not expecting a fictional character to shout out the exact same word as I did!) and yes, I was more calm and happier towards the end of the book.  Did I say the characters lacked development? No, not the main characters. They are so wholesome.  In fact, the whole story is wholesome. It spoke in volumes about life and unavoidable situations. It seems so real. The story started with a plot built on something like a dystopian sci-fi (yes, I actually felt this way when I started reading the book). Eventually the good parts took over and I felt so connected with everything that 's happening there.  Some may feel the lines come out a bit cheesy when it comes to Rufus and Mateo (I ship them so much!) but they talked about things that matter and they were as exactly who they were meant to be. Young adult done right, I repeat.   *One misconception about this book:  You must have heard everyone talking about how sad this book is and it will break your heart. Yes, it 's sad I am not denying it. But this book will not break you. I have read books dealing with sensitive, heavy themes which totally broke me aka A Little Life, The Kiterunner to take a few example. But this read is more like wholesome and hopeful like some books dealing with similar sensitive issues aka Aristotle and Dante Discover The Secrets of Universe, I Wish You All The Best.  But of course, you will cry   . . . .  Until the last chapter happened.   Forget everything I said! I cried buckets and buckets!  The ending....is.... devastating. Save me. Please.  24 book reviews: I was not a huge fan of Silvera 's More Happy Than Not so I assumed I was not going to like this one either. I was not even going to bother with this one. But seeing all the heartbreaking reviews from my friends had me intrigued, as well as that title and synopsis.  It 's honestly the best decision I have made in a long time?? Lmao.  I was promised tears, heartbreak and all the emotional feels and it 's safe to say that, yes, I did get all those things. And I ca not be any more happy. It 's no surprise I love sad, heartbreaking books and reading this one really really destroyed me in the best way possible.  When a book makes you cry 3 chapters in, write down my words son, it 's going to wreck you in the best way possible. I just loved this so much, I want to buy a copy for each and every person then throw the book in their face and scream at them to read this!!  Imagine sitting down, reading your favorite book while sipping your coffee or trying to be that perfect grade A student doing nothing but studying all day and not having any fun in your life when suddenly!!!!! you get a call saying you will die in the next 24 hours and that 's all the time you have to do whatever you want (except bad illegal things). Then,  That 's what happened to Mateo and Rufus. They got called by Death Cast and were told that they only had 24 hours to live that day and they should enjoy their last day on Earth.  It 's just so cruel and torturous knowing you will die and not being able to do anything about it except spend the time you have left with the people you love and doing things you would have denied yourself if it were any other ordinary day. It 's especially cruel, knowing you have an exact, certain amount of time left and you have to do this and this and this before you go.  It 's especially cruel having to tell those you love that you are dying and watching them break down in front of you knowing the loneliness, sadness, but memories of happiness you will leave with them.  This is what happened to Mateo and Rufus.  But they found a friend, something more in each other. They did not mope around about their deaths, cry about it, sit silently about it. They found each other and wanted to spend their last day together finding friendships, love and trying new things. They spent their last day with all their loved ones doing things that made them happy. Doing things they never had the balls to do.    It 's impossible to cry when reading something like this.  Like I ca not stress how much this book made realize that I am pretty much just in this world living, no not living, just when I could be doing so much more.  oh no the tEARS ARE BACK.  Mateo is gay and Rufus is bisexual coming from Cuban and Puerto Rican backgrounds. Learning about their families, lives and situations made me want to wrap these two in warm blankets, feeding them chocolate chip cookies and never let them go. They are the sweetest cinnamon rolls to ever exist omg!!  The side characters are literally the most loving and sweetest people to bless this book. Except for that guy whose name starts with a P. He, he can choke. Rufus' two friends aka The Pluto 's are so loving, loyal, caring and sweet!!!! They are more like family and always got each other 's backs and I loved reading about how they are always there to love and support each other!!  My only complaint with this book was that it really dragged in the middle leaving me bored, which is why 4.5 stars.  But like, overall, you guys do not know how much you this book in your life. For me, this book is literally the world and I really hope it 's the same for you.   Bitch, I better die at the end of this book because of them feels.  25 book reviews: \"No matter how we choose to live, we both die at the end.\"  This was wonderful! My first Silvera novel, but it definitely wo not be my last. Mateo and Rufus both get a call from Deathcast that today is their last day on earth - in twelve hours, they will both be dead. Last Friend is an app created for Deckers (people who have received the Deathcast call) to meet up and spend their final hours on Earth with a stranger. Mateo and Rufus meet via this app and decide to have the best last day together that they can. From here we watch as their relationship grows from awkward strangers, to closer acquaintances and eventually best friends. They learn to face their fears, challenge each other and support one another through their final day. From cheesy memory making, to overcoming anxieties and self consciousness to actually running for their lives and surviving numerous dangers. But ultimately, their time is running out, and they ca not run forever. Beautiful, heart-breaking and honest. I loved meeting Rufus and Mateo and seeing them grow as people. This book raises some powerful questions on fate, and whether our lives (and death) are set in stone, or do we have the power to change it, and what it means to truly live. I loved this book and it brought tears to my eyes.     4.5    26 book reviews: My first Adam Silvera book and also an ARC  I did not hate this book but there is not anything that I like either. The chapters are short so that makes for an easy read.  Most of the time I am just bored out of my mind. The romance is unrealistic. What do Matteo and Rufus even see in each other? Its a great friendship yes but romance I do not think so. The romance part is so overdone and unnecessary.  Matteo and Rufus both receive an alert informing them they are dying. They met each other on a chance encounter in the Last Friends app. From there they go for play date after play date or play stupid Traveller games or exchanging their life wisdom which are uninspiring btw. Last day to enjoy before they die.  The whole book is so incredibly childish. I did not experience any emotional impact at all. Why would I? There is no plot twist, secrets revealed or deep writing to make me truly feel for them in their situation. All they do is play date after play date.  The ending was not bad but it did little to make up for the book. It did not hit me as hard when I do not even care about them or their romance to begin with  27 book reviews: Un libro intenso, pero que se queda a medias.  Al final mueren los dos es un libro bastante conocido, especialmente en los  ltimos tiempos, encontrando un gran hueco en el mercado gracias a la comunidad literaria de TikTok. S , era uno de mis eternos pendientes, pero ver tanto hype de nuevo alrededor de este libro me hizo convencerme para leerlo. Y bueno, quiz  s  era lo que esperaba...  Para mi sorpresa, el universo que crea Adam Silvera es m s que interesante y podr a haberse explotado mucho m s. Ambientado en un futuro no muy lejano, la sociedad vive pendiente de recibir una llamada que les avise de que en las pr ximas 24 horas morir n. Los Fiambres -que as  se llaman quienes reciben la llamada- toman un nuevo peso en su sociedad, convirtiendo sus  ltimas horas de vida en algo sencillo y lleno de experiencias. Hay much simas cosas interesantes que podr an haberse desarrollado para dotarle a la historia de un mayor peso simb lico, pero termina y ndose por el sentimentalismo barato.    Los dos protagonistas, Rufus y Mateo, No voy a negar que durante la primera mitad del libro estaba sumergido en todo lo que me contaban: su situaci n familiar, sus amigos, c mo se enteran de que les quedan pocas horas de vida... Pero Por no mencionar que exceptuando un par de cap tulos, el autor introduce momentos de otros personajes que tienen un total de cero peso en la trama general por el puro placer de rellenar.  Veis? Si esos cap tulos con personajes terciarios hubieran servido para explorar el universo futurista me habr a molado mucho m s, pero no...

    " We Were Liars": "book reviews: Once upon a time there were three bears who lived in a wee house in the woods. Once upon a time there were three billy goats who lived near a bridge. Once upon a time there were three soldiers, tramping together down the roads after the war. Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Once upon a time there were three brothers. No, this is it. This is the variation I want. (fuck you, Holden Caulfield). It was not a terrible book. I have read far worse. It 's just that the writing style sometimes get on my nerves. The sentences are sometimes written fully, and oftentimes it just goes like this out of freaking nowhere. For no freaking. Reason at all. If that 's the kind of thing that bothers you. Then you should probably avoid this book.  The entire book is about a poor-little-rich-girl living with a poor-little-rich-family with the kind of ending that makes you go \"WHAT THE ACTUAL KIND OF M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FUCKERY IS THIS?!\"  It 's not terrible. The \"Liars\" are more \"Talkers,\" and they have almost no relevant role in the book because this book is about a pretentious girl with nothing but and . , they are not witty, they are not cute, they do not give off the sense of closeness and kinship that you get from growing up with someone their entire life. Hell, they are nowhere near kind of interesting.  This is a coming of age, and nothing more. It has the kind of writing style that 's often choppy like this. Commas are sometimes used. And sometimes not. Haphazardly. With no punctuality. No pun intended.  The main character sometimes. Has the tendency to use overwrought, run on metaphors. To describe herself. And her headaches. Such as a helicopter blown by the wind tossed by the torrential rain in the wilds of Alaska felt by a little Eskimo girl during the first whispers of a glacial spring with the scent of violets and hints of lavender in the fields of Grasse.  :       Poor little Cadence Sinclair is wealthy. She is loved. She is one of the Sinclairs, a good-looking \"old-money Democrat\" family, think the Kennedys, without the political aspirations. They have names like Liberty, Taft, and Tipper. They go to Ivy League schools. They have trust funds. They have sired a generation of children, the leader of which is Cadence. Cadence and her crew call themselves The Liars are composed of her cousins Mirren, Johnny, and the outcast \"Healthcliff,\" Indian love interest, Gat.  The Liars supposedly cause trouble. They do not really. They do almost nothing. Cadence herself is sick. She is prone to theatrics, and she is not-so-secretly in love with Gat. She gets headaches. She feels self-pity. She is privileged. She does not realize it.           :            . But then again, I have never been a fan of this type of prose. Needless to say, I do not like e.e. cummings. The writing is so often choppy, haphazardly punctuated. Some situations are false.    That, there, was a description of how she FELT. , until I realized that the guy was fucking bandaging her up afterwards.  The main character has a huge tendency to use She describes her migraines like they were the end of the world, which, I understand to some people they might be, but I just could not take it.  : syndrome. She 's beautiful, but wounded, and \"mysterious\" and revered, just for the sake of her blood alone, for the sake of her family 's name alone. Think about it. If you were a Kennedy, it does not matter if you look like an elephant stepped on your head when you were born. People are still going to love you and worship you and whisper your name with reverence because you are a motherfucking Kennedy. It 's this way with the Sinclairs, only there 's no paparazzi following them around. All of the benefits, and no family curse. But somehow Cadence finds a way to be a  She 's rich. She 's hypocritical about her wealth because she criticizes her own fucking family for being wealthy. She does stupid shit like give things away to random people because she can.  She is spoiled. She takes her wealth for granted.   :  He is Indian-American. Gat Patil. He is the nephew of her aunt 's boyfriend, and they have known each other for years. He is self-aware. Too self-aware in the pretentious way that teenagers can often be, but his character feels authentically teenaged. I liked him. He is accepted into The Liars, but he 's not altogether accepted in the family. Because of his skin color, because of his lack of family money, he feels left out. And I can sympathize with him. Gat is intelligent. Reasonable. Likeable. And I wonder why the fuck he cares about a waste of air like Cadence.  1 book reviews: I went into We Were Liars one cocky son of a biscuit eater, feeling above it all right from page one. I would seen this book talked about so heavily by other bloggers and how some never saw the twist coming or how others totally saw that twist coming. All the while, I was sitting on the sidelines with my shades on, posted up with my arms folded, saying, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot potato.\" That 's not to say I did not want to read this book, because I did. I even had an ARC sitting on my shelf for the longest time, but due to a lot of the hype, I kept putting it off. Plus, I am one of those people who usually can easily figure out a plot twist and I did not want to dive into something where a lot of people already mentioned figuring it out.  But one thing did nag me a little in the back of my mind was that my Bookish Twin, Blythe from , LOVED it. I highly value her opinion when it comes to books, because we almost always agree. So when I happened to get my hands on the audiobook, I thought, \"What the hell? I was supposed to read and review this anyway, right?\" Let me tell you... WHOA.    Anyway, I was feeling very blas  about the first half. It felt like a really random story about a rich, white girl and her white girl problems, crying her white girl tears and I felt myself unsure about what the point of it all was.    And maybe that makes me sound extremely heartless, but I could not relate to the main character (no, I am not even going to tell you her name because I want you to go in blind). But somewhere along the lines, I started to become intrigued with the story because .  Lockhart uses a very odd narration with fragmented sentences and strange descriptions, but I thought it was beautiful and unique. It added a very creepy layer on top the the existing oddness. It makes you question the main character, her account of the incident and the entire book. She 's not very reliable and has the habit to cut off mid-sentence. I am not sure if that was used as a way to distract the reader or if it was to used to make us question her sanity. Maybe a little bit of both. Either way, it worked on me.  As things started to heat up and I reached the cusp of the climax, the narrator 's voice increased in intensity. She began talking faster, became very emotional, then suddenly on the verge of tears!  And I started thinking to myself, OH GOD NO. WHAT IS HAPPENING.    And then IT was revealed and I was all, \"WHAT IS THIS LIFE? I REJECT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ENDING. NOOOOOOO!!!!\"    So, naturally, I had a good cry and needed someone to hold me.    By the end, I was all:    I know this review might not be the most helpful in the world, but it 's true what everyone says about . You should absolutely go in blind, with no expectations and let this book take your feels as it sees fit. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers like Stephanie Kuehn 's or , than this one may be up your alley. I will be here to hold you when you are finish.  ARC was provided by the publisher via .  More reviews and other fantastical things at .  2 book reviews: It 's been awhile since I have so totally hated a book.  I am surprised at how varied the feelings on here about this book are...some of my friends hated it.  Some of them liked/loved it.  I still love them....  Let 's get to why I hated this so very frigging much.   The main character is a twit...but then the whole family is:      That 's actually the good part on her family. In some parts of the book the author tries and make the character act like she has redeeming qualifications-but then a short few pages later I just want to smash her again.   The writing style: Good grief..I thought it was only going to last for a few pages. NOOOOOOO, almost the whole frigging book is written like this....         Then that lovely twist of an ending: I am probably going to hell for this but do not click if you gonna whine...    There 's one part I never did figure out. Cady the main character keeps talking about bleeding..Did she cut or was that just supposed to be a metaphor or some crap?   Now after reading this crap I need:   And lastly..for the trolls and fangirls and gif haters (should have thrown that one in) that will come....GO suck monkey ass..this book sucks!  3 book reviews: well this was all kinds of pointless and also depressing. ugh!  the writing is so mannered it is an affectation a studied display of real or pretended feeling. the whole book lacks affect; it lacks the real emotion that it so desperately tries to convey in its own affect-less way. the writer has talent sure but here it is squandered.  I like the premise, it 's enticing; who does not want to read about the fragile cloistered lives of insular rich white people who summer on their own private island? makes us not-rich people feel better reading about the miserable rich. I guess?    but why go to all that trouble setting up class critique and racial tensions and family drama and dressing it up in fairy tale finery when that will all just be thrown away on a maudlin twist ending with a corny moral message: \"Be a little kinder\"... ugh!  those ideas went nowhere those ideas were rendered pointless because in the end the book is not a scouring brillo pad after all, it 's just another soppy wet sponge.  rub that sponge on your face it will look like you cried!   4 book reviews: This was, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and well-crafted books I have read in a really long time.  Elements that made this book outstanding: 1) It started with a map and a family tree. Talk about setting yourself up for success! 2) The personification of emotion. This might not make sense unless you have read the book, but wow it was powerful. 3) The use of fairy tales from the main character to describe situations. 4) The sense of complete mystery and suspicion: I was always questioning everything. 5) The use of dramatic lines. You know when an author brings in an epic moment-stopping line? This was full of those awesome drops! 6) The moment. There 's a moment where all is revealed and IT WAS PERFECT. 7) The consequential understanding. Everything suddenly clicked into place and it was glorious. 8) The side characters. I think sometimes side characters can feel inconsequential and here they felt really important.  There were not very many things I did not like, to be honest, but there was one: 1) The title. It does't make sense to me. I do not want to say anything in case spoilers, but I do not think it 's the perfect title.  Two final things: 1) I have a theory. I have a theory about this book that I am really excited to discuss so I am going to make a video about it! 2) This book really made me cry. Like explode cry. Lots of tears. And I have only ever cried at 2 other books.  I absolutely recommend this book, to everyone who likes books, because MAN, THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK.  5 book reviews: It 's true what they are saying: you are better off if I tell you nothing about this book.  So I will just say two things.  1) It is worth reading. Even though I only gave it 3 stars.  2) I gave it 3 stars because of the writing style, which irritated the hell out of me. The fact that it got 3 stars after annoying me so much will hopefully give you some indication of how much I liked the idea.  It 's a very clever book and an incredibly sophisticated piece of YA. BUT... an execution that was not to my tastes. The writing was too choppy and fragmented and I hated the frequent use of nouns as adjectives. Like this:    6 book reviews: \"Read it.  And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.\"  This book was great, you guys! I love the writing style. It was not confusing at all! It was not annoying! :) I loved the characters. They were so complex and not bland at all. They definitely did not want to make me want to shoot myself in the head! :) I knew what was going on and I enjoyed this story a lot! The ending was just beautiful. Literally all I can ask for! :)  I LOVE THIS SM I AM CRYING! :) :) :) :) :) :)  7 book reviews: We were tedious. 8 book reviews: Tragic, yet hauntingly beautiful story. 9 book reviews: we were little shits 10 book reviews: Cadence and her family spend every summer on a private island, courtesy of her racist and classist grandfather.  All of her aunts constantly vie for the grandfather 's attention and favor (in an attempt to keep ahold of the family fortune).  Cadence and her cousins consider themselves above such petty actions and spend most summersand taking advantage of the liquor bar.  Then, two summers ago, something happens.  Everyone knows but Candace... and everyone absolutely refuses to tell her.  And she 's bound and determined to find out, one way or another.  I do not want to go into too much depth with the plot because I strongly feel that by giving away the twist (even hints at the twist) would  The twist was literally the only thing that kept me going.  Candace is such a great example of why kids should be given hard limits.  This chick literally goes to a private island every summer.... and all she does is about it.    I guess I understand why the author does this, by the end of the novel, I felt bad for thislittle girl, who only could go to a island every summer.  Honestly, I do not know how she could handle it.  I suppose she did have one, overarching hobby: love.  I am not kidding. Her only hobby is waxing poetic about how  And this is not normal love,  Which is a whole other class of adoration.  There 's this: and this: AND THIS! Her talking about love nearly made me put the book down.  In typical YA fashion, she is more in than feeling any emotion.  Annnd...that 's all there was that was not directly connected with the twist. Just her whining on and on about how much she loves the boy OR about how her rich family. Fab.   The reader did her best with what she was given.  | | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads  11 book reviews: I do not cry a lot but boy this had me sobbing I do not even know how to describe the feelings this story left me with. Just read it and you will understand 12 book reviews: lets play two truths and a lie. ready? i will go first.  - this book has an unreliable narrator and you cant trust anything she tells you.  - this story has such deep secrets, even its secrets have secrets.  - this novel has a twist that you wont see coming, but you will try to convince yourself that you did.  think you got it?  i can guarantee you dont.  because the best lies are those based on truth.  so read this book for yourself.  maybe then you will be able to spot the imposter.  and if anyone asks you,  just lie.   13 book reviews: um. no.  am glad to have read this though so i can unhaul it! ngl it 's satisfying getting rid of stuff you have owned forever. 14 book reviews: it 's so bad i want to give you a zero, but that 's not possible so i give you a one 15 book reviews: so, just like Little Bee, this book begs you \"NOOO, DON'T TELL ITS SEEEEKRITS!!\" and if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.  so part of me is tempted to write this whole long review about how this book is a magical adventure focusing on a young girl in manhattan during the blackout of 2003, when all the red pandas living in the sewers came out to play, carrying tiny flashlights and shepherding people from manhattan to their homes in the outer boroughs and all the lessons this young girl learns along the way from her red panda guide about life and humanity and art history and, ultimately, herself.    because i would read that book.  instead, i am just going to say that it is perhaps unwise to market a book in this way. true, the only reason i read it myself was because i came across it when making YA list for work, and i was all \"SECRETS?? I LOVE SECRETS!! I WANT TO KNOW THE SECRETS!!\" it 's a very effective way of drumming up interest around a book.  but the problem is, when you are for a big twist, it is very easy to the big twist, which i did very early on. if you think you are just reading a book about some rich family and a girl with a faulty memory and a mysterious summer, with no tantalizingly bossy instructions about keeping the book 's secrets, you might be more surprised when the reveal is revealed. but when such a big deal is made of SHHHHHHH, and you know you are expecting something unexpected, you will probably find it, and so reading the book just becomes an exercise in waiting for the character to figure it out. which is fine, but less effective in terms of shock value.  i liked it anyway, but i think it would have been more fun to gasp in genuine surprise at the path it took. so forget i said anything, forget what the synopsis tells you to do, and just read it like you would any other book.  this should help you forget everything you have ever known:     16 book reviews:  We were warm and shivering, and young and ancient, and alive.\"  When I began to read this book I went in completely blind and had absolutely no clue what it was about. The blurb on the back didn t tell me anything about the plot and everything I knew was that  We Were Liars  had apparently won the YA Goodreads Choice Award in 2014. So yeah, I just decided to read it and hoped it would be good and looking at it in retrospective this actually was the best decision I could have made! ;-P  Because let s face it, this book will mess with your head big time. The Liars will make you wonder, they ll make you question what happened in summer 15 and you ll not only become curious but you ll also feel a need to read on. XD    Of course there are plenty of hints, but will you be able to figure them out or will you be in the dark until the end? I guess by now you already realised that this isn t one of my typical reviews and yes, you re right. I won t write anything about the plot. Sorry?! No, I think I m not. *lol*    This is a book you ll have to experience for yourself! And I want you all to scream: when you finally reach the ending. Haha! And before you ask, yes I screamed it loud and clear!!! XD This story is a mindfuck and even my (usually very) observant mind wasn t ready for the finale! ;-P  So all I m going to do is to give you a little character description. The rest you ll have to figure out on your own. XD                    Are you curious and intrigued already?  If yes, I hope you ll enjoy the book as much as I did. It was a really nice and fast read and it definitely exceeded my expectations. No! Truth be told, it completely messed with my mind. But we all love deliberate confusion, don t we? ;-P    17 book reviews: *5 Stars*  There s not even a Scrabble word for how I m feeling right now   This story left me defeated, but its tragedy was paired equally with an unconventional beauty. It gripped me instantly to the point where I couldn t stop thinking about its mystery   Its intrigue.  Its quiet calamity.  The suspense is painted on rather thickly, which is not to say that readers will not form an accurate theory early on. But the journey remains worth it whether you ve Sherlock Holmes d this one or not.  The plot introduces itself in a vague manner and slowly unravels. I found that the messages held more power than the characters delivering them the sum was definitely greater than its parts. Which fit the tone nicely.  This review may seem just as ambiguous as the story itself, but it must be if you wish to obtain the full effect of its delivery.  I will say this, however: is a haunting portrayal of a group of teenagers who have formed a sacred bond; each one striving to be free and longing for acceptance. They consider more important than social and economic stature, and are displeased with the prejudices surrounding their world.  They are young. They are passionate. They are imperfect.  They each suffer their own personal injustice. And this is story.    The writing was unique and although it may not suit everyone s taste, I relished it. I thought the author s use of descriptive imagery was creative and applied with a gentle hand nothing over-the-top or showy.  The story is told through the voice of a confused, emotional, and dejected eighteen year old girl and the writing remained consistent with her distinctive perspective. It was poetic and profound drifting in as a gentle breeze and building to the swirling force of a hurricane. It may not knock your socks off, but it certainly took my breath away.    I d recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a plot that persuades you to wonder. To readers who can accept the bittersweet circumstances of life displayed within their fiction. This is not a character-driven novel. The story shines brighter. I do not think I ever fully connected with any character at all--and the fact that I was moved to tears by the finish is what made this a five-star read for me.    Although I found this story entirely unique, if I had to compare, I d say its structure reminds me a bit of . Its haunting tone, as well.  A truly addictive, out-of-the-box read!

Hated the characters. Sure, it 's a interesting concept, but it was badly executed. All the messages were shallow and fell short. And I am not going to sympathize with a conventionally attractive old money rich white family whose only problems stem from their own selfishness and egocentrism. 23 book reviews: ____________________________________________  Be a little kinder than you have to.   ____________________________________________    Okay so where to begin.

I just posted my full booktalk! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uex... =) 26 book reviews: [song match - Glory and Gore by Lorde.]  I love this book. I really do. I did not expect to, but then I just fell in love with it and now it 's an obsession.  The writing is pretty controversial - it s the style of writing that people either love or hate, no in between. This type of book isn t for everyone. It s a very flowery, metaphorical, lots-of-paragraph-breaks style of prose that s super dreamy and a little too dramatic. Luckily for me, I fall into the category of people who love this writing style.  I do understand why people hate on it so much. I just love it too much to listen.  I read in the ~extra~ part of my edition that E. Lockhart intended for this book to be through the eyes of a trauma survivor. She talked about the research she did about stages of trauma and events that might cause those mental effects.  And then she slayed.  In my opinion, at least.    It wasn t the most traditional sense of mental health representation, but it still gave a very unique look at trauma rep. The trippy, metaphorical writing layered with the distortion from Cadence s mind added so much to the plot. It made things so much more...confusing, but in a dreamy way.  I also loved the in this book. A lot of people talk about court intrigue in fantasy books/books with monarchy systems, but if you really want the dirt then books like this work just fine. There was all this internal fighting, family members blowing up (NOT LITERALLY), and tangled relationships.     We Were Liars  follows Cadence Sinclair Eastman. Her mother s side of the family, the Sinclairs, are  old-money Democrats  as she puts it. They spend their summers on a private island called Beechwood Island.  This book...I would call it . I got seriously drawn in by this whole  rich-white-person  thing. It was amazing to read about private islands and summers on the beach and family drama. Imagine being so privileged that your biggest worry is which one of your sisters is wearing the family pearl necklace (*ahem* Kardashians).  Do not worry, this book is not trashy.  I loved that feeling of constant perfection. How despite being messed up, the Sinclairs managed to be  sparkling, sunburnt and blessed  - despite being awful, they were perfect. There was just that consistent ethereal quality.    This book was unique. The quality of the writing, the expressiveness and the atmosphere of the whole thing just drew me in. Every single time.  Another thing I loved was how different the characters were. The whole book is from Cady s first-person narrative, and as you can tell, that narrative is very individual only to Cadence. The writing style and the prose would have been completely different if it had been from any of the other characters  perspectives. Imagine if Gat or Johnny or Mirren had narrated this.  It wouldn t have been the same.    I would absolutely recommend this book. It stole my heart and then ripped it to pieces. The prose and lyrical tone drew me in and then broke me. Three words I would use to describe it: , , and   27 book reviews: Reread 2/13/21. Still amazing. Still crying.  OH MY GOD. Hands down, this is by far the most amazing book I have read so far this year, and possibly a good part of last year. I went into it knowing hardly anything about it, which is the way it should be. Now that I am done, I literally want to pick it up and start it all over again.  I know alot of people dislike the disjointed writing, but it did not bother me in the least. I flew through this book today despite being extremely busy at work, and I came home and immediately picked it back up. I just finished it after taking far too long of a bath and becoming raisin-y just because I could not bear to put the book down. I finished and got out of the bath (which had doubled in water volume due to tears) and IMMEDIATELY came to write my review. Still a little weepy.    But seriously, GO READ THIS. Stop what you are doing and go get it RIGHT NOW. It will blow you away.  As for me? I am gonna go eat a bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and find something happy to read. I will be ok, really.   28 book reviews: Good lord, this book. 29 book reviews: something you have to respect about a book with a twist is that it 's all twist.  take this, for example. no one ever talks about the lovable characters, or the memorable relationships, or the lovely writing.  that 's because it does not have any of that. it 's a twist and that 's all.  previous to this moment the entirety of my review of this was the following: \"what???\"  and in truth that sums it up!

    " 2022": "0 book reviews: I m such a sucker for massive cookbooks I can open up on my tablet. It makes cooking so much easier. And so does this cookbook. There are a ton of wonderful recipes in here that are clear, easy-to-follow, and delicious. My favorite is the orange-flavored cupcakes, though a lot of the breakfast recipes are giving it a run for that title. It s so easy to put something together, stick it in the fryer, and carry on with my morning. There are also a bunch of recipes I know my kids are going to like, so I love that this is so family-friendly. I think that no matter what I want to cook or why, there s something in here that will satisfy everyone. This is a wonderful book for beginners or folks who feel a little more confident in their skills.  1 book reviews: Lot of recipes, some I viewed as pointless as they could be done better by other cooking methods. Just because you can air fry some dish does mean you should. Not enough about the basics lf air frying as I would hped. Does not seem to be a decent basic guide on the market. Also this an book of American origin and no effort has been made to convert to UK or European ingredients, weights, and measures. No decent index either. Not a problem for me, but I know this drives others crazy. If you just want lots of recipe ideas this is the one for you.  2 book reviews: Very interesting recipes and a good introduction to air frying. 3 book reviews: Great book for the beginning air fryer user! 4 book reviews: A good basic cookbook for the new air fryer cook. I quickly found recipes to try out. No pictures, but recipes are highly simple and clearly written. 5 book reviews: This cookbook is a must have if you use an air fryer. It has so many recipe options to choose from, and there 's always something new to make. I like that I eat healthier when using my air fryer, and these recipes taste delicious! I use this book almost daily to make family dinners, and they are always wonderful! 6 book reviews: Good for easy ingredient cooking  The cooking instructions are easy to follow but I d like to see a bit more detail so I can be sure I don t misinterpret the requirements. Nutrition information needs to be included for each recipe. 7 book reviews: Appreciate this book immensely and have bought it for family members. The recipes are easy to follow, usually take a small amount of prep time and short time to cook.  It helped me guage how long to cook items and use an air fryer. 8 book reviews: Fairly good recipes  Need page numbers. Possibly, should specify what size air fryer is required for the recipes. Do not know if the table of contents will allow you to access recipes. 9 book reviews: Interesting recipes with something for everyone 10 book reviews: Boring! No pics. Just lists of recipes. Moving on! 11 book reviews: Lotsof great recipes  There are lots of great sounding recipes. I am going to enjoy trying them out. I would have given it 5 stars if the recipes had nutritional information. 12 book reviews: Best cookbook for Air Fryers  Great assortment of recipes, no canned food required! You actually make it! Highly recommened! You ca not go wrong with this. 13 book reviews: This book was given to me by my daughter Elizabeth Dela-Cruz for Christmas 2021. 14 book reviews: meh. lackluster recipes, no images.  Recipes were ok. Nothing I couldn t find on Pinterest. No images. Some of these weren t even specific to air fryers. 15 book reviews: Great cookbook. 16 book reviews: I have read and used many diffrent Air Fryer cookbooks. And this one is hands down one of the best! 17 book reviews: I liked how many recipes there are and some of them become my favourite ones 18 book reviews: Just got a new air fryer and needed some new recipes to try it out with. 19 book reviews: Tbe absolute best book for air fryers out there! 20 book reviews: I really wish there were some pictures of the recipes 21 book reviews: Some good recipes but very poorly organized. no index of recipes ",
    " From Crook to Cook: Platinum Recipes from Tha Boss Dogg's Kitchen (Snoop Dogg Cookbook, Celebrity Cookbook with Soul Food Recipes) (Snoop Dog x Chronicle Books)": "book name: House of Sky and Breath (Crescent City) 0 book reviews:  Reread- Nov 2023  I love this series so much. In fact I love anything written by SJM at this point. I got no words, so will keep it brief.  Am gonna cry, the ending to this is so chaotic, and heartbreakingly beautiful. I NEED MOREEEE. I cannot wait for CC3. No matter what I say, am genuinely not prepared for it. Lol I thought I would react calmly to the ending after rereading, heck no.  I love and their sizzling chemistry. The way the two care for each other is everything. Their journey is definitely going to be a painful one ahhh. will be high on my list too, their dynamic is so beautiful, am expecting there will be a lot of angst and some forgiveness to come for them in the next book. will have some bigger role to play, and I ca not wait to find out. So much happens in this one with too, I need to find out what happens next.  All I can say is if you have not read this series yet, you are missing out. ~ ~ ~   I'M SCREAMING. LITERALLY. I might have died. WHAT AN ENDING.   I ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY LOVE YOU SARAH J. MAAS. OH. MY. GOSH. (Please excuse my screaming. I have lived).  Okay, I think I have calmed down enough to review this now that I have had time to process the bombshell Sarah dropped. I swear I have been admiring that last chapter ever since I finished it   I had definitely stopped breathing, especially when the name of certain someone appeared.  Firstly, Kudos to Sarah for writing such a masterpiece. I think it 's going to be one of the best reads of 2022. I do not think I have read a bad review of it so far and rightly so. The book starts off at a good pace which she maintained throughout, especially compared to House of Earth and Blood. This was so much better than what I had expected. If I could have given more than 5 stars, I would.  What really interested me was the character development of Hunt, Tharion and Ruhn in particular. Their journey is one worthy of praise. Hunt 's power and Ruhn 's purity is commendable. Tharion ended up being my favourite, I enjoyed his struggles and his tough decisions, it brought more personality to the limelight. I was hoping he would have made a different choice at the end but it 's going to be interesting to see what direction his story takes. Bryce was as usual badass. It was so good to see how she was struggling with Danika 's constant secrets, it made her seem more human, instead of a robotic push over. What lays ahead of her in the series is going to be so good to see. There was a lot of foreshadowing done, ca not wait to see how it unfolds. Cormac was a nice addition. Ithan and his struggles are shown well and the way he 's welcomed into the group is just heartwarming to see. Flynn and Declan as usual are underrated supporting characters. I feel we do not give them much credit. The other supporting characters bring out great chemistry between the group as a whole. It just works out so well   The plot as a whole had a lot of twists, some of which had me shocked but it works well together. Their world just got bigger and there are lot of possibilities to explore, I do wonder how Sarah would incorporate it all. It 's going to be a challenge considering the fan expectations will hit the roof, but I bet she can pull it off.  Also, if anything happens to Hunt and Bryce, Ruhn and Tharion, I am SUING.    I already CANNOT WAIT for the third book in the series. It 's going to be mind-blowing for sure.  Through love, all is possible    1 book reviews: I...  I do not have the words. I will try to write a review but bear with me.  First, let me just say that if anything happens to Ruhn and Hunt I am going to riot. And yes, that 's a threat.  Ok, now to the review.  This book stressed me. I ca not even count the number of times I had to put it down and walk away for a minute because I was scared to read what happened next. Every time I thought I knew where the story was going, a whole other layer of complications and magic and worldbuilding was added to the mix. It was a rollercoaster in every way.  While I did predict the outcome to several plot twists, like the identity of agent Daybright, there were a billion other twists that I did not see coming, like that ending for which nothing could have prepared me for!!!!. And honestly, it 's because half the time most of those twists were coming entirely out of left field and it was all Danika 's fault! After a while, it kinda felt like SJM just wanted to introduce new things and did not know how so she threw them into Danika 's bag of secrets and called it a day.    Ruhn was my favorite. I picked him out in book one as my comfort character in this series and I am way too invested in this man 's well-being. Ruhn, Declan, Flynn, Ithan, and Tharion. I loved them. I loved the dynamic and I loved how Ruhn 's house just kept getting more and more crowded and they all just accepted it like it was nothing. That brood of highly competent, badass idiots are all my babies and they better come out unscathed.  Nothing will ever come close. I was worried about Hunt, I am not gonna lie. Sarah has a tendency to bait us into falling for one guy, just for another dude to come in for the win. But no, Bryce and Hunt were everything together. There 's nothing else to say.  Overall, this was great. I loved it. Not as much as I did the first book, I have to admit. But I loved it. And no, this was not really a review. I did not even mention the plot of the novel, but if you have made it this far you probably already know what it 's about.  So yeah. That is all. Go read this book. Talk about it with me in the comments. That ending left me with too many emotions. Goodbye.  But before you go!  My final question to this all, the one that has bothered me since book one and plagues me to this day: Like actually though? You ca not be on pointe with hooves and bent legs. Every time they mentioned June dancing my brain almost spontaneously combusted trying to conjure up a visual! At this point,  2 book reviews: HELLO, YES. I FEEL SO VALIDATED NOW. Sarah really said: Hold my champagne, I ve got work to do and hearts to destroy. Just ... I was right, y all. I WAS RIGHT. It is 4am and I am reeling and I haven t slept and just holy shit. Sarah did that.  Also, can we just take a moment to appreciate the bro club in this book? Ruhn, Declan, Flynn, AND MY PRECIOUS ITHAN. Okay, Ruhn is still my favorite but ITHAN came out of left field, barreled into me with a boyish smirk and a wink, and next thing I knew I was on my knees *cough* He is a must protect. And Tharion and Cormac? SJM just working her magic, that s all.  Love Bryce and Hunt still of course, but SJM s side characters have a way of jumping off the page and tunneling into your heart. This book is no exception.  The romance delivers, the plot delivers, the EASTER EGGS, the tension, the camaraderie and humor and banter between characters delivers, and THE PLOT TWISTS!?! Holy mother of all plot twists. I mean, yes, I ve definitely been wanting that and assumed it might be the case, but I didn t actually expect SJM to do it AND make it so integral to the plot. It was unexpected, and I both loved it and immediately had mixed feelings because it opens a whole can of worms but after another day of letting it all sink in, I am here for it. I m excited, and game to see what comes next, and I know SJM has our backs.  My theories are ABOUND and the connections I ve been making in the time since finishing are off the charts. This space is spoiler free, but I can t wait until we can discuss things more fully  Enjoy the book!      MY SUMMONING CIRCLE WORKED, Y ALL. HOUSE OF SKY AND BREATH COMING AT YOU JAN 2022.

I have no hesitation in giving 5 sensational stars for another mind blowing and epic fantasy that is possibly my favourite SJM novel yet.  **** NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW ****  Once again SJM has created an ending that is jaw-droppingly brilliant and one that all her fans are going to adore. We are just left speculating as to how SJM will tie all 'this' together, until the next book.  A sensational story in the world of dark fantasy, that is magical and haunting, with an exhilarating plot, powerful world building, a level of suspense that inspires a hungry turn of pages and a brilliant array of characters that I believe are her best cast yet. Ingenious.      Sofie, is about to die with one vital piece of  information hidden in her head, information that could very well be the final piece of this war against the Asteri. The blow that could end it all  and so Bryce, Hunt and Ruhn try to unearth the corruption and the devastating truth that cost Danika her life in the last book and now Sofie in this story. This is not a spoiler as it happens in the first chapter but sets up a storyline that will continue well into the book.  As worlds collide and the Houses of Crescent City seek to take control, the treachery and danger takes us to the city ships of the queen s court, the seven levels of hell and the orrery planet solar system as reluctant alliances are forged to prevent the Asteri taking control.  However, with an order from the Asteri to lie low or endure a penalty of death, the crew must carve out a strategy where the stakes are high, the game is at a different level, and the people only too willing to betray the daughter of the King of the Autumn Court too numerous.  Ignoring the request from her father to strengthen the alliance with the House of Avallen, by marrying Cormac, her cousin, Bryce is left isolated except for her lover and  mate  Hunt and brother Ruhn.    What makes this my favourite Sarah Maas book yet!!!  The Ending   The sensational ending just blew me away. I was left speechless and very happy knowing we have a fantastic set up going into the next book. If you have read other SJM series you will adore it. Although it is worth pointing out that you do not need to have read A Court of Thorns and Roses first.  Storyline and Plot   The plot / subplots are complex, gripping, and captivating and written at a pace that never slows. I loved that multiple sub plots were introduced rather than having everything centred around the two main characters which has become a common thread in SJM s books. However, I feel there is room to make these side stories with other people even stronger and shorter because at 800 pages it feels too long, hence the 4.5 stars.  Main Characters   Hunt and Ruhn are adorable, and although I liked Bryce much better in book 2, The connection is still not great. I would like to see the female characters portrayed differently from  bad ass bitches .  Writing Style   Stunning writing and one I connect with although you need to pay attention given the number of subplots and wide ranging 'fantastical' names. However, for an immersive and absorbing read that captured me through the writing, then it can only be 5 stars.  Imagination   I am in awe of SJM s imagination. Ingenious, creative and explosive with settings like the seven levels of hell, orrery of planets and intricate details like the seven star and its representation, the glowing star on Bryce s chest and symbolic nature of the marks and tattoos.  For  Love and other words    There is no shortage of passion between the main characters. What I loved about this part of the story was Bryce standing up for her right to choose her own  mate  against her fathers wishes. Even better when she achieved this in such a clever way that blindsided everyone around her, including her father.  Book length   This was too long. The Court of Thorns and Roses was in average 500 pages and was just right. At a huge 800 pages this was too long and more importantly not all the content was needed although written well.  Tormenting, imaginative, spellbinding, a fabulous game of brinkmanship, and totally immersive. A book I read over two days and up to  stupid o clock  in the morning to finish, because I hankered to know how it would all end, and what an ending it was - but no spoilers here!!!! And my advice is please do not read reviews that contain spoilers because the element of surprise will leave you speechless and very happy.  I have to confess that this is my favourite book over two series, this and the Court of Thorns and Roses.  Unbelievably good and highly recommended.  __________________________________ I have not re-read but my written review has disappeared so had to create under a new date that seems to have worked. How strange!!! __________________________________  I have read so many fantasy books in the last few years that I needed to refresh myself on the characters, the plot and that ending from this second book in the Crescent City series I read almost 2 years ago. Why? because book 3 is out in January and I could not remember everything in the story.  Happy to say, that I have not changed my opinion of this book after the second read. It is fabulous and testament to its success is that I have chosen to reread rather than use my limited reading time on something new. I will have finished my course by then, and so I will be ready for the next one...  12 book reviews: Listen. That ending? That cliffhanger?!   Still leaves me reeling even though this is my 3rd reread.  The amount of plot twists and revelations in this book? Scandalous.   It was one madness after the other and I was living for all of it.  I m so ready for book 3, my god!         So when the thing happened that everyone was screaming about, you had better understand I screamed. At midnight. I was thrashing around like a damn cartoon character. The excitement! The happiness! The pain! Oh boy!    I m gonna be dreaming about that ending. About this book full stop. Everything about this book shined! The plot, the characters, the side characters, the romance. It all came together perfectly. It 's such a vast and vivid story.  I can t wait to reread this. I ve been in a trance for over a week (the time I ve spent reading this book) and I don t want to wake up.  But the possibilities now    I could choke with excitement! I m !     I m in no way ready for what this book will do to me. But I can t wait for my emotions to be put through the ringer.  Expect relentless updates. It ll be my version of therapy.    Buddy-reading with my support group - & !    13 book reviews: is this manon s hair?  nah okay so then why is everything white and straight     my thoughts on this book:     bryce & hunt are stale asf.  i loved them in the first book and their character development was really good and now it s like sjm thinks she can just stop writing them well because they already had enough character development in the previous book. well, that s not how it works. they are boring now and all they do is talk about having sex. their relationship is bland and i don t even ship them anymore. i liked them in hoeab because they were friends first and then slowly grew to trust each other and be one another s safe space and now they re just oH sO pOWERfuL royalty bitches. they re not an interesting couple, they have no chemistry or individual character development or relationship development and i don t like how hunt is all possessive alpha male bullshit ok bye  sjm thinks she can make it okay that hunt is a bitchy protective asshole by bryce making fun of him for it, but that s still his personality and i hate it. sjm if you actually believe that bryce can handle herself and doesn t need an  alphahole  as you call it, (corny-ass name but whatever,) then make it so.   spoiler  also: bryce doesn t need to be a princess with 10388373 magical powers to be a badass, so fucking leave her alone sjm.     this world building sucks.  nothing is ever explained. here i was thinking that this took place in only one city?? i don t understand anything. there are a bunch of random terms and things thrown in here to make a plot and they are never explained whatsoever. sjm continually has to explain what s going on to us because i don t think she understands her own story all that well, but half of the things she mentions aren t ever explained and i m just left here to fend for myself.  i liked the whole urban fantasy aspect of the first book, how it felt like an actual city and there was an atmosphere to it, but in this book i didn t get any of that at all because the characters were constantly running around doing random shit in  realms  that shouldn t even exist smh     since every single person whose pov we get in this book is straight as a board, i ll make a list of characters i was shipping that have a 99.99% chance of not being canon because sjm won t make any of her main characters diverse.    hunt x baxian (OKAY WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER YALL CANT TELL ME THAT WAS PLATONIC) (literally #1 ship in this book xoxo)   hunt x ruhn (brother in law romance  ) (anyway how ruhn continuously warms up to hunt bEcAusE hEs wItH bRyCe mhm sure keep telling yourself that)   tharion x ithan (these two did so much running around investigating together)   ruhn x ithan (didn t ruhn invite ithan to live with him or was that someone else)   cormac x tharion (CORMAC LITERALLY DID SOME SELF SACRIFICING BULLSHIT FOR THARION DONT TELL ME THEYRE NOT MADLY IN LOVE)   literally everyone in the group of cormac, tharion, ithan, ruhn, hunt (except for cormac and ruhn obviously because they re cousins)   bryce x danika (dont fucking tell me they were jUst fRieNds)   the hind x the viper queen (LISTEN i know these two have probably never met but IMAGINE THE TENSION)   danika x sophie (they were doomed lovers)     SOMEBODY TAKE - AND   AWAY FROM SJM  SHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED  you d think after more than 10 books she would improve her writing style but nope. in this books she used almost word for word sentences from acomaf   please she s plagiarizing her own series        you re a princess   YOURE a princess   EVERYONES A PRINCESS    you have magical powers   and YOU have magical   powers   EVERYONE has magical powers    it gets tiring, i ll tell you that.   spoilers  i liked it better when bryce was a messy person who had everyone see her as a shallow party girl so that they wouldn t see the hurt inside her from losing her best friend (lover)     the plot is so far gone at this point.  all of the things i said previously about the world building also apply to the plot. it doesn t make sense and it s trying to make us  surprised  every time something happens even though nothing is surprising at this point because so much random stuff is going on and apparently absolutely anything is possible.  it seems like we re focusing on one thing and then we ll abruptly move to something else and the whole thing is just really confusing. there s also way too much running around trying to fiGuRe sTufF out, like why do y all even care about what s going on with the rEbeLLioN anyway it has basically nothing to do with you    like is this harry potter or something y all are acting like 12 year olds     has anyone noticed how many male characters there are in relation to the number of female characters?  there are about 6 different male characters whose pov we get and one (1) female character. and OF COURSE everyone oversexualizes her and seventy five percent of the male characters are in love with her.  one of the male characters (who calls her Legs) says at one point,  it s bryce. everyone has a thing for her.   like ok is she just here to be sexualized by everyone now or what  (and i love that owns her sexuality but it s kinda gross seeing all these male povs talk about how hot she is etc etc it just feels very male gaze-y and we don t like objectification of women)     the sex scenes that everyone thinks are  sooooo hot  for some reason are underwhelming asf.  it s literally not hot to start talking about stars and oceans in the middle of a smut scene. i literally don t understand. sjm does that in every single one of her books like why do you have to bring magic into it??  and fire??? and snow??  like  the stars swam around us  the oceans rose and the golden dust on our planet lifted up to brush against our souls. the leaves on the trees fell and the wind  the wind swept us together until our magic fused together and- and we were flying, with galaxies swirling- and our power becoming  becoming one.   there will be something like that right in the middle of a smut scene. like sweetie   that s   not hot    but good for y all who have mountains shaking at you while you re having sex     okay i DID like the night & day thing sue me  i knew who day was the whole time but i SIMP for that character so idec    ruhn seems like one of the more decent men in this series and he has pretty good character development so i actually didn t mind reading about him. his relationship with day was a little bit insta love but they also had chemistry so it worked ig.  the whole reveal was pretty great too even though i already knew who day was (i read spoilers and read the ends of books first because i have no self control ha)  for the most part i support that ship and they re a lot better than watching bryce and hunt try to be sexy when they are actually just stale       i really don t like how all the  males  growl and are all protective of the  females  like stfu  it just gives me icky vibes and since bryce even knows she doesn t want hunt and other guys acting like that and she even tells them so, and they act like that anyways and she just accepts it and has to deal with them i didn t like the message that gives at all. like if she was on her own she could be much freer and do what she wants more.  it helps a little that bryce also gets protective over hunt sometimes but it s not really the same and i still feel like alot of the ways sjm writes these things gives sexist vibes.  maybe this is just personal preference because i don t at all like protective male characters in my books but i m just sick of couples and male characters being written like that.     even if i don t feel like most of sjm s characters are written well at all,    lidia   fury   ruhn   the viper queen   aidas   danika   celestina  ok wow there are a lot of hot people i won t lie   putting myself through 800 pages of this mess was worth it to write this review because i am honestly having so much fun ahahahsjdjdj    also i might be done with sjm bc she s basically just doing fan service at this point  her latest few books (see: acosf and hosab) have been literally the shittiest quality ever and she doesn t know how to include important characters that are anything other than white & cishet - like honey you gladly write all of the most far-fetched fanfic type shit and publish it in your books just because your fans want you to but you won t make the effort to include better representation in your books? do better   14 book reviews: I AM NOT OKAY  i literally ca not believe it ended like that. i am crying, sjm you are evil for doing this to us !  omg the amount of twists and turns in this book had my head spinning!!    i honestly did not think i could love brycehunt even more than i already did and yes they finally fucked, who else cheered      03/20 i really hope this is bryce and hunt 's book because we still did not get that sex scene. I NEED IT    15 book reviews: 4.5 Stars  What the literal hell was that ending!?      I ve got a damn headache!!     - **All I want is Danika and the pack back!  Holy sh t snacks!! This damn cover is everything!!!     16 book reviews: Final reread before CC3: January 16 2024  New rating 3.5/5  In my previous review I mentioned that I would most likely never pick up CC 2 again...and boy am I happy that I did. Reading this novel knowing what happens at the end, the spoilers, who everyone really is...is a completely different experience. My mistake when I first read CC2 was that I had completely forgotten what happened in the first instalment. Now, in 2024, I read CC2 right after CC 1 and wow...I understand everything so much better. All together, I had a much better reading experience the second time around and I am so happy that I gave this book a proper shot.  Yes, some things in my previous review are still correct. The plot was not solidified well, there was alot of filler information and people, the POVs were confusing, and it felt very male centered....however, I cannot deny that craft and thought behind the entirety of the novel. SJM is just too damn good. Even though the middle still dragged on like crazy, reading it while knowing the ending had me reading between the lines.  I did not expect to enjoy it so much. maybe it was the excitement of CC3 coming out in two weeks, but I truly appreciate the work and time this must have taken to write. I feel bad that i despised my first read so much, I despise that I began to skim throughout and missed out on the full experience of the novel.  At the end of the day, SJM is just so intentional. I love how she brings everything full circle. She is one of the best fantasy writers in this generation. she can make me cry so easily. I really loved this, there were slow and confusing parts if we want to be detailed, but after reading the ending again...wow I have chills. I am so excited to see what she has planned after a decade!  If you did not enjoy your first time reading, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a reread right after the first instalment.  AND I AM CALLING IT FIRST: THE VIPER QUEEN AND THARION ARE GONNA GET TOGETHER! YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!  ------------------------------- 3/5- February 2022 Honestly, I waited for this book for so long and am slightly conflicted with how I feel about this story as a whole. I have never rated a SJM novel this low before. I was sometimes forcing myself to read it - like it was some university homework . But I also liked how she took this series to an entire new level- I can tell there was a lot of research done.  Pros: 1. Ruhn and his love story. That storyline between day and night was the most surprising and delightful thing out of this book. The way these two have a hold on me right now. That ending elevator scene was one of the best in the book!! I was here for it!!!  2. The secondary characters and the otters awwwww  3. THE ENDING- what else can I say about that!!  Cons: 1. The plot was just not there for me. I could not feel any major stakes for the characters throughout. They were all fighting a fight that they all barely seemed to even want to be apart of. The majority of the novel was just everyone talking all the time and info dumping loads and loads of things. I genuinely got a headache reading it- like my head still hurts. And also not to mention, the amount of new characters being added. Everyone is so powerful, everyone has this power and blah blah blah- like no one felt special at all because there was every kind of type of being. It s like SJM took every mythical creature to exist and dump them in 800 pages.  2. The POVS were too much. Honestly I love a good multiple POV novel but this was just over doing it. Tell me why there was POV switches mid chapter- and sometimes even three switches. It was honestly too much and the characters really all started to blend into each-other sadly. No one stood out to me, even Bryce. I also was noticing the lack of female POVS. At some points it was all just Bryce in the room of men. Once I caught on, I couldn t stop pointing it out. This novel felt very male centred and I was so over it by the end.  3. The main romance was unnatural and boring . I m sorry but this book made Bryce and Hunt so boring. For a novel that promises lots of heat and tension . It was barely there honestly. It was at no point a ACOMAF type of romance for me (but nothing will ever be). I also got annoyed with how many times Bryce said alphahole and ashole like girl  we re all over it. Almost everyone of her remarks back had to have some vulgar swearing in it. It was fun first but it gets tired very quickly.  My final thoughts for this is that I truly think this novel by itself, was a complete filler for the next one. SJM honestly did not need to write 800 pages of this boring confusing stuff. She could have just given us 200 pages and that last chapter TBH. I see what she did and it was in a way very smart because THE LAST CHAPTER HAD ME SHAKING OKAY! I have hope in the next one because there is an amazing foundation to work with. But for me, I will likely not pick up House of Sky and Breath again.  17 book reviews:  Our love is stronger than time, greater than any distance. Our love spans across stars and worlds. I will find you again, I promise.    OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG THAT ENDING!!!!!      ENDING   Great characters   Rebels and spies   Complex world-building   Plot   Relationships   Magic / Faes / Shifters   Romance and some smut   Pace  Cliffhanger   Trigger warnings: grief, torture, and deaths  4.5 stars. It was great, but not as good as the first one.  _______________________  I am still flabergasted by that ending.  _______________________     This book takes place a few months after the end of House of Earth and Blood. Bryce is trying to adapt to her new reality as the Princess of Fae, while also trying to work things out with Hunt to build a healthy and serious relationship. Hunt is enjoying his newfound freedom and Ruhn is building back the trust between his sister and him. Everything is fine and rather normal until they get sucked into a rescue mission involving some rebels and ruthless faes that will not hesitate to destroy them all should their affiliation with rebels be revealed.    The plot is good, but I didn t find it as good as in the first book. It is full of unexpected twists and shocking revelations though, and the pace is engaging. My heart was pounding and I had to refrain from skimming parts of the book because I was so anxious to know what would happen, but at the same time, I wanted to take my time and savor this book... Conflicted emotions and a few heart attacks apart though, it is a great book and many details from the first book have a big significance in this book, and I like that there was a deeper connection between the books than simply having the same set of characters embarking on a new adventure.             I the characters in this book, . SJM worked her magic once again and made me fall in love with them as I did fall in love with the crew of ACOTAR and TOG. The secondary characters are as lovable and amazing as the main characters. The friendship developing between the guys in this book is so cute and wholesome! Ruhn, Flynn, Declan, Tharion, Hunt, and even Ithan are becoming a cute little boy 's club and my heart is SO happy about that. I said in my review of the first book that I wanted more of Ithan and Tharion, and I got it! Hypaxia is also more present in this book and I can already see that Bryce and her will make a kickass duo.  Okay, now this might be an unpopular opinion, but in light of what we learned in this book, I was not impressed with Danika s choices and behavior toward Bryce, and the friendship I admired so much in the first book turned a little sour. I feel that Bryce gave her everything to Danika, and Danika only gave her a few pieces. I know Danika loved Bryce fiercely, but she kept so many huge secrets from Bryce, and every time Bruce discovers a new truth about Danika, it only upsets her because she sees how little she truly knew about her best friend         The found family is one of my favorite tropes, and I loved every mundane moment with the gang in this book because of this feeling of finally having somewhere to belong. From Hunt making new friends to Ithan and Rhun mending their relationship with Bryce, it was cute, sweet, and so satisfying to see them all finally feel like they belonged somewhere and had people who cared about them.             The romance between Bryce and Hunt is still super cute, and we also have more spicy moments, even though SJM did ensure that Hunt got cockblocked quite a few times before *it* finally happened. They are cute and funny and they still have that witty banter from the first book that I enjoyed so much. I like that the author managed to keep the sexual tension between them for so long and that when they finally did the deed, they didn t turn into sex-obsessed fae/angel and did nothing else for the rest of the book. They enjoyed each other but kept in mind that they had more important things to do and that there were lives on the line.    I am a little disappointed though that Aidas was not more present in this book. I really like him, and I think he has the potential to be a truly complex and interesting morally grey character, but we have not seen enough of him to really know what he is up to and where he stands in the conflict that is to come.  I ca not wait for the next book. There is SO MUCH potential for an even more epic third book, but at the same time, I am SO FREAKING SCARED of what could happen to my babies.             18 book reviews: I had to take some time to really think about this book and what my feelings towards it are. And ultimately I ve decided that I think I hate it lol.  I loved the first book in this series. It was kind of trashy reading, you know? But it was FUN and easy to fly through and the world of Crescent City was so vibrant and full of life that I couldn t get enough.  This one even though it was easy to read, and I finished it up pretty quickly, nothing about it really captured me like the first one. So much time was just spent in Bryce s apartment I felt like, when before we d been wandering the streets and things like that!  Then there s the added POVs. Tharion s was so repetitive and most of his scenes could have EASILY been cut with zero consequence to anything, both in terms of his character and the plot. Ithan s POV also could have been chopped in a lot of parts.  A ton of sideplots seemed to be introduced in this one too, but they felt disconnected from the main story and felt like Sarah was just throwing stuff in to throw stuff in. They took time away from sideplots that had been set up in the previous book and were not explored in nearly enough depth here.  There are plenty of reveals in this book that I think are meant to be surprising but they all just fall flat. Some are quite obvious. Others are not, simply because they come out of left field and seem very random.  The romance was fine. Until it wasn t. Until the stupid concept of  mates  reared its ugly head. I m so over it and it s just tiring. Really seems like SJM just HAS to make sure we as readers know the characters are meant to be together because of this ridiculous fate thing. You shouldn t have to rely on this to show that a couple is meant to be together, FYI. It s not interesting, it s been done to death (across MULTIPLE SERIES!!)  The characters were mostly good still. But it was very male-centred for most of the book. I would ve liked to see Bryce interacting with Fury and Juniper more. And at some points, the men s personalities all just kind of blended together.  I think Sarah is stepping up her diversity game (about time lol), because I was happy to see more queer characters and more characters of colour added to the cast, and were present for good chunks of the book.  That being said the writing in this is very constricted to the gender binary. Things are described as  feminine  and  masculine  and everything is just all watered down to male and female and blah blah blah. This isn t new for SJM, but I would just hope that after how many books this issue would at least start being resolved.  The ending. The ENDING. The whole reason I needed to really take time to think about everything in this book. Because what a disaster. I m gonna go into spoilers for the ending for the next two paragraphs so skip if you don t want that!!  Last spoiler warning .ok. So Bryce jumps into a portal to take her to another world to prevent herself from being used as the Asteri wish, and to hopefully gain allies from the armies of Hel. BUT she doesn t end up in Hel, instead landing in the ACOTAR world. Right outside Rhysand s palace. And the book ends with Rhysand introducing himself to her.  I genuinely don t get how this was published, because this has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever read in my life and I mean that. So, what, now the ACOTAR characters are gonna be in the third one, presumably as somewhat important characters? Let them GO. They have their own series (that has also gone to shit) and don t need to be in this one. It feels so lazy and ridiculous.  End of spoilers!  I m quite disappointed with this one. House of Earth and Blood was genuinely almost my favourite book of 2020, and this is a mess in so many ways, plot-wise, romance-wise, etc.  I can t imagine I ll be tuning in for book 3. And this might also be the last I read of Sarah J Maas.  19 book reviews: \"We waste so much time. Maybe it 's our curse as immortals. To see time as a luxury, a never-ending ocean.\"  I loved every moment of this book. I loved every word. I loved every twist, and every turn, and everything in between.  Sarah J. Maas - thank you so much for making reading so much fun. Every time. Always. I do not know who I would be without Feyre, Ness, and Bryce. I do not want to know because I love who I am with all of their journeys pushing me forward.  This book in particular feels like a big hug. Is it just like every SJM book that takes us on a wild journey of emotion? Yes. But it also feels just a bit different to me. It feels like I am walking next to Bryce the entire time, hanging out with her and her friends. It feels like I am at Ruhn 's house, like I am playing video games with Baxian and Hunt. Or watching Sunball with Ithan and Tharion. It feels like I am laughing as Ithan falls through the coffee table and talking to Bryce and Juniper about dance classes.  I have loved books for a long time, but I do not think I have ever felt so a part of something before.  House of Sky and Breath is all about the chaos that comes from a battle won, wondering when the next thing is going to fall on your shoulders. It 's about choosing to stand up for those who ca not stand up for themselves, even when you finally have the life you have always wanted. It 's dreaming for a future while wondering if there is one out there for you at all.  It 's loving your friends. Remembering to live no matter what is happening around you. Choosing who you want to be and not accepting the life that was chosen for you. Bryce constantly shows us what it means to truly carve your own way in the world, and I will never stop looking up to her. Wanting to be just like her.  The quote I pointed out, does not it just come to embody this series as a whole? We do not know how much time we have with the people we love, so why not make the most of every single moment we do have?  And the plot reflects that entirely.  I will never get tired of reading House of Earth and Blood because I have never read something that more perfectly reflects my own experience with grief and heartache. This book? I will always feel like I found a group of people who will always make me feel included and a part of something.  One thing that fiction will always have over reality is that it can make time stop. We only get what an author chooses to share with us, and no more. A plot will never change, and the people will always be who they were at the last word on a page. It 's one of the most comforting feelings in the world that no matter what happens, characters will always be who they were the first time we read them.  They change, the adapt, they live, they die... but they never leave you. People drift. It 's human nature to move on, change and grow. But our favorite characters are always right there on a bad day. A good one. A weird one. A sad one.  I will walk every world with Bryce, and I will do so for the rest of my life.  I ca not wait for book three.  20 book reviews: #1 House of Earth and Blood   3.5 stars  WHAT IN THE NAME OF CROSSOVER INSANITY SATANS TIT IS THIS     to Hel with me banking on this book to be better than the previous installment cause this was a downgrade. i was bored through most of it, and finishing it had felt like a chore.    although... i feel like this was in a way that the next book would get good and exciting again since the stakes are higher now. but who knows, we ll probably have to wait another two years to find out. should i quit while im ahead?    i had guessed that was Lidia, but that last chapter i really did not see coming. when i said  i needed SJM to pull a Rhysand,  i didnt mean LITERALLY.   does that mean Bryce is in Velaris now?    we ve managed to go without any  mates  business in book 1, but now so many of them (couple/pairing plot twists) were dropped like bombs in this book. the romance was done very poorly. how did SJM go from Aelin/Rowan, Elide/Lorcan, and Feyre/Rhys to crap?    Ruhn & Lidia, i didnt hate the idea of them, but wow the instalove had me wanting to barf.   though now that they know each others true identity, maybe there ll be more tension between them in book 3.    Bryce & Hunt seriously? am i the only one who couldnt feel the connection/passion between them? theyre better off as friends. also, the smut. from none (book 1) to... how many scenes in this book? idk what to say. and they werent that either.    im so disappointed Aidas didnt even make an appearance in this book. he was mentioned and impersonated, but no signs of the Prince of the Chasm. :( would it be foolish to hold out hope for him & Bryce? especially after what happened with Bryce & Hunt.    idk if its me no longer being a teenager who adored SJMs books, but so far im finding this series is even worse than TOG & ACOTAR. especially, the writing and the romance.   21 book reviews: Okay, this was cool and all, but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe I was too excited to read it and it had the opposite effect? I also think I should have reread HoEaB before I went into this because I sometimes could not remember who was who and to put myself in the right mood. I will give it another try next month and review it properly then.  ACTUAL RATINGS 3,5/5 __ Not that I kept count or anything but I have been waiting for this for 348 days, 22 hours, 49 minutes and 54 seconds. I am .  22 book reviews:   1st read Feb 2022: 3.75 stars   2nd read Jan 2024: 3.75 stars  even tho i looked up spoilers on twt, i am still SHOOK reading that chapter at the end dslfsjkdfl wtf that was just fucking wild   also jail to SJM for leaving us with that cliffhanger and now we probably have to wait til spring 2024 til the next book comes out. this is a hate crime against me.  now lemme go back crying    23 book reviews: I FINISHED. IT S DONE MY MIND IS REELING AND I M ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS.  I definitely don t have words right now, my brain is fried at how amazing this was. This book s bar was set at sky high levels, and hands down my most anticipated book of 2022, or maybe ever. I was not disappointed in the slightest. I love this world & characters more than I thought possible. I m even more obsessed than I was before.  I saw part of the ending spoilers before the book was released, but it honestly didn t even matter or take away from the ending as a whole. There were a million other things happening that were just as insane.  I will be rereading this immediately. I need CC3 more than air.    HUNT ON THE COVER LIKE THE KING HE IS!!!  WE FINALLY HAVE A TITLE & CONFIRMED RELEASE DATE!!!!!  EDIT- March 2021:  -CC2 should be out around March 2022 but there s no official date. The tentative date on Goodreads for November 2021 is wrong  -Sarah knows the title but can t say it yet. The same cover artist who designed HoEaB will be doing CC2 s cover  -Bryce & Hunt will be  very satisfied  sexually. (She said in a previous livestream it will rival the smut amount/steam level in ACOSF!)   - Me realizing there is absolutely no info about this whatsoever.......    PLEASE let it be sooner than later that we get a cover, title, description, release date, literally anything...I NEED MY BABIES BACK   24 book reviews: 4.5/5    *coughs* *checks voice* *coughs again but louder* WHAT IN THE HEL I JUST READ AND HOW CAN LITERALLY 15 PAGES AT THE END CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE ENTIRELY  After those last 15 pages I literally trust no one anymore, especially SJM. I need answers!!!!!  25 book reviews: FIVE STUNNING STARS  First read: 5-stars  Second read: 5-stars  Third read: 5-stars   It always feels like coming home whenever there is a new SJM book and House of Sky and Breath was nothing short of phenomenal    I took my sweet time savoring every page because I did not want the book to end but... here we are...  I am not sure when I will write a proper review but I am still overwhelmed by everything that has happened in this book (despite being spoiled by parts of it already but thankfully it did not ruin my reading experience)  You truly see how Sarah had grown as an author in this book!       Okay I am back again to type in some more because my head is still reeling from this book  Sarah is truly the gift that keeps giving!!  The characters old and new were simply fantastic! Each character for their own moment of spotlight and although I cared only for Bryce and Hunt 's story but this book managed to get me attached to all of these characters and especially Ruhn and Tharion.  Sarah crafted an epic story in this installment and I do not know how many times I will say I am mindblown. It 's neatly action-packed, so many things are happening at once that you ca not put the book down.  And it 's not an SJM book if it did not take you on a one hell of a rollercoaster ride.  Did I laugh? So many times Did it make me happy? It did Did it grate my nerves? Oh yes Did it make me cry? No question  I am already on theory mode just trying to dissect everything that has happened in this book because there is SO MUCH  The romance was served on a golden platter and I got more than what I asked for and it 's not only in regards to Quinlar but boy were Quinlar very satisfied in HOSAB.  I did not anticipate HOSAB to take a very dark turn but it did and it left me so shook.

    " How to Catch a Leprechaun": "book reviews: The art is bright and vibrant. It jumps off the page at you.  This book needs to be renamed to How not to catch a Leprechaun. Nothing they did worked. The Leprechaun is sneaky. So, once a year he likes to enter people 's houses simply to avoid traps. It 's an entertaining story. The kids loved this one. They laughed their way through it. 1 book reviews: This one will give the kids ideas on how to make a mess! I love the fun in reading this though. 2 book reviews: Adorable illustrations and story! 3 book reviews: A funny and cute story about catching a leprechaun. Bright and colorful art that comes to life in this book. I also like the rhymes and use of words. Great story for kids. 4 book reviews: I m a bit behind for St. Patrick s Day but this story was cute, rhyming and clever. The illustrations were colorful and lively and the story is fun for all children and adults alike. I could see this being read in a classroom and kids being asked to come up with their own traps for catching a leprechaun-drawing, building, etc. or something fun for kids to do now while in the midst of home lockdowns...you could use crayons, play doh, building blocks, items around the house...a cute read for St. Patrick s Day or anytime.  5 book reviews: STEAM combined with Saint Patrick 's Day. Love it! 6 book reviews: Only 32 pages, it was very cool :) 7 book reviews: Black, White, Latin, Asian- Kids of all nations want nothing more than to CATCH THAT LEPRECHAUN! #irishpride (#notirish, #honoraryirish) 8 book reviews: This story is a very engaging story that is written in prose. This book is a book I read during Saint Patricks day in conjunction with a STEM activity to add to the story 's plot. Throughout this story the students are shown different ways that kids have tried to catch the leprechaun but have been unsuccessful each time. In the illustrations you can see many intricate designs and many different strategies that each child used. This leads to multiple discussions on how they tried and why they were unsuccessful at catching the leprechaun. With each turn of the page the students are able to discuss what they could have done differently to catch the leprechaun. The book ends in such a great way and is left the students saying MEEEE I CAN DO IT!!!!!! \"You will never catch this Leprechaun. Impossible! That 's a fact! Unless, one day, a brilliant child designs the perfect trap! Who will this child be?\" This book is a WOW book to me because the illustrations and words seem to pop off the page and draw you into the story. I believe the author and illustrator did a FABULOUS job with this book. If you have not read the book just yet go ahead and buy your copy now because once March rolls around it will be sold out!  9 book reviews: Wallace, Adam. How to Catch a Leprechaun. 1 CD. unabridged. 6 min. Dreamscape Media. ISBN 9781520063416.  The bestselling creators of the holiday classic, How to Catch an Elf, are back with another adorable book to delight children and families. Perfect for St. Patrick 's Day or just general laughs, How to Catch a Leprechaun, will inspire children to get creative and build the best \"leprechaun traps\" they can invent. A naughty leprechaun taunts the reader on every page that the traps set out by other children are not clever enough to catch him or his pot of gold. Since the leprechaun ca not be caught, he wreaks havoc on the house, dying the toilets green and other mischievous pranks that children will enjoy. Narrated with British joviality by Qarie Marshall, children will delight in his hilarious telling of the naughty leprechaun who ca not be caught. - Erin Cataldi, Johnson Co. Public Library, Franklin, IN  10 book reviews: Summary: St. Patrick 's Day is near and the leprechaun is here. He is going around houses and testing the traps set out for him. He is pretty confident that no trap will catch him and he is having loads of fun testing them all and creating big messes on the way. He says it 's impossible to catch him and says it 's a fact. Unless, one day, a brilliant child designs a perfect trap.  Review: This book should be called How Not to Catch a Leprechaun, considering all the attempts are fiascos and loads of fun for us readers. The rhythmic and rhyming text, with colorful and funny illustration, are great. This book is a definite winner for the little ones and I would recommend it as an ideal St. Patrick 's Day read-aloud for preschool - Grade 1 - especially if they are about to design or test their leprechaun traps.  11 book reviews: We received this book to give an honest review. LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this story of how to catch a leprechaun. I read this to both K and A at different times. A being three liked to find the leprechaun that was avoiding being captured and thought the pictures were cool. K read this book to me and could not believe all the traps that the kids were putting in place. He thought it was funny when the leprechaun took care of the smelly shoes. This book is a great story to read whenever but it is perfect for St. Patrick 's Day . The pictures are bright and colorful and I think will keep the children engaged and laughing.  12 book reviews: I have fallen hard for Adam Wallace and his 'How to Catch' series of picture books. Perfect recommendation for read aloud, storytime and for teachers to use to instill S.T.E.M. or S.T.E.A.M. for creative thinking; Told through rhyme and colorful illustrations, a clever leprechaun is not impressed by the traps laid out by kids and even the grown up 's who try to catch him, and the book keeps the reader guessing, will they catch him? Can they catch him?  The book offers up a lot of ideas for rube Goldberg and inventor types, see if you can make your own leprechaun trap. Can you catch a leprechaun?  13 book reviews: The title is a little misleading - they never do catch the leprechaun, but there are plenty of ideas on how to try! Not exceptional or truly classic, but for a younger audience at a St. Patrick 's Day storytime, this fits the bill. So many St Patrick 's day picture books are longer, harder to keep a larger audience of young ones focused. This one is short, has a lot of silly details in the pictures, and the rhymes flow fairly well. I will definitely be using it again for storytimes in the future. 14 book reviews: A fun, rhyming book that that follows the attempts of children and their families to construct traps for catching a leprechaun. The whole town seems to be in on the fun, but will they succeed? Bright colorful illustrations, coupled with silly situations, make this a fun and engaging read.  Check this book out from the Villa Park Public Library! 15 book reviews: Another fun \"How to Catch a...\" series by the author and illustrator. My son said though the title is misleading because they do not tell how to catch the leprechaun they show all the different ways the leprechaun escapes the many different traps kids set up. I have a full review on my blog.  https://adalinc.org/2017/03/st-patric...  *I received a copy of this book from Raincoast Books in order to facilitate a review*  16 book reviews: This is the book I would recommend to read the elementary class on St. Patrick 's Day. It shows how the characters plan to catch the leprechaun after he leaves messes for them after their traps to catch him do not work. This would be a good story starter or prompt for kids to write their own ideas for catching a leprechaun and finding his pot of gold. Colorful and fun illustrations. 17 book reviews: Read this cute little St. Patrick 's Day book with the kinders today. It is told from the leprechaun 's point of view as he nimbly avoids all the traps that are set for him. It rhymes and has vivid illustrations. I would highly recommend to everyone who has small children or a classroom to read for the holiday. 18 book reviews: It was harder than I thought to find a book for St. Patrick 's Day that was kind of what I was looking for. This book introduced leprechauns to Alistair (almost 2.5) and had rhyming text about kids trying to catch the leprechaun. I did not love it but it was good enough for this year. Next year I want to find something I like better. 19 book reviews: different' scenarios of children 's trying to catch a leprechaun while in their house. Sometimes hard to follow as you do not see much of the actual leprechaun. Some good St Patrick 's day activities mentioned. 20 book reviews: This is an adorable rhyming book for kids. It will be wonderful to use next year for my kindergarten students. I also should recommend it to Christie DeVore when she has her students build leprechaun traps. 21 book reviews: Picked up the How to Catch an Elf book for the kiddos back during the holidays and it was a big hit. I was looking for a fun way to celebrate St Patrick 's Day with them, so I picked this one up. I liked How to Catch an Elf a bit better, but still very cute. 22 book reviews: My youngest child (age 5) was really into leprechauns this past St. Patrick 's Day. This book was a great follow-up to having created her own leprechaun traps at school and at home. I think this would be a fun book to read to a preschool and/or kindergarten class. 23 book reviews: This book is so cute! My son loved the drawings and me explaining how the Leprechaun escaped all the traps the kids made! This book is definitely going into my sons little library so we have it on hand to read and read again. 24 book reviews: This is a neat little book where the author follows the trail of a leprechaun to see how the kids are doing in their attempt to trap him. The illustrations are colorful and fun. Kids will enjoy this one. Recommended for Grades K-1. 25 book reviews: Seems designed to sell an \"Elf on the Shelf\" type of holiday item. Rhyming text felt too forced & commercialized to me. 26 book reviews: Really liked this as a follow-up to the book we read last week. Read with PreK and Kindergarten. 27 book reviews: A fun read that will surely get kids thinking about the perfect leprechaun trap! 28 book reviews: How to Catch a Leprechaun is one of the many books in the How to Catch book series. This one in particular is the #1 New York Times and USA Today bestseller for St. Patrick 's Day. With that being said, I think this book is an excellent choice to read aloud to an elementary level class around St. Patrick 's Day. Throughout the book, the little leprechaun goes around town destroying people 's houses while the children create traps in an attempt to catch him. Spoiler alert... the leprechaun is too quick for all of them. I personally enjoy picture books that rhyme, and this book is full of rhyming! Plus, the illustrations are very clear, vivid, and detailed, down to creases in shoes and lines on a wooden table. I love reading this book to younger children and have used it over and over for multiple assignments. The kids have always seemed to enjoy it and wonder who or what will catch the Leprechaun at the end!  29 book reviews: I am not at all impressed. I guess it 's funny & the rhyme is catchy? And the message that the next aspiring engineer or scientist might actually create an effective trap is a good one.... But I found that I wanted to see more of the wee man actually navigating the traps... or more characterizations like the frustrated dad... something less superficial. This had the impact of a commercial, not a real book, imo.  Do not talk down to kids; they deserve your best work.  ",
    " Life Force: How New Breakthroughs in Precision Medicine Can Transform the Quality of Your Life & Those You Love": "book reviews: I am a big fan of Tony 's and have read all of his previous books. The book 's topics are highly relevant and something every person should educate themselves on. That said, the book does come across as highly biased.  I have given the book just three stars as I simply do not find it trustworthy when the vast majority of the supposedly largest breakthrough technologies in healthcare all happen to be companies that the authors have invested in.  The majority of the remaining technologies that the authors did not invest in are such big and well-known breakthroughs that a book of this type ignored them without losing credibility (CRISPR etc).  This means that either 1) the selection of technologies is not completely merit-based, or 2) that Tony is an even better investor than he is a coach. The more likely scenario is that his selection of technologies reflect his portfolio, which is a shame because the idea of a book to share the largest healthcare breakthroughs in layman terms is very admirable.  The biases aside, the book does cover many important topics, and it brings home the most important point: you are the CEO of your own health! Do not neglect the education in this essential field.  1 book reviews: What I liked: Good intro to wide range of tech/science esp in relation to genetics and ageing Inspiration in last two chapters that you d expect  What I didn t like: Large tracts of bold text on almost every page Sometimes felt like reading a list of Wikipedia entries stitched together Way too much promotion of self serving business interests  2 book reviews: When a motivational speaker writes a book about medicine without having a clue, the result is embarrassing. For example:  \"In aggressive brain tumors, for example, surgeries are often out of the question. Why? Because, as scientists explain, conventional chemotherapies are pretty much useless since they re blocked by the blood-brain barrier, a border wall of specialized cells designed to contain infections.\"  \"Have you heard of peptides, those bioactive molecules that build lean muscle mass and revitalize sexual desire and function in both men and women ? Surprisingly, they re modeled after mini-proteins found in common foods and their safety profile is outstanding.\"  Lasers \"work by delivering energy to the body through light photons, which encourages self-repair... laser therapy has the unique ability to ignite and regenerate the body, just as plants absorb the UV rays of the sun and convert photon energy into chemical energy.\"  \"There are many different varieties of cancer immunotherapy. But they re all built on the same earth-shaking idea: The immune system can eliminate cancer . It s hard to overstate how jaw-dropping this is.\"  \"The proteins your genome codes for at birth are the very same they code for when you are 80 years old!\"  \"He told Dr. Gusella that he was going after the Alzheimer s disease gene, beta-amyloid.\"  Grammar error abound too, e.g. \"... claims that HBOT may have regenerative anti-aging effects and effects on longevity is understandable.\"  3 book reviews: Ok folks! This one is a game changer in personal health management. I highlighted notes in each chapter with new technologies and new treatments for everything from Coronary Heart Disease to Type Two Diabetes and Osteoarthritis. Robbins takes us through a pile of data giving us ideas on achieving better health today. I went in as a skeptic and came out a hopeful believer with a game plan to heal and improve my strength, my back flexibility, the method I use to work out, my nutrition and limit my risks for disease. Whew! Highly Recommended!  4 book reviews: I had been looking forward to this book but was disappointed. I really enjoyed Tony Robbins s Money book, but this one is inflated with emerging biotech and half-truths, non-proven methods, and some confusing anecdotes of situations I find hard to believe as ever happening. I would consult your doctor before this book 100% of the time. 5 book reviews: I am a big fan of Tony Robbins and have been since the late 80 's. This work however, is a major disappointment. Let me explain why:  1. If you stay well informed on functional medicine with podcasts like MHS, Peter Attia, Andrew Huberman etc then you know lots of the stuff in this book.  2. The overwhelming majority of advise in these chapters point at solutions products and services that the author owns or invests in. He admits it but that does not dismiss it IMO. The book is an infomercial.  3. The cost of the treatments and protocols offered in this book must exceed affordability for nearly every person reading the book. If summed up, I am guessing we are talking well over six figures to approach these 'cures'.  4. Robbins himself ironically seems to have had many of these terrible afflictions in his own life (or the life of his wife or close friends). By the sounds of it, he 's heard more dire news from doctors than any man alive. Not sure I can believe it.  5. Trust in FDA approval, VACCINES, traditional doctors and mRNA shots poison the legitimacy of some suggested solutions. We have seen enough failure of these sources since 2020 that the authors reliance on them as credentialed particpants gives me huge pause.  Much as I have gained from Tony Robbins in the past this is a book I wish I got my time back for, just not worth it.  6 book reviews: Tony Robbins, Peter Diamandis, MD, and Robert Harris, PH.D did a phenomenal job at putting together a comprehensive medical book outlining new approved, or nearly approved treatments using sometimes simple and sometimes complicated cutting edge technology to treat all sorts of ailments. This is a book of 700 pages and is more easily used as a reference guide. There is a comprehensive index in the back of the book allowing us to easily find almost any disease, it seems, as well as new treatments.  This is a great book to have at home, and hopefully there will come a time we can cure anything using some of these technologies.  7 book reviews: This book is on the cutting edge.

I have read many Tony Robbin 's books, been to a UPW event, and love his message. Here 's the thing though...  The era of the aggressive upsell is over. Do none of TR 's people ever tell him that the relentless selling is gross? This book is much like a UPW, with great energy, lots of useful info, then wham - step right up with your checkbook folks.  The book was not bad, do not get me wrong. I enjoyed learning about the new and exciting medical technologies and practices. I found myself wanting more - and that 's after reading a 700 page book, which is strange.  By wanting more, I mean wanting more nuts and bolts actionable items. It felt like a lot of the chapters were \"hey look at this cool thing; should be coming out in the next 5 years; end of chapter\" OR \"hey look at this cool thing; .... end of chapter\".  I also felt like the pushing of his company was a little heavy in this one... \"Here is a cool thing... come to the FountainofLife to get it done.\" It was a 700 page advertisement in that regard.  I love his books on investing, this one was a step down from those in my opinion.  9 book reviews: I almost didn t read this book it looked like a fluffy hype book from Tony Robbins, encouraging me to tap into my inner life force power or something. But a friend I respect told me to read it and I m so glad. This wasn t fluff at all. This was full of real science with real changes to my life.  30 years ago the fastest growing area of technology and science was in computing. We went from big slow machines to faster and more powerful machines create a crazy exponential curve. The current area that is experiencing a wild growth curve like this is biology. Most especially, biology that is helping us live healthier for longer.  There are treatments happening right now that can deal with the most problematic of our illnesses. So if you or your loved ones or struggling with any major health issues, this book could change your life. The stuff that is happening in here is so new and happening so quickly the doctors who graduated from medical school even five years ago would not know this exists. So, asking your doctor would not help most of us actually find these answers.  But the most exciting part of the book for me was not just life-changing treatments for common problems, it was all the treatments and tools for putting energy back into our life and extending the years that we can feel young and vibrant. It is a real possibility for us to live past 120 while I am feeling energetic and having adventures. It is in the edge of possible that we could make it to 150 or beyond. And if that sounds crazy to you, then you need to read this book and learn the real science that is happening right now that makes this a conservative estimate. Don t miss out just because your doctor went to medical school 20 years ago and doesn t know the stuff. This is a book everyone should read.  One practical note: it s a very long book and that can be intimidating, but you don t have to read each section in full. You can pick the portions that are relevant to you and just read them.  10 book reviews: I usually love Tony Robbins but this book was terrible. I had to make myself finish it. If you want to learn more about how to live a \"longer more extraordinary life\" by hearing about all of the companies that the author 's have invested in, and the website for the company that they promote throughout the book, then this book is for you. Same some precious time and just read the 2 pages at the back of the book that list the 7 things you should implement in your life and you will get the gist of the book.  11 book reviews: Snake oil salesmen 12 book reviews: This weighty tome is mostly a general information health book with a touch of transhumanism, written in the motivational and conversational style characteristic of Tony Robbins. A mishmash of information about new medical developments and technology that sums up publicly available information from MDs and scientists with little original information or advice. The book does not flow easily and it is also full of references to the many products and devices being marketed by the author.  : Knowledge is power when it comes to our health.

Foods that cause inflammation are: refined carbohydrates, processed meats and fried foods. .  : Obesity raises the risk of multiple diseases: stroke, cancer, asthma and Alzheimer s disease. The real culprit of the obesity and diabetes epidemic is our food environment. The food environment is a powerful predictor of how we eat. Refined carbohydrates cause spikes in blood sugar that raise insulin levels and high levels of insulin push the body to store calories as fat. .  : When trying to understand what goes wrong in Alzheimer s it s helpful to think of this disease as a plumbing problem. The brain contains amyloid and tau. But it only becomes a problem when the pipes get stopped up. Most of the body 's waste materials get swept away by our lymphatic system. But in the brain, buffered by the blood brain barrier, it 's the cerebrospinal fluid. .  :  - is of a vital importance.

The fact that Tony Robbins fixed his rotator cuff with stem cells in 3 days without surgery and rehab is hard to believe, but I guess it 's where things are going and we will see with time.  As someone who is dealing with a herniated disc, I have asked several surgeons about this who have all been telling me that it works great for joins & tendons, but there is not enough evidence for herniations yet.  Anecdotely, I have a friend who has a microdiscectomy that re-herniated and was planning on getting a second one. He decided to try out stem cells, and though he had no results for 3 months, he later woke up one day and was completely healed.  2.  The last couple of chapters, narrated by Tony himself, are timeless. Everything related to attitude, gratitude and mindfulness is timeless, and I think I will grow to appreciate it more and more every time I listen to it. At the time of writing this, I plan to listen back to those last two chapters every couple of years.  3.  Most of the center of the book is more a reference than anything that 's SUPER captivating or exciting. I have heard a lot of the concepts in various podcasts, but still managed to learn a lot of new things. I think it 's worth listening to but would not call it a must. Knowing the chapter names and using it as a reference is worth it.  ---  The only thing that bothers me a bit, which was raised to me by a friend, is that Tony does have a vested financial interest in a lot of the companies and products he touted. He discloses all of his investments but sometimes says, \"This product is unlike any other, and that is why I decided to invest.\" There was a product (whose name now escapes me) related to using ultrasound to help with pain. Upon searching for a clinic that supports this, I learned it 's extremely proprietary technology only available in one clinic in the US. He made it sound like a commonplace medical procedure, which felt misleading.  14 book reviews: What I like: it gives ideas of what you could be possible with technology and science for treating diseases and improving our health very soon. Exciting and if you or a family member/friend has a chronic condition/disease (take Parkinson s for example) it s worth reading this to see if some of the outlined are possible. Mainstream local healthcare will not have these or even know about them more than likely. The book is 1000% right that you have to be the CEO of your own health. You have to plan and invest in it yourself.  What I don t: you have to take this stuff with a grain of salt. Most of the studies outlined are not very well done. If it seems iffy, you have to dig deeper on how quality of a study it is. Some of this can be more on the side of pseudoscience as well. I get there s so much to cover in a book like this but in some cases more info on the full story or downsides, needs to be presented.  15 book reviews: It s interesting that we have all the tools available to live longer, healthier lives thanks to so many scientific advances. Yet, at the same time, the food that s readily accessible is what s exposing us us to what afflicts us.  Also a little concerning that Tony has used and invested in so many of the companies mentioned, but he hasn t been  cured.  He seems to deal with more nagging illness and pain than I do, and I just live a normal life.  Anyway, as always, we re our own worst enemies. We all know what we should eat and not eat, but we continue to make bad choices.  16 book reviews: I have always enjoyed Tony Robbins books. Life force is a different then his other books. His books are normally about financial topics. This book was about health and break though medical technology. It focused on alternative medicine other than surgery or medication. I personally have taken up some of his suggestions and took many notes. This is truly an excellent book! It is long but so worth it. 17 book reviews: Once you get past the internal marketing, Tony provides a lot of insight to current and potential health breakthroughs. We create the future. If you are not interested in the science progress, the book does provide some extra tips (if you were not already aware of them) of lifestyle habits and choices that does drastically enhance, and for some - change, your health for the better. He 's not fibbing about cutting out the sugars. Just that one step brings invaluable results!  Thank you for all the information you provided Tony. May you continue to share your energy, passion, and be a guiding light within our world.  18 book reviews: What Robbins does well in this book is to bring together in one place health breakthroughs. But sadly, the book is full of way too many sloppy errors for me to give it over three stars. 19 book reviews: In a lot of ways this book reads like a commercial for all the companies the authors are invested in but there is a lot of valuable information on new technologies and treatments. The last two chapters are classically awesome Tony Robbins motivation strategies. 20 book reviews: What if the reason I d been successful so quickly was that I was destined to die young?

As I d learned from Ginny s triumph over cancer, nobody has a monopoly on medical wisdom.  And I said,  The other doctor said I have to have surgery and now you re telling me I have to have drugs.  And this beautiful man said with a smile and a twinkle in his eyes,  Tony, you re right. The butcher wants to butcher. The baker wants to bake. The surgeon wants to cut. And I m an endocrinologist, so I want to give you a drug. But here s the thing: We ll just have more certainty if you take the drug.  And I responded,  But we can t be certain about all the side eects of this drug, either. There s no sign of any current issues with my heart, and I ve obviously had this condition since I was a teenager. What if I just did nothing?

In a perfect world, Bob said, we d be calling in the cavalry from the most abundant source of fresh stem cells: the placenta, after a healthy birth.  He knew of a clinic in Panama that had permission to treat patients with the next best thing to placental cells: high-quality stem cells from umbilical cords.  $10,000 up to $25,000. Knees or ankles or elbows could often be treated for as little as $5,000, but my rotator cuff was a lot more involved. Though I trusted Bob explicitly, I had a moment of sticker shock:  Up to twenty-ve thousand dollars, are you kidding me?   Then I did what I do in these situations. I evaluate the risk-reward proposition.  Bob left Cornell and founded Lifebank USA, which used patented technology to harvest and test and preserve cord blood and placental stem cells in nitrogen-cooled freezers. The service was oered to new parents who wanted to  deposit  the stem cells of their newborn. Those stem cells may be used in the future to regrow organs or repair damage. Talk about a rainy-day account!  pluripotent stem cells. What does pluripotent mean? These are cells that can develop into almost any tissue or organ: skin or brain, heart or bones, lungs or pancreas or bladder. By contrast, cord blood stem cells  extracted from umbilical cord blood can dierentiate only into dierent types of blood cells.  Bob took this information and built a startup called Anthrogenesis. Then he merged it with Celgene, the world s largest biotechnology company. Over the next seven years, as Bob ran Celgene s cellular therapeutics division, he uncovered more about cellular medicine s potential to treat diabetes, Crohn s disease, skin wounds and burns  After the second day s treatment, I had what s often called a  cytokine response.

Fountain Life, has set out to create an unassailable standard for healthspan optimization from scratch. Our mission rests on three pillars:   The first is diagnostics. By leveraging the latest technology, you ll see what s happening inside your body while any problem is still manageable, before it becomes a major challenge. (More on this in our next chapter.)   The second pillar is all about performance. Whether you re a professional athlete, an everyday workout end, or a weekend warrior, Fountain Life can guide you toward a practical plan to become your best self in body and mind, with maximum vitality!   The third pillar is the latest in regenerative treatments, personalized to your diagnostics and performance goals and how they fit together.

I have to admit, I used to fall into the second category. What if they nd something small and overreact, making a mountain out of a medical molehill? Sticking your head in the sand isn t the answer.  Ignoring a problem, or not even being aware of it in the first place, doesn t mean it doesn t exist. Ask yourself: Would you rather know about an issue early on, when treatment is effective, easy, and cheap? Or much later on when you have few options for effective treatments?

It is not a deep dive into the subjects, but enough to give you a starting point to explore. And some can be done in the comfort of your own home.

IMO there was simply too much that was: \"almost ready for market\" or \"should be ready by the time this book is out!\" \"Should be available for widespread use in the next 3-5 years\" all the way down to the nonsense of \"given this person 's track record, you should count on this being a reality in no time!\" All that, and maybe I am just too early of an adopter, but he also promoted his website \"lifeforce.com or fountainlife.com\" as having all the answers in one place and a place to stay up to date on everything talked about in this book. As of right now, they are nearly empty websites that feel like a sophomore IS major put together and never followed up on. They are just not informative, or useful, and most of the links take you to a survey that asks for your information and a promise that you will be contacted as soon as things are up and running. I hope that they actually become useful tools, but as of right now, they are almost worthless.  25 book reviews: There is not a recommendation in this book that wo not cost you an arm and a leg to try. I agree with others that it reads as an infomercial and the bold text every four lines drove me to distraction, but my main issue is this is clearly a book for the very privileged few. I am glad I only borrowed it from the library rather than forking out any of my hard-earned. 26 book reviews: It 's amazing how a you make a best seller nowadays.

    " Little Blue Truck's Valentine": "book reviews: I think I m addicted to the   little blue truck  series of books for children .. In this story, told in rhyme, little blue truck delivers specially made Valentines to all of his farm animal friends. On the way home he begins to feel sad - no one has given him a Valentine. But there is a surprise waiting for him when he arrives home!  Young children will enjoy this story about kindness and friendship! Perfect for Valentine s Day!    1 book reviews: 3.5 STARS It 's one of the better Little Blue Truck sequels -- the variety of valentines is nice and many children will be drawn to the pretty designs (including foil accents). 2 book reviews: Little Blue Truck is the sweetest. I love reading about his adventures! Happy Valentines Day everyone   3 book reviews: This is a children 's book I read to my twin boys. I found this book to be cute and to have a have important message. My boys loved this book a lot. They loved all the valentines cards, and they also love the Little Blue Truck. This is a cute and fun valentine 's read. 4 book reviews: My grandsons love the Little Blue Truck books and I love to give them to them! All the parts that make a great book for preschool aged kids are there rhythm, rhyme, brightly colored illustrations, familiar animals and settings, and in this particular episode, a sweet lesson on giving and thoughtfulness. I look forward to the next Little Blue Truck story. 5 book reviews: Little Blue Truck was on his way, delivering cards on Valentine s Day.   Blue felt happy, for, truth to tell he hoped he d get some cards as well.  6 book reviews: I really hope this book honors the relationship between blue and toad that is obvious. 7 book reviews: I enjoyed the pictures more than the rhymes. 8 book reviews: Little Blue Truck delivers valentines to his friends.  My two year-old gives this book 5 stars. 9 book reviews: Again I am reviewing a toddler s book but something needs to be said! This book is beautiful and well made but doesn t have the essence of Little Blue Truck at all. For starters, all the animals can speak in complete sentences now instead of just Moo! It has a bad moral of the story: give gifts as long as you expect to receive some in return. Honestly thinking about returning it because I don t want my daughter actually learning from this.  10 book reviews: I received an electronic ARC from HMH Books for Young Readers through Edelweiss+. Little Blue Truck delivers valentines to friends and hopes to get some in return. Sadly, no one gives Blue a card along the way. A huge surprise waits at home - all his friends have gathered to wish him Happy Valentines Day. Toddlers and Preschoolers love Little Blue Truck, and this story will delight them as well. The illustrations show the energy and love surrounding the characters.  11 book reviews: This is frequently read in our home, a favorite of both parents and children. There are five aspects I admire about this book:  FIRST - the rhyming flows effortlessly. I really enjoy reading this one aloud because it has a cadence that is consistent beginning to end. Word choice is fun and makes a delightful story.  SECOND - I enjoy the honesty of Little Blue at the beginning where it is revealed that he hopes to receive valentine cards on this special day. Who doesn t? There is a hint that he is giving cards so that he will receive some. However, I think that is negated by my next point.  THIRD - Little Blue shows that he cherishes his friendships and that he knows his friends. For he has gotten the perfect valentine cards for each of his friends. This shows he put a lot of thought and effort into each card and how it would be received by his friends. He also personally delivers the cards showing his willingness to meet his friends where they are.  FOURTH - I like that the story acknowledges the emotions of hope at the beginning, the joy of delivering the cards, and the sadness of not getting any cards along the way. I think it a good lesson that shows the ups and downs of emotions.  FIFTH - Is more of a question, what about the Toad? I ve only read three Little Blue Truck stories (as of the writing of this) so there may be backstory I m unaware of between Toad and Little Blue. Toad doesn t get a card, but seems to be a key member of how the story ends.  I recommend this book to all. Enjoy a book that depicts true friendship.  12 book reviews: LITTLE BLUE TRUCK'S VALENTINE is a sweet holiday read that follows Little Blue and friends on Valentine 's Day. Little Blue Truck has made the perfect valentines for all his friends, and he spends his day giving them out to friends. As he heads home, he is sad that no one has given him any cards. When he gets home, he finds a special Valentine 's Day surprise with all his friends!  What I loved: This is another fun installment in the Little Blue Truck series that celebrates Valentine 's Day and good friends. The book includes great, colorful illustrations and rhyming text along with the familiar celebrated characters. Extra features include foil on the valentines throughout to add some extra visual interest, and a lift-the-flap for when Little Blue arrives home to the surprise, revealed under the flap. This is perfect for holiday celebrations with little ones.  The font is clear and easy to read throughout, and the large, thick pages will work perfectly for little fingers to turn and enjoy on their own. The flap is a full page size and attached firmly, which will work well for tougher readers.  What left me wanting more: As a small thing, some of the phrases are a little awkward and tongue-twisty - a slight challenge when reading aloud.  Final verdict: Enjoy Valentine 's Day with Little Blue as he visits his friends and shares special valentines. LITTLE BLUE TRUCK'S VALENTINE is a delightful holiday read to enjoy with little ones.  13 book reviews: We are big fans of Little Blue Truck here! My nephews request these books often and then love looking on the back and asking for the other books pictured! If we read one, we have to read them all! I m so glad they love Little Blue because I do, too! This new offering is no different. I was saddened to learn the original illustrator had passed. But the new  ghost illustrator  (is that the proper term?) is fantastic. This Valentine s book has the same easy rhyming we ve come to expect and the illustrations are great! The emotions a picture of a truck can convey is amazing! Poor Little Boue Truck feels lonely when he doesn t receive a Valentine. And my nephews were so worried for him. Fortunately, this book had a happy ending!  14 book reviews: READ MORE HERE: https://amzn.to/3DOhNUx  \"Little Blue Truck 's Valentine\" is a heartwarming and adorable children 's book.

This book is a wonderful addition to any child 's Valentine 's Day book collection.  READ MORE HERE:  15 book reviews: Like the other Little Blue Truck books, this one has bright happy illustrations and bouncy rhyming text that is great fun to read aloud. Little Blue Truck is delivering all of his homemade valentines to his friends on Valentines Day. Each of is as unique as its recipient - a polka dot egg-shaped card for hen, one that floats for duck and one almost as big as horse with a horseshoe on the front. There is even something special waiting for Little Blue Truck at the end of his trip. The bright colors and animals will appeal to even the youngest story time audience and the size of this book is large enough to read to a group, and lovely enough to read to a youngster cuddled into a lap.  16 book reviews: If you enjoyed the other Little Blue Truck stories you will like this one as well. Easy flow and pleasing rhymes accompany bright and cheery pastoral illustrations. Little Blue is a kind friend, he delivers personalized Valentine s cards to each of his friends. The friends return blues kindness with a big surprise. A good story to read with a discussion of kindness towards one another and including friends. 17 book reviews: I was talking neighbor this week who sent her daughter to school with a box full of Valentines to give to people who looked like they had not gotten any. Which, I felt, was an interesting contrast to this book and why I felt the way I did.  It 's not a bad book. But, again, the moral is semi-appropriate for the target age group and not at all great for adults. We do not do nice things because we want something. We do nice things because it 's the right thing to do.  18 book reviews: I love the little blue truck series, with its upbeat rhymes and adorable illustrations of an old blue pickup truck. In this story, he is delivering Valentine cards. It 's a good read for Valentines.  Although, after reading it to kids, I might explain that sometimes people who give cards do not get cards in return. And that 's ok. Sometimes it 's nice to be kind even if you do not get anything back in return.  19 book reviews: Little Blue Truck delivers Valentines to all of his friends, but is sad when it seems he has not received even one. Tenderhearted littles will be as pleased as Little Blue to discover a surprise waiting for him back in the barn.  A great read for the littles at storytime. This series is also popular with my newly independent readers. Simple rhyming text and shiny Valentines will keep their attention for this quick read.  20 book reviews: I received this ARC from the publisher through Edelweiss+ in exchange for an honest review.  This is a sweet addition to the Little Blue Truck. The rhyme scheme of these books can best be described as rollicking, and this one does not disappoint. Little Blue Truck is off to deliver his Valentine 's Day cards, and hoping he will receive a few in return along the way.  21 book reviews: Little Blue Truck books are a big hit where I teach! This book shows Little Blue giving out Valentin 's Day Cards to all of his friends all while Little Blue is secretly hoping for a card for himself. When Blue thinks no one left him a card, it shows kids how others feel when they get left out. It also shows kids how doing nice things like giving Valentine 's Day cards makes everyone happy. 22 book reviews: This book is adorable! If you re a  Little Blue Truck  fan then you will adore this sweet Valentine s Day read. Little Blue has to deliver valentines cards to all his friends and he hopes he will get one as well.

Kids will surely enjoy this book! 23 book reviews: Such a cute book! We loved it! The story follows the Little Blue Truck as he delivers Valentines to all his friends! As he goes home, he is sad that he never received any Valentines but he is very surprised when he gets home to his garage. A wonderful Valentine 's Day story for kids of all ages. The illustrations are bright and colorful and make the book a wonderful story! 24 book reviews: I bought this book for Jack for Valentine 's Day because he loves the other books in this series.  He sat on the couch with me and listened to most of it this morning, but he did take breaks to do his neighborhood watch duties. We read it again later, and he seems to like it. I think it 's incredibly sweet, but I am more a softy than he is. 25 book reviews: I do not know whose more addicted to The Little Blue Truck series my daughter or myself but it 's definitely a favorite of both of ours. I picked up the Valentine 's sequel as a gift for Valentine 's Day to my baby girl and it 's quickly a favorite now. The rhymes are really nice in this one and the little cards inside the book are beautiful too. 26 book reviews: This is my favorite Little Blue Truck book.

Valentine s Day might be over but this book is still being requested multiple times a day. 28 book reviews: Loved this sequel to the little blue truck. In this book, he is delivering valentines to all his friends but will he receive any. The pictures are catchy and his worries are evident. Read to see if he receives any. 29 book reviews: Little Blue Truck is delivering just right Valentine 's for all his friends on the farm. But will someone give Little Blue a Valentine?  A cute story in rhyme for Valentine 's day. I like how the Valentine 's were individualized for each animal. The rhyme was well done, too. ",
    " Llama Llama I Love You": "book reviews: Llama Llama Valentine 's Day Edition  Dewdney really has a knack for rhythm and for expressing quite a lot with few and simple words. This was especially evident coming directly after the incomprehensible-to-babies My First Prayer Book.

    " Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History": "book reviews: A way to deal with the unspeakable that makes it even more disturbing and weird.  Using animals for certain nations is a balancing act It s still a great work, but maybe all the same animals of one species would have been an even better choice. Not just because it would have been ideal to show that they re all the same, just different, let 's say with dogs or cats and many breeds, but because it s just an unnecessary point of criticism that could have easily been avoided. It 's petty and art is free, but some nations might not find it that great to be associated with certain animals.  Definitively nothing for kids or even some adults It s just too hardcore, by using anthropomorphized animals and the art of painting, it gets even worse and kind of more graphic. But the impact and mind blowing factor are amazing, because it s  Much more memorable that way than in general anti war productions Because people are used to war movies, games, satires, pictures, etc., which creates a kind of habituation effect and deadening, but this is something different and more tangible. Each page screams out the terror, the underlying themes are the sickest possible for even the most murderous apes on the planet, and one will never forget the associations between the pictures and reality itself.  It could be used for visualizing other atrocities too There have been other genocides in colonial history without numbers of the people killed, starved to death, or infected with plagues and no real interest in redemption by giving back land to Native Americans of both Americas or historical revisionism. Let s say removing statues and street names of mass murderers in the US, just imagine this in Germany with nazi leaders and the swastika instead of slave trading warmongerers and the confederate flag. Impossible and unthinkable in Europe after WW2, but in the bible belt, it s totally fine more than 150 years after the American civil war. Even more disturbing is the 20th century history of Russia and China with numbers between dozens of millions up to 100 million people killed per country. Especially adapted to one country and its history, the Maus concept would have immense potential for opening minds and maybe even something like redemption and a real reappraisal of history besides political correct drivel, bigotry, and empty promises. The crazy and disturbing thing is that it would mean imprisonment or even death for the artists creating such works in many countries that are still developing or already full scale dictatorships, with advanced surveillance technologies making the police states seem too perfectly developed to ever fall. Because resistance and rebellion have become impossible.  Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:  1 book reviews: I am not a graphic novel reader for the most part. I have probably only ever read five or six, but if a book is going to be banned, I am going to read it to find out why. This is a book that is based on this Pulitzer prize winners own father. In the story the father, portrayed as a mouse, is telling his painful story to his son, who happens to be a graphic artist. It is a different and maybe a little less harrowing way to show the many abuses of the Holocaust. Less so because of the figures used and the form in which it is told.  A school in Tennessee seems to be banning this book that is on the eighth grade list. I have had seven children, now grown, and would have no problem with them reading this book. Eighth graders are already exposed to many worse things than this horrific historical event. Video games,, Facebook, snap chat to name a few. I do not agree with book banning in any way shape or form. What are these parents afraid of? I could offer my opinion, but wo not. This world is already bereft of understanding, empathy and sympathy, kindness. This book might elicit some.  They have proposed this after more than twenty years onto the bestsellers list. If you are a member of scribe there is a pdf that can be downloaded.  2 book reviews: 4.5   Very very very powerful and I like that you see the relationship between Spiegelman and his father throughout. 3 book reviews: I am extremely moved by this book, it is as relevant and important today as it was when it was first published over 30 years ago, possibly even more so.  Maus tells the story of Vladek Spielgeman, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust. His son, Art Spiegelman, is an illustrator and wants to write the story of his father 's experiences during World War II. The story is also of Art himself, the interviews and relationship with his father.  The story alternates between the present day interviews and shifts into the past through Vladek 's recollections. The illustrations are straightforward and in a black-and-white style.  I , it is a powerful and emotional story. I am starting the second volume right away.   below is what I found to be one of the most powerful scenes in the book.   4 book reviews: A genuine work of Art (Spiegelman).  I purchased The Complete Maus a few weeks ago, but the first 200 pages destroyed me so completely that I have had to lay it down, probably forever. Still, it 's very easy to see why the book is considered such a classic. I only wish I would had to strength to finish it. 5 book reviews: The Maus books were just as incredible as promised. I was deeply moved by Spiegelman 's story about his father 's experiences in Poland and Auschwitz during World War II.  My ancestors are from Germany and my mother was a WWII buff -- our bookshelves at home were filled with hundreds of books about that war. When I asked her why she was so fascinated by that period, she said she was trying to understand how something like the Holocaust could have happened. Now I am an adult and I often read books about atrocities around the world. Even though they are depressing and soul-crushing, I guess I am also just trying to understand how people can do such horrible things.  But I digress. Despite having already read a great deal about WWII, one of the things I especially liked about the Maus books was hearing how Spiegelman 's father managed to survive. His father was gifted at quickly mastering skills and being able to talk his way out of tough situations. Those abilities helped him and his wife to survive the concentration camp.  Most reviews of Maus comment on Spiegelman 's choice to draw the races differently: Jews are mice, the Germans are cats and other Poles are pigs. I liked the minimalist drawings because it kept the story moving and the focus was more on the words and the meanings.  I think this is a significant memoir of the Holocaust and would highly recommend it.  6 book reviews: Too personal to be true, but it is true... It is awesome. The art is fantastic. Over all the story is so touching. This comic book is a journey, i recommend to anyone who does not know anything about the holocaust. 7 book reviews: This is one of those graphic novels that everyone is telling the world to read. Acclaimed as one of the best graphic novels out there. My take on it is that it was really enjoyable and informative, but not the best. While it was very enjoyable, I still had a few problems with it. Overhyped in my opinion, but still highly recommended for me.  I honestly have no problem with the plot. Straightforward and informative. I am a huge history fan, and the topic of Nazis in general was nothing new for me. It 's been a while since my last read of this certain part of history. This graphic novel was a good way to refresh my memory. It 's still very unsettling that the Nazis were this abusive back then. The way they tortured the Jews and such was very inhumane. I know that somewhere in the world today, people are still being abused like this, if not worse. Such a shame, and quite unthinkable how some people could be this cruel.  The characters were not as amazing as I wanted them to be. Some were not developed enough. I seem to have this problem with most of the graphic novels that I read. I am not sure if it 's the graphic novels itself, or the way the author describes them. The whole character thing is a huge problem for me to be honest, because i am a reader who heavily depends on the characters for enjoyment. I like a well written set of characters. The plot thankfully made up for the not so great characters. Artie and Anja were really enjoyable, but the other ones felt a bit dull.  One more problem that I encountered would be the artwork. I am very choosy when it comes to the artwork. I know this aimed to provide a historical feeling, but it did not work that much for me. I did not like the rough drawing and the way it was presented. It could have been done better. Not a huge problem, but still something that bugged me from time to time.  4/5 stars. It 's a solid 4 for me. Hopefully the next volume would continue to be this good, or be even better. I am going to rate the compilation of the two volumes separately after reviewing the second one. Great way to introduce history to aficionados and also beginners. Highly recommended.  8 book reviews: Extraordinary..... If there was a Pulitzer Prize for the BEST ALREADY winners of the Pulitzer .....Art Spieglman 's books would be a very high contender.  Point is... The creation of Maus exceeds expectations... which you might have heard through the grapevine.  Maus, Vol 1: \"My Father Bleeds\"....is painful, personal, brilliant ..,and needs to be experienced first hand...( as all his books do).... Then we might have a discussion  still worse to come, is Vol 2. \"My Trouble Begins\"      9 book reviews: I do not read much Holocaust Literature nowadays.  In my teens and twenties, I read everything I could get my hands on on the Third Reich and the Middle Ages, as I had an abnormal urge to seek out the darkness in human souls. I was repelled and at the same time, fascinated by it - like people drawn irresistibly towards gruesome road accidents.  As I matured, this urge to torture myself diluted, and I moved on towards more wholesome stuff. However, I decided I would make an exception with because of one important reason - it is a comic, or to use the more accepted terminology nowadays, a graphic novel.  The comic is a seriously underutilised narrative format. Like the fairy tale and the animated movie, Disney has corrupted it and confined it to a corner where it can only babble and make baby talk. It is heartening to see it breaking out of that straitjacket and maturing - in books like and the this one.  --------------------------------------------------------------    Dehumanising the enemy is the first step towards eliminating them: which is what Hitler tried to do with Jews and nearly succeeded. In this book, Art Spiegelman tells us a story from that dark era - a very personal one, that of his father - yet distances us emotionally brilliantly by using Brechtian techniques. The Jews are portrayed as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs and Americans as dogs.  The story is delivered brutally, pulling no punches. However, changing the characters into animals accomplishes two things - by taking away the individuality, we are forced to look at the big picture: and the race differences are emphasised so as to be insurmountable(a Jew and a Gentile are both human beings, but a mouse can never become a cat). So even when we are caught up in the story, the political subtext is never forgotten.  A brilliant, brilliant work.  BTW, a bigger review is up on my .  10 book reviews: Actual rating 4.5 stars. I am generally not a fan of WWII stories. All the ones I ve read lean so much into depicting Hitler and his army.  This is not that kind of story. It s about a man finding ways to survive in a world that wanted him dead.  I loved the personal moments between Art and his father. That balance of humour and relatability to the shock and tragedy helped me continue reading.  This is one of those stories I never thought I d read but I m glad I did. It s incredible to read about this tale of survival in this medium.  11 book reviews: It 's hard to review a book which covers such dark history and suffering. This is a unique way to bring this subject to light but no less painful than say Night or Schindler 's List. The graphic novel style did help the subject matter be more digestible but I still found myself having to set it down and walk away to deal with the horrors being shared. Despite the comic style, the author did an amazing job in showing the humanity both in the cruelty but also in the hope. I feel the art lent to the story.  This is something we should never, ever let fade in our memory.  12 book reviews: It just did not do what I wanted.  I had high expectations, my friends, I had high expectations. That might not be fair, but there you go.  My biggest problem was the misused animals. The book is called Maus. The characters are mice and cats and pigs. BUT NONE OF THEM ACT LIKE MICE OR CATS OR PIGS. WHATS THE POINT? In conversation with my friend Barry* it came up that \"It 's just cats chasing mice. That 's the extent of the metaphor.\" He disagrees, on the whole.. he actually quite enjoyed this (we are budding reading again, I never want to stop buddy reading with this boy), but regardless he saw my point of view. I feel that there was great potential to use the animal characteristics to do interesting and inventive things, but basically they are just humans that look like animals.  I have a few other issues: I do not like the way the son treats the father (that wo not make sense unless you have read this, sorry), and I have not really been able to feel emotionally attached to anything (apart, of course, from the normal sense of sadness that comes from thinking of the holocaust).  It 's not terrible, by any means. The illustrations are interesting, the story is interesting, and I flew through it. I very much look forward to reading Volume II, but this just was not good enough.  *Barry: !  13 book reviews: When I was a kid I read comic books (mostly Superman). The Maus books are the only graphic novels I have read and I consider them masterpieces (Mausterpieces?). Like Spiegelman 's alter ego, I was a middle class child growing up in Queens (NYC), the son of Holocaust survivors and could not communicate with my father when I was growing up. He got it down perfectly. It was spot on and ranks among the best of Holocaust related literature. 14 book reviews: Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest   I did not intend for my first book of 2018 to be so depressing, but MAUS is such a creative, important book. In MAUS, Art Spiegelman uses the medium of graphic novel to tell the moving, and sometimes hair-raising story of his father, Vladek: a holocaust survivor from Poland.    Juxtaposed against scenes where a now middle-aged Art is chatting with his elderly father in his home in Queens are scenes of the gradual chokehold that that Nazis formed around what later became Nazi-controlled territories. Vladek Spiegelman married into wealth with his first wife, Anja, and their lives before the war were rather luxurious. Slowly that all dwindled as their predominately Jewish area became one of the ghettos, and they were forced to run and hide for many years, until at last, someone promising to smuggle them both into Hungary betrayed them to the Nazis, and they ended up at Auschwitz.    Even though this is told biography-style, MAUS reads as being a little surreal, the Jews are mice, the Nazis are cats, the neutral Poles are pigs, and the Americans of the present day are dogs. It was a really interesting choice stylistically, and I am not completely sure why he did it - maybe to remove the reader one step from the horrors contained within the comic? There 's a scene in here, one of the modern parts, about what happened when Vladek found a comic strip he did about his mother 's suicide, which is included as an excerpt. This comic, \"Prisoner on Planet Hell\" is done with real people, which adds an extra layer of surrealism: a mouse, writing memoir as a human.    If you are interested in WWII history and enjoy those \"literary\" graphic-novels that are about more weighty topics than capes and superheroes, I really recommend MAUS. Vladek is such an interesting man, and his firsthand account of survival is just that: firsthand. Really exceptional read.    4 to 4.5 stars  15 book reviews: This is a powerful story. It does not seem like these horrors could be possible and yet they are. This is a black and white comic with mice as Jews and cats as Nazis. I can only hope that this history remains a reminder of why compassion toward all people is so very important. When we lose our compassion, we lose our humanity. It is also a reminder of the darkness people are capable of and the strength of the human spirit. This is not a fun story or a comforting story; it is a tough story about survival and after you do survive, what is life like then. I am glad I read this story.  16 book reviews: Re-read September 5, 2015: I think I absorbed a lot more of the story and its power the second time around. It 's really wonderfully crafted, and I ca not wait to finally read the second volume because this one ends sort of abruptly.  First read January 3-9, 2014 17 book reviews: I admit, I have never been a fan of comics/graphic novels, and to my mind have only ever read two or three of them. I would been thinking of reading this for some time, and now was the time to get on with it. Dealing with the harrowing wartime experiences of his father, Vladek, a Polish Jew and survivor of Auschwitz, and Spiegelman 's troubled relationship with him, what we have here is a blend of biography, autobiography and memoir, cleverly told in the graphic novel format. Not wanting to overly dramatize Vladek 's story, Spiegelman presents it in a straightforward cartoon way, with Jews represented as mice, and Nazis as cats. This is a book meant for everyone, not just comic readers. The cartoon style and anthropomorphic characters allow the reader to approach otherwise horrific situations in a simple and direct way, without the use of realistically explicit images or melodrama, while still grabbing hold of the reader in a most power way. He tells the story dispassionately and honestly without any knowing winks to comics-literate readers. Nor does Spiegelman glamorise his father as some kind of hero. Vladek comes across as irritating, manipulative, exasperating, and even bigoted. He is simply trying to tell an important story, by documenting his father 's wartime experiences. I was surprised to find a little humour in there, something you would not associate with the Holocaust, but it is in there, albeit wry and situational. Maus has the power to take your breath away, with its stunning visual style, and sombre reminder that while we can never forget the Holocaust, we may need new ways to always remember. Essential reading.  18 book reviews: Maus means  mouse  in German; and part of what gives this graphic novel of the Nazi Holocaust its unique power is the way in which cartoon artist Art Spiegelman utilizes the cat-and-mouse metaphor to describe the struggle of European Jews to stay alive while being hunted by the Nazis. Spiegelman draws from real life, and from his own family history, in conveying the events of Maus   and somehow, the stylized nature of this graphic novel, which depicts its Jewish characters as mice and its Nazi characters as cats, causes the horrors of the Holocaust to come through in an innovative and moving way.  is , and the survivor referred to in that second element of the title is a real-life Holocaust survivor: Art Spiegelman s father Vladek. was published in two volumes, and this first volume has the subtitle   a powerful reference not only to the cruelty and violence of the Holocaust, but also to the way in which the Holocaust haunts those who managed to survive it.  This graphic novel moves back and forth between two worlds. One is a 1970 s  present,  set in the New York City neighborhood of Rego Park, Queens; there, Art Spiegelman, in a series of visits to his ill and aging father Vladek, tries to persuade Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences. The other is the 1930 s and 1940 s history of the Holocaust events that Vladek experienced and survived.  Within the context of Holocaust literature, what seems to give its unique power, as mentioned above, is its use of the cat-and-mouse metaphor. The Jews, in Spiegelman s work, are depicted as mice; the Nazis as cats; the non-Jewish people of Poland as pigs; and the Americans of modern New York as dogs. For the Nazi predators, the Jews are nothing but  prey    and because they cannot hope to prevail through physical force, the  mice  must use their wits to try to survive.  As begins, the reader at once gets a sense of a broken family with a traumatic history and a family dynamic characterized by emotional distance; Art Spiegelman writes that he and his father  weren t that close  and adds that  My Mother s suicide and his two heart attacks had taken their toll  (p. 11). Vladek Spiegelman, after the post-war suicide of his wife Anja, remarried, but his marriage to his second wife Mala is not a happy one. Against this backdrop of an unhappy family situation in a modern American setting, Vladek Spiegelman begins to recount his  survivor s tale  of the Holocaust.  The early chapters of set forth Vladek s early life in pre-war Poland, including his marriage to Anja, whose post-partum depression following the birth of their first child prompts the Spiegelmans to travel by train to a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia. In a small town on the way to the sanitarium, Vladek experiences a grim foretaste of what the future will bring:  It was the beginning of 1938   before the war   hanging high in the center of town, it was a Nazi flag. Here was the first time I saw, with my own eyes, the swastika  (p. 32). Art Spiegelman makes this panel larger than the others   five mice look fearfully through the train window, with the Nazi swastika flag looming outside the window, like a grim black harbinger at the top and center of the panel   using the graphic-novel format skillfully to reinforce the ideas that he is conveying.  Vladek, as he tells his story to Art, is drafted into the Polish Army as the Second World War begins, and is taken prisoner as the Polish forces fall before the Nazi Wehrmacht. Seeing that the Jews are separated from, and treated much more harshly than, the Polish prisoners, Vladek learns quickly the strategies for survival   speak German to the Nazis, volunteer when opportunities for work are offered, stand in the second line rather than the first   and eventually he is released from his P.O.W. confinement, and is able to rejoin his family in Sosnowiec.  Once Vladek is released, however, his struggle to survive, and to ensure his family s survival, continues on a new front. The Nazi measures against the Jewish population increase in intensity   all Jews are ordered into ghettos, and many Jews, such as the elderly, are taken away, never to be seen again. As Vladek recalls,  We didn t yet know of Auschwitz   of the ovens   but we were anyway afraid  (p. 86).  Chapter 5,  Mouse Holes,  features an early attempt by Art Spiegelman to cope with the trauma of his mother s suicide   an actual underground comics feature from 1973 called  Prisoner of the Hell Planet: A Case History,  in which he used stylized imagery and characters (albeit human beings rather than cats and mice) to convey the pain of learning that his mother had taken her own life. The black-bordered pages of this portion of the book -- similar to what one might see on a funeral notice -- emphasize how Art Spiegelman, like his father, is dealing with his own emotional pain and sense of bereavement; and the thin lines and sharp contours of this feature, in contrast with the thicker lines and more blurred contours of , emphasize the difference in time between the periods of history being dramatized.  Returning to the main line of narrative of , Vladek and a number of his family survive a selection process at the Sosnowiec stadium   of 30,000 people there, about one-third are chosen for work, while the remainder are consigned to extermination. When orders come that the Jews of Sosnowiec are to be sent to Auschwitz, some take their own lives; others build bunkers, below coal bins and above rooftops, in which to hide from the Nazis. These bunkers, set forth in great detail in larger panels, are some of the  mouse holes  in which Vladek and others attempt to hide from the Nazi genocide.  Precariously sheltered in the basement of the home of a Polish woman whose anti-Semitic husband does not know she is sheltering Jews, Vladek attempts to procure for himself and Anja an escape to Hungary, where things are said to be better than they are in Poland. Panels showing mice wearing pig masks convey the perilous process through which a Jewish person masquerades as a Pole in order to be able to circulate outdoors. But they are betrayed; and a large concluding panel shows them arriving at Auschwitz, where the gate bears that mocking inscription of ( Work Makes Free ). As Vladek puts it,  We came here to the concentration camp Auschwitz. And we knew that from here we will not come out anymore We knew the stories   that they will gas us and throw us in the ovens. This was 1944   we knew everything. And here we were  (p. 157).  The reader knows, of course   for this is a framed tale   that Vladek and Anja survive the Holocaust and the Second World War; and therefore the reader of is likely to want to go straight on to (with its subtitle ) to learn they survived. But there is one more shocking discovery to be made from this first volume of .  Throughout the book, Art Spiegelman has been searching through his father s house for his mother s diaries, in which she recounted Holocaust experiences; he feels that the content of the diaries will enrich his graphic novel, and the reader senses that he wants to reconnect with his beloved and lost mother as well. The ultimate fate of the diaries, and Art s response when he learns of what happened, causes to close on a disturbing note in both its present-day and past-time narratives.  We live in a time when increasing percentages of people, here in the United States and around the world, either don t know that the Holocaust happened, deny that the Holocaust occurred, or claim that reports about what happened during the Holocaust are somehow  exaggerated.  And has recently become the target of book-banners; a Tennessee school board recently voted unanimously to remove the novel from its 8th-grade language arts curriculum, citing concerns about nudity and profanity. It is heartbreaking to reflect upon how the members of this school board have acted as if curse words, or images of naked people, are somehow more \"obscene\" than the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis against six million innocent people between 1939 and 1945.  In such times as these, a work like   with its graphic-novel format that might reach those readers who would not be inclined to take up a more  conventional  work of Holocaust history or literature   becomes more vitally needed than ever. is one of the most important graphic novels ever created.  19 book reviews: What a masterpiece. I ca not believe it took me so long to read this. 20 book reviews: The story of a Jew 's survival.  Jews depicted as mice and Germans as cats. A poignant story. Really good, the character Vladek (the survivor). Can you imagine him on a German prisoners camp, a freezing Autumn, birds falling from trees due to cold...and Vladek taking a shower at the river: to stay clean and warmy the day onward? Or his wife (a mice too) complaining about rats!?...        UPDATE           21 book reviews: It hits you like a truck going twice the speed limit... 22 book reviews: When I switched my major to English in my senior year, I had a lot of back classes to take, especially intro classes with freshmen and sophmores, though my last intro class was a night class with primarily older women, who worked full time jobs in Edison or the Amboys and a bushel of kids waiting at home. Basically, they were there to learn more about literature, sort of as a self-improvement class for the non-literary. The class was taught by a flame hair TA, who had the personality to match. Yet as time went by, those last descriptive sentences I wrote became complete crap. We became a class of studious literary scholars on par with any graduate program. Our TA took on a Robin Williams in Dead Poet 's Society aura. Why, when did this happen? Well, we read Maus. It rocked all our socks. Besides our TA was a serious woman, not to mention awesome and intelligent. She used to write music reviews for the Village Voice when it was credible, and now she 's working with Art Speigelman and has a sexy fellowship at Harvard. And me what do I have? Well, I have this book. I thank her for the introduction.  23 book reviews: Still a masterpiece, as relevant as ever. Unfortunately. Maus always has been, actually, more about Art Spiegelman 's complex relationship with his father than it is *just* about the overwhelming trauma of the Holocaust.  In fact, utilizing the visual metaphor of funny animals is the most poignant way to humanize these characters. They are not just one group, they could be anyone. And yet it is self-aware how contradictory it is to relate different human 'races' to different animals.  Another thing (which is in the second volume) is that his father who is clearly a victim can also be racist. That 's the sad nature of humanity. Like is complex and terrible, it is what it is. Irreverent cartoons are the only appropriate way to express this.  And there 's the mother 's suicide, other issues with women, so much in this simple looking graphic novel. Every generation should continue to reread this tale of generational trauma...  24 book reviews: I do not read many graphic novels - at most 2 or 3 per year, and do not really appreciate the format - I find it difficult to read and look at the pix at the same time - but HAD to tackle this to 'honor' its recent banning by the TN. school board, on the grounds their students MIGHT find it 'upsetting'; I mean, g-d forbid the killing of 6 million innocents should disturb their tiny little brains any! {https://hyperallergic.com/708067/tenn...}  In a way, the story follows a known, typical template - how many variations on the horrible events of the Holocaust and survivor aftermaths can there really be? And. much like his son (the cartoonist 's doppelganger, Art), I found the character of the father Vladek to be irritating, with his Yoda-speak. But the story is certainly compelling - it is odd that it ends so abruptly, but on to part two.  25 book reviews: Some books will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Some will uplift your spirits. Some will even touch your heart. And some some have the power to rip your soul into tiny little pieces and leave nothing but a shell in its place.  Who knew a graphic novel could hold such power? But that s exactly what happened.     Having finished , I feel like I just sparred against a two-tonne elephant with no means of escape. Each hit was worse than the last until I reached the end feeling numb.  In this novel, Spiegelman s father recounts all his experience and near misses with death during Hitler s reign. He talks about his life before the war; his life as a successful businessman; how he found his wife and the birth of their son.  He then talks about the start of war and being recruited to fight on the front line. He talks about what he had to endure not only as war prisoner but a Jewish war prisoner. He manages to escape one nightmare only to be thrust back into another one. He witnesses/hears about the deaths of many of his friends and relatives until the cliffhanger at the end when he finally arrives at Auschwitz concentration camp.  I ve studied history, particularly German history throughout my childhood. I ve learnt key dates, facts and figures but that s all it is   facts and figures. Hitler became the leader of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei in 1921 and chancellor in 1933. After this time, Germany began to transform from a representative democracy under the Weimar Republic to a single-party dictatorship under the rule of Hitler. Then came the onslaught of his anti-semitic policies. Studying this period brought a sour taste in my mouth but reading this novel made everything more real. I felt like I was right there; in constant fear of what might happen if the Gestapo found me and not knowing if I would survive the next hour let alone the next day. The author does a brilliant job depicting each of these events. The Jews are illustrated as rats, the Poles as pigs   only willing to risk their lives to save the Jews if money was involved and the Germans as cats.  This novel is truly great at depicting the horrific events that happened during the Holocaust but it s not the only reason I would recommend it. This novel is also about a broken relationship between a father and son, and how they try to reconnect together after many years. It also shows the long-term effects a war can have on a person who endured so much in their life. It really puts things into perspective. The next time someone tells you how hard their life is. Tell them it could be worse.   This is completely different but this story also hit home a little. Although what my father s family went through is in no way proportional to what Spiegelman s father went through, I can t help but be saddened by the atrocities peppered throughout our history. What my father s family went through happened in the 1970s, when the Ugandan President decided to have an ethnic cleansing of all Indians from Uganda. My father and all his siblings were born and brought up there. My grandfather ran a large successful family business there and having listened to my father s story many times, he talked about how they were forced out of their businesses and homes. Everything they owned was reallocated to Ugandan nationals. He talked about how my uncle tried to save our belongings but was beaten to a pulp by the police. My dad talked about how they left with only the clothes they were wearing and one or two items. Years of hard work went down the drain. They couldn t even access any of the savings in banks. A place they called home vanished within seconds. My dad s family moved back to India but things just weren t the same, especially for my uncle. He became mentally unstable and after only a few days he left. To this day, we don t know where he is and whether he s alive or not.  Although what happened in Germany is not the same as this, I couldn t help but think of my own father s experience. Imagine being forced out of your homes, businesses within seconds and being beaten. Imagine a nation targeting you and only you for what you are. It s just despicable and makes me not want to live on this planet anymore. What gives someone a right to treat you inferior to them?     26 book reviews: Oh my! This book makes me want to read every interview with the author that I can find. One article I read credits this book (and two others) with changing the public 's perception of comics and potentially starting the use of the term \"graphic novel.\" I have read only one other graphic novel (the beautiful and brilliant Ca not We Talk about Something More Pleasant? by Roz Chast) so I am tremendously under-qualified to review this. I am not sure what I expected when I picked this up but what I got was a deeply moving story of one man 's Holocaust experience that was masterfully written and drawn by his son. Deceptively simplistic, the drawings allow the reader to be in the story...to see life as it was and then the changing conditions, the confusion, the horror, the bunkers. As father and son meet and talk, the drawings seamlessly transition from present day into the past throughout the book, giving a sense that those memories were always near to and part of him. I found it amazing how a well-placed line or dash on the face of a mouse could convey age, joy, sorrow, defeat. The drawings were incredible. I am certain there are treasures to be found with each reading of this incredible tale.  More than a story of atrocity and survival, this story reveals much about the author 's relationship with his dad. An old-fashioned man whose entire history is heartbreaking and his son are divided by cultural and generational differences, estrangement, and misunderstanding of one another, yet they share the devastating loss of Anja and the need to understand her suicide. The author 's father, Vladek, is presented in a way that seems unquestionably authentic with character traits both endearing and frustrating. Vladek 's syntax and word choices make it so the reader can actually hear his accent, feel his escalating anger at times, understand the disconnect between father and son. What a touching tribute to his father that Art Spiegelman has created in this (presumably) honest portrayal. I cannot begin to imagine the atrocities the elder Spiegelman had endured, nor do I imagine it was easy to live with this man. I fell in love with page 133, on which Vladek tells Artie he will be famous like Walt Disney. There is so much conveyed in those few frames.  I was a junior in high school when this book was published. We were required to read Night by Elie Wiesel (which I re-read and reviewed recently) but up until now, I had not heard of Maus. This was recommended to me by our librarian. When I saw the cover I honestly thought she had lost her mind. I stand humbly corrected. I am running to get the next book, which is the conclusion. I cannot effectively put into words how ingenious this book is. 5 stars.  27 book reviews: I have a real, real problem with this book. It 's a powerful piece, and tells the story of one family 's experiences of the Holocaust in grim and gripping detail. it 's also an amazing exploration of the relationship between a father and son. I would love to give it 5 stars. And yet... I could not give a decent rating to a book that depicted black people, Muslims or gays as pigs, and I ca not give a good rating to a book that depicts Poles as pigs. The book is not the history of the Polish people during the occupation, fair enough, but Spiegleman draws on stereotypes and shows a great deal of ignorance of events in Poland, Belarus and Ukraine during the years of the Nazi occupation. He seems to prefer the Nazis to the Poles. The Nazis are evil but elegant, the Poles are just brute animals. Apparently, when Spieglaman was challenged about the way he depicts Poles in this book, he said 'Stop squealing.' I have not a source for this quote, and I hope it is wrong. Powerful? Yes. Racist? Yes.  28 book reviews: I can only plagiarize what Jules Feiffer wrote, included as an encomium on the cover of my copy:  A remarkable work, awesome in its conception and execution  at one and the same time a novel, a documentary, a memoir, and a comic book. Brilliant, just brilliant.  Truly. Profoundly chilling and incredibly moving. This tragedy of human history must never be forgotten, and works that mark it should be made across all creative disciplines. So appreciative that this book exists.  I highly recommend this work.  29 book reviews: So so sad. What a truly shameful part of our history the Holocaust was. To think that a group of people would be treated so abysmally for no good reason just hurts my heart.  Despite the fact that this was a graphic novel that had the characters portrayed as mice (Jews), pigs(Poles) and cats (Germans), it did not lessen the disgust I had against the Nazi system that condoned, encouraged and justified this mistreatment of Jewish people; Jews were given curfews, forced to wear armbands, forced to use ration coupons etc. I was truly sickened by it all.  This graphic novel is biographical; Spiegelman 's father recounted his personal experiences as a Polish Jew during WW2 to him. It 's difficult to imagine that there are many similarly horrific stories out there.  ",

The author also wrote about intercaste marriages.  Good book. Telling much knowledge about historical periods. Writing is smooth and engaging. Recommend to historical readers.  1 book reviews: This is kind of a historical fiction set during the later half of 1990s. Social prejudices are rampant. In this backdrop we follow Shekhar who is from a Bihari family near Bhagalpur. After staying for 11 years outside India in the west he returns at the age of 22. The story starts before his arrival when his mother and cousin Alka alongwith a couple of other women are busy making preparations for his arrival. During which Alka recounts a take of her childhood when she was molested by her uncle. After Shekhar telling his father about it, his uncle is asked to leave the house. The next day he is traveling but his car is stopped and he gets into this tiff with the district magistrate but he comes to know that the roads are closed because the Ayodhya verdict is gonna come out. Well the story unfolds step by step and is an amazing portrayal of how social prejudices like religious beliefs, social structure and hypocrisy and stubborn mindset affect everyone negatively and on an overall basis do nothing fruitful whatsoever.

So here it is, the title speaks about the Cold war in Berlin and the statue culture in Sanatan India on the birthland of Lord Ram.

The protagonists Alka and Shekhar strongly stood against the wrongs and fought against them.  The marriage between a Hindu and a Muslim, marriage between a Brahmin and a Dalit; these inter-religious and inter-caste marriages are not a problem, but a solution unto themselves. Even though it shall lead to complete destruction, yet a new society shall evolve, a new family will be formed and a  New Man  shall take birth in this new family.  The book consists of 35 chapters.it is quite common to lose its essence when translated but luckily in this book, that was not the case.  Writing is smooth and engaging. overal;, a decent book to read.   5 book reviews: I have read the Hindi version of this book and trust me I liked the Hindi version more than English. The reason is that, an original is an original you ca not get the same feeling reading a translation because unfortunately as much as we would like to believe there are some words in every language which ca not be translated.  When I was reading the Hindi version I could not understand the meaning of certain words but took help from my dadi to understand the story Better.  So in a way I was not only reading the book but was also interacting with my grandmother, an experience which was unique and special.  The plot is pretty intriguing, it talks about several stereotypes in the late 1980s which existed.. ( may be they still exist today). And the story is made interesting as it 's told from the protagonist 's point of view  Overall I liked the book n I give it a 4.5  .  The original got 5.  6 book reviews: This novel of Sanjay Choubey covering the communally sensitive period of India from 1986 to 1989. Notably, this novel is all about the sensitive issues of India. During the period of 86 to 89 various awful scenarios took place in India. It is based on the story of Shekhar and Alka and the problems they raised all through the novel. Issues like inter caste marriages, inter caste and inter religion relationships and much more are defined as solutions to awful situations rather problems. The 35 chapters shows us that why the title is suitable for the book as when we go the end we will find it.The theme storyline and the way of writing is extremely exicting and it bound me to read this book in a single day. Go read the book now!!  7 book reviews: The story revolves around the life of Shekhar, a 22-year-old individual who is back in India after completing his studies abroad. The story focuses on various social problems that often revolve our society, mainly during the period of 1986 to 1989, followed by an attempt to overcome the same. The story has been divided into 35 chapters. Although the book was originally published in Hindi, it has also been translated well into English, making it available for readers who find it difficult to read/understand Hindi. Having read the book in Hindi as well, I was intrigued to read its translation and I am glad to see that the story sounds equally interesting in both the editions. The narration style is fluid and comprehensible. Overall, a great intriguing read.  8 book reviews: I have always been fond of stories and novels in hindi, as I strongly believe that the essence, the impact, the aura that Hindi words can create, no other language can come close to that. I have already read the actual hindi version of this story, liked it and hence decided to go for English just to ascertain the premises I made above. And yes, I found myself proving correct.  The story does maintain most of its plot and the rigid social prejudices that our nation underwent in 1980s to 1990s but certainly the effect of horror has reduced considerably, in comparison to its original counterpart. One should ideally read the story in its original form, but still as an individual novella, its a treat to read and introduces one to the hardships faced by people in earlier years.  9 book reviews: It is an English translation of the book '9 November' by Sanjay Choubey . The book is about the issues faced by people during the communally sensitive period from 1989. Intercaste marriages, and the hardships that come from it is perfectly depicted. While reading this, I realized that we have come a long way since then, yet we have not fully adapted to the idea of inter caste marriages. It is a relief though, that we have made progress.  The topic being unique transported me to a different world altogether. Furthermore, the writing style got me instantly hooked and I loved getting my hands on a few more of the writer 's books and finishing them too (^.^)  10 book reviews: 9th November is a translated book of its Hindi version. The story revolves around the life of Shekhar, a 22-year-old boy who is back in India after done with his studies abroad. This is written for an ancient incident that occurred back then in the year 1986. This has dealt with various social and religious issues. Frankly. this book looks more prominent in its original language which is \"Hindi\" and it has lost a little charm after the translation is made.  But overall it is a great book written By Sanjay again. I am becoming a fan of his work and looking forward to reading more of his work  11 book reviews: The book is divided into 35 chapters. The story is all about the 3 years 1986-1989. The story is about lead characters Alka and Seema. The book shows us many things about the Indian history. Many issues are being very well plotted in the book like religion, caste system etc. The title of the book is perfect according to the content. After reading the book you will find out the reason behind the title and what happened in 9 th nov. Cover page is good. Storyline is amazing and worth reading for. Recommendations yes  12 book reviews: The plot of the story is about Shekhar, a 22 year old who is back in India from abroad after completing his studies. Story shows various social problems from 1986 to 1989. Also, the Berlin Wall fall on 9 November 1989 the foundation stone was laid on the Ram Janmabhoomi in Sanatan India.

Surely a good read.  14 book reviews: It 's the time of 9th Nov. 1989 when two major event took place....firstly in Berlin the wall was demolished and secondly the statue culture in Sanatan India on the birthland of Lord Ram.  It discusses about the social problems specially intercaste marriage and it 's consequences at that time period(1986-1989) is perfectly depicted. Here Shekhar is the protagonist,22 yrs old returned to India after completing his studies abroad.  The book consists of 35 chapters. Must read once to focus on the problems and participate in it 's solution.  15 book reviews: This book is a translated version of the Original Hindi story. The book removes around a 22 year old, Shekhar. The story follows the incident time of 1989, which was a very communal sensitive year. The word  inter-caste marriage  brings a lot of negativity, but it was much worse during those years. The whole stigma around caste and society is shown wonderfully. It shows how much development we need to have and how much time have really changed. Translation does leads to lost emotions in a book and the same has happened to this book. Overall, a great book.  16 book reviews: 9 November is written by Sanjay Choubey sir. Very good book. Everyone should read this book specially the young generation. Excellent story.

Final rating - 4 18 book reviews: The story is of time period of 1986 to 1989. During this time there lots of social problems faced by our people and biggest problem among them is inter cast marriage. This problem create large differences between them. lowers cast people were treated like slaves and they did not get any respect. These type of problems are shared in this book. And author trying grab our attention to these problems.

    " Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail": "book reviews: This is not a good book. Ray Dalio gets basic facts wrong, e.g. the timing of World War I; the impact of Treaty of Versailles reparations on Germany and Mitteleuropa; the definition of right-wing populism (it is not about making billionaires wealthier: it is populism);, which US president took us off the gold standard and when. He praises China for its weaknesses (totalitarianism) rather than its strengths. He contradicts himself repeatedly within the same chapter, sometimes even the same page.  So the general problem with is that Dalio gets historical events muddled up, things that are easily checked and widely accepted, then he uses that incorrect information to draw causal relationships about shifts in global political economy, e.g. US dollar losing its reserve currency status, and as Joe Biden said, \"China 's going to eat our lunch!\" I do not know about that! China has comparable income and wealth inequality as the USA. Also, Chinese and Indian citizens continue to send their children to American universities in droves, so our education system has not gotten THAT bad... yet. Oh, and Chinese flight capital lands primarily in big American and Canadian cities. Dalio does not mention any of this. Nor does he offer specific investment recommendation for Americans or westerners who want to survive/prosper if his predictions about China 's rise are borne out.  Dalio 's central focus, about long term money and debt cycles, has been analyzed and refined repeatedly over the past 100 years. I am referring to Kondratieff waves (circa 1926, capitalist economies are subject to spontaneous and recurrent depressions and recoveries every 50-60 years) and Kuznets business cycles (for which Kuznets won the Nobel prize in economics in 1971). Then there 's Peter Turchin; his field of cliodynamics is a bit pseudoscience-y but he is a bona fide mathematical economist. He tries to empirically determine how human societies evolve, and why we see extreme variations in economic performance and in effective or rather, ineffective government. Having read some of Turchin 's journal and specialist press articles, I do not think he does as good a job as Simon Kuznets. Oh, and there are also William Strauss and Neil Howe who wrote , about recurring social and economic cycles in American and world history. I have read work by the latter two (and studied Kuznets). Their works are factually correct about demography and history.  As other reviews mentioned, is repetitious. It has some of the most awful time-series graphs ever. I suspect that Dalio 's stature as founder and CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater is such that no one dares to edit him. He could have benefited greatly from an editor.  I am a financial economist. I am STEMy. I work at a bank. I fully realize that Dalio knows how to invest money and make extraordinary returns. That 's his forte! It rather fascinating how disconnected his abilities as an asset manager are from this book.  EDIT: I read the intro, Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 to the end. The book will be available on Kindle and in paperback in May 2021. It was published in hardback in November 2020. Dalio made it available early as a series of html web pages. That 's how I read it. Update 29 May 2022: Thank you to the person who commented about relative income inequality of the USA and China; I corrected that sentence above. Wrote review in Spring 2021, corrected typos in July 2023.  1 book reviews: \"Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.\" -- G. Michael Hopf, \"Those Who Remain\"  Dalio 's recent book is exactly about these four sentences. Or, to be more precise, about the rise and fall cycle of every powerhouse in history. Dalio approaches the topic carefully and dives deep - but focuses primarily on economics and politics (which are important, but there are other important aspects). The book 's 'grande finale' is the analysis of current empires: fading one (US) and the rising one (China). To show their similarities to the past empires (the Netherlands and Britain), Dalio provides blitz walkthroughs through their history.  IMHO this book is a-must-read. It 's hard to find an equally important topic these days and Dalio is very straightforward when it comes to his analysis (he does not pretend to be a diplomat). It 's not that he acts as an alarmist - he aims to be very pragmatic and remains cool-headed. He does not demonize China and does quite well in illustrating the cultural differences behind certain occurrences in their history. He also spends a lot of time on the concept of war (and the prospect for the next one coming).  Two points I find particularly interesting: 1. Dalio does not even try giving advice on how US could potentially \"extend\" its supremacy. This is not the goal of this book. 2. There 's a lot about monetary policies in this book, and the role they play in the \"cycle\". What I have missed badly is the impact of the new, decentralized currencies - not even the current situation, but what can happen in the forthcoming years - keeping in mind the liberal approach in Western economies and strict approach in China; IMHO that 's a very interesting topic to consider.  In the end. This is a helluva good book. Strongly recommended.  2 book reviews: Summary: This is what people think right now among those that have a lot of influence, so you should read it. While I largely agree with many parts, I do not hold the same framework and these are fundamental differences in how I see the world.  Having read his newsletters for more than a decade, I will never be anything but a huge fan of Dalio. He 's brilliant and anyone who believes otherwise has missed the point. The star removal is because we do not agree on a few fundamental things, and I know he 's smart AF, so it could only possibly be because he is refusing to see it that way.  My notes are for me, so I am more citing, b/c I sometimes have to repeat why I feel the way I do. This is not a review in the normal sense.  p.14 \"I believe the reason people typically miss the big moments of evolution coming at them inlife is that we each experience only tiny pieces of what is happening.\" \"From gaining this perspective, I have come to believe that there are only a limited number of personality types going down a limited number of paths that lead them to encounter a limited number of situations to produce only a limited number of stories that repeat over time.  .... something to think about in the context of his previous book and the idea that we can sometimes be academically lazy in reinforcing our own viewpoints.  p. 15 - He talks about how he came to this path of thought of this book. He was studying money and credit cycles and hoping to go backwards with his lens: \"... central bank actions push financial asset prices and the economy up, which widen the wealth gap and led to an era of populism and conflict.\"  p. 36 - He talks about ways to distribute wealth to advance society: ... \"... the formula for success has been a system in which educated people come up with innovations, receive funding through capital markets, andn own the means by which their innovations are turned into the production and allocation of resources allowing them to be rewarded by profit making. This happens best in capitalism and the government systems that work symbiotically with it. At the same time, how this is happening continues to evolve. For example, while ages ago agricultural land and agricultural production are worth the most and that evolved into machines and what they produce being worth the most, digital things that have no apparent physical existence (data and information process) are evolving to become worth the most.\" This is one of a couple of foundation stone in his thought process that implies the way he 's thinking about it is waves of preferences. I do not see it that way because this set-up embeds a particular thought process about causality and active action that I do not agree with. I would likely flip it backwards.  p. 44 He states the measure of power and wealth: \"1) education, 2) competitiveness 3) technology, 4) economic output, 5) share of world trade, 6) military strength, 7) financial center strength, and 8) reserve currency.  p. 63 \"However, unlike what most people intuitively think, there is not a fixed amount of money and credit in existence. Money and credit can easily be created by governments. Their creating it is liked because it gives people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments more spending power.\" He then talks about the idea that if you have too much debt the paying it back can be difficult. Here is where we are not quite on the same page. Because there is a period of time before money. While some might find that is irrelevant, the challenge with excluding it fails to incorporate the years prior to the dominance of money in politics. In other times, you might have just enslaved a bunch of people (or gone to war and brought back slaves). Alternatively, you can just have very rich people donate it (time, resources, money....etc) outright. That 's not money. That 's something else, i.e. making a bunch of people do something they do not want, inspiring people to do something you want them to do. That becomes important later to understand a particular unexplored area of cases and solutions in the book.  p. 70 \"For example, when the money and credit that central banks are creating no longer go into lending that fuels increases in economic demand and instead go into other currencies and inflation-hedge assets, it fails to stimulate economic activity and instead causes the value of the currency to decline and the value of inflation-hedge assets to rise. At such times high inflation can occur because the supply of money and credit has increased relative to the demand for it, which we call monetary inflation. That can happen at the same time there is weak demand.\".... Ca not tell if he 's implying that is the case right this minute. If yes, I respectfully disagree.  p. 71 \"In other words, using market values of what one owns to measure one 's wealth gives an illusion of changes in wealth that does not really exist. As far as how the economic machine works, the big thing is that money and credit is stimulative when it 's given out and depressing when it has to be paid back. That 's what normally makes money, credit, and economic growth so cyclical.\"  p. 76 \"Soon people treated these paper \"claims on money\" as if they were money themselves. After all, they were as good as money because they could be redeemed for tangible money. This type of currency system is called a linked currency system because the value of the currency is linked to the value of something, typically hard money such as gold.\" Ok... at this point it became clear to me that he is using the idea of money and currency in a way that is very different from the book \"1000 years of debt\" that clearly and cleanly demonstrates that even currency is a form of debt. here we are not on the same page, because i agree with that author. In thinking of money in this way he is thinking of money in terms of stored value that can be physically produced. In fact, that is not what money is or is moving toward. Money has always been a store of value and the idea of currency or debt has been surrounding how do store value for portability both geographically and temporarily in a manner that can be confirmed. This means that for a few chapters Dalio and I must agree to disagree, because he goes in the direction of the Gold Standard concepts and produces a history that, while true, is not the way I see it.  p. 78 - \"Money is what settles claims - i.e. one pays one 's bills and one is done. Debt is a promise to deliver money. In watching how the machine is working it is important to watch a) the amounts of both debt and money that exist relative to the amount of hard money (e.g. gold) in the bank and b) the amount of goods and services that exist, which can vary, remembering that debt cycles happen because most people love to expand their buying power (generally through debt) while central banks tend to want to expand the amount of money in existence because people are happier when they do that.\" IMO, no. this is merely a framework we have created. What settles a claim is the other person acknowledging the terms, of which money has become the predominant manner to do so. The amount of goods and service and your ability to provide this become the primary relevance, the amount relative to anything specific is irrelevant, as long as you debtor and debtee agree... this has to do with my definition in the previous section and leads to a very different conclusion. We both land on the same idea that the reserve currency is all good, but with different nuances.  p. 81 - \"When credit cycles reach their limit it is both the logical and classic response for central governments and their central banks to create a lot of debt and print money that will be spent on goods, services, and investment assets to keep the economy moving. That is what was done during the 2008 debt crisis, when interest rates could no longer be lowered because they had already hit 0%.\"  p. 85 - \"Some people think there needs to be an alternative reserve currency to go to, but that 's not true as the same dynamics of the breakdown of the monetary system and the running to other assets happened in cases in which there was no alternative currency to go to(e.g. in China and in the Roman Empire). The debasement of the currency leads it to devalue and have people run from it and debt denominated in it into something else.\" .... It almost ...and I really mean almost, that this is his pot shot at e-currencies/bitcoin.  p. 86 - \"By keeping an eye on the amount of debt that needs to be paid relative to the amount of hard money that there is to pay it, the amount of debt payments that have to be made relative to the amount of cash flow the debtors have to service the debt, and the interest rewards that one is getting for lending one 's money, one can assess the risk/reward of holding the time bonds.\" Yes... but .... and the but has to do with reserve currencies and also the idea that in such a case there is a desire to ignore in this any hard assets a country has that have nothing to do with assets. This is how China has taken over random mines and raw materials in a host of countries, so it 's not a kinda nuanced point. A bit of a pet peeve that people talk about balance sheet without incorporating all assets.  p. 96 - \"The US dollar now accounts for about 55% of the world 's international transactions, savings, and borrowing. The Eurozone 's euro accounts for about 25%. The Japanese yen accounts for less than 10%. The Chinese renminbi accounts for about 2%.  p. 104. \"There is a real economy and there is a financial economy which are intertwined but different. The real economy and the financial economy each has its own supply and demand dynamics.\"  p. 115 - Here he talks about why the US was the net beneficiary of WWI and WWII.  p. 120 - Here he talks about not holding bonds late in debt cycles. Interesting....  p. 157 - \"At its peak in the 19th century, the UK 's 2.5% of the world 's population produced 20% of the world 's income and the UK controlled over 40% of global exports. This economic strength grew in tandem with a strong military which, along with the privately driven conquests of the British East India Company, drove the creation of a global empire upon which \"the sun never set.\" p. 158 - it took 20 years after WWII for the US to gain dominance over the British pound. He attributes that to post-war debt. I would say yes and.... the US rise is more important on a relative basis and also what they had already lost from the colonies situation and their ability to exploit cheap later via that route, which dominated the period of imperialism. I know... this book tries to stay away from the idea of slavery for good reason in this political environment, but let 's just call it what it is ok....  p. 179 - ok... top paragraph on the Soviets being a rival to the US post WWII.... even if we made them a rival country and did this whole cold war, it 's f-in stupid IMO. .. the idea that the Soviets were a comparable rival power at any point is just disrespectful AF to what the Russians suffered post WWII and how that carried through. Super not fair. The scary thing to me is that Dalio knows that so why he 's putting it this way is awkward.  p. 182 - this 10 years of economic warfare before we actually take guns out... scary stuff.  p. 206 - talks about the importance of gold and reserve currencies in cross border transactions. I am gonna say yes... and yet again, but he 's not willing to go all the way to where I mentioned atop, i.e. that the point is not money, it 's the ability to agree on value portability both temporary and geographically. As such, we then have to listen to all this on gold and ignore any conversation about electronic currencies such as bitcoin which have no sovereignty attached. I am going to call it a microaggression.  p. 207... This is why I love Dalio. He 's willing to admit that Post WWII the US was super rich and as such it paid off a bunch of countries to do certain things.... those countries benefited .... btw... they are all the countries surrounding the borders of Russian and specifically China.  p. 215 -... Ok Look, I get why he 's blaming moving from the gold standard. There are so many tellings of this across the board. But seriously.... this love of Volker... really? I mean, let 's be really honest.... oil prices and food prices, does not matter what you do on a monetary side, it would not have changed things given what was happening with the Middle East Nations and how they felt about it. That would take decades of oil policy that we are currently undoing and it sure as hell would not have undone mother nature making crops not grow and our own stupid AF policies related to the way we paid farmers not to farm... and I KNOW Dalio knows this. so why is this being presented as such??????????  p. 218 - I had no idea that he had an early bad series of calls. Wow. vulnerable. #Respect.  p. 221 - he indicates the rise of EM due to the swap out of middle income American jobs to overseas outsourcing. He indicates he knows this is a massive simplification. I will allow it.  p. 225 - He puts the rise of income gap to the idea of a Money Financed Capitalist boom. The logic of this is that printing money and buying back stock largely made the wealthy wealthier at the expense of the poor.... I always hate these because another way to look at it is globally and you will see a very different picture, i.e. the US poor are just middle class in a global scale and the rich are coming up to the global scale. But then you have to incorporate the really poor countries to properly see it over the history of humanity. Still....  This leads to his point that domestically in the US you end up with social and economic inequality that leads to the rise of Trump. Maybe... or ... something else.... I think the something else is even more nuanced than what he 's saying here. So I do not love this logical short cut.  p. 237 - He shows how large China 's reserves are (in reserve currencies and other...) he then says ... \"... the US is very powerful because it can print the world 's money and would be very vulnerable if it lost its reserve currency status.\" This is true.  p.. 238 - \"... if the US dollar were to lose its reserve status and significantly depreciate in value it would have a devastating effect on the finances of those countries holding those reserves as well as private-sector holders of dollar-debt assets. Who would be the winners? Those with dollar-debt liabilities and those with non-dollar assets would be the big winners.\" True... but his path drawing might be abrupt, and the scenarios you would have to have if someone were to pay me cash money to assess how would you dislodge the US as the reserve currencies  it won t just be China rising further.  p. 255 - His depiction of China is so spot on... strategic with a far longer history to pull from for that strategy.  p. 259-260 He talks about the idea that there are few wars outside of China but many internally. YESSSSS!!! I have said this over and over again. China is not a European country.... why they would go to war is WAY the heck more limited. Their history tells you this. It s not their deal to be the aggressor. They are FAAARRR more likely to use other means.  p. 266 - This idea that the Chinese like to save more. I am not a believer. The public at large does not have as many options on the investment side. If there is no lending market at a reasonable rate with a legal system that easily supports it then yeah  people save. p. 269 - He intro 's the Century of Humiliation and the stakes that Taiwan has. Ok... so like this concept is from the last 20 years as a rallying cry for China to centralize together internally against an outside group.  p. 277-279 - He 's got a telling of China that is very quick, but largely, it 's fine. I do worry how laymen will read it who know nothing of the nuance of how he 's saying it.  p. 280... ths is a very fast history of China.. wow... hope people learn more ... while accurate it 's a bit glib. But I get it. Dalio 's got a lot of ground to cover.  p. 286... The long term goal of Reuniting China is a bit odd to say this way. I mean HK and Macao had specific lease terms during imperialism. If we had not done a bunch of stupid shit including the having Taiwan semi be lodged on that island, then possibly the island of Formosa could be \"worked out.\" at this point, I am not convinced the politicians know how to do this correctly..... I mean you have to dial back the microscope for a better understanding of Chinese territorial history.....but the whole world keeps leaning in to these highly biased nasty pictures of things  particularly recently....  p. 328 - \"China will probably advance its technologies and the quality of its decision making that is enabled by them faster than the US will. Big data + Big AI + big computing = superior decision making.\" Way to skirt the implications of why, which Dalio obviously knows..... and obviously it 's not because they are investing more....  p. 332-334 - This idea of the strengthening of China 's military... I wish he would just show the borders and what territory they are trying to control and it would make it less inciting and mysterious as to why they have to do that.  p. 342 - I like how he walks through each of the current reserve currencies and why even at 2% we should care a lot about the state of the RMB.  p. 357 the Enemy is Us is an intriguing one....It 's a long list... some of which includes defunding the military. I mean, you could also retool it if it 's that controversial.  also... I totally heart this: \"The internal wars and challenges in both China and the US are more improtant and bigger than external wars and challenges.\"  3 book reviews: To his credit, hedge fund guru and author Ray Dalio studies the past, to better understand the future. He observes that empires, like people and companies, have life cycles that include distinct phases. Fair enough.  Dalio s analysis of previous fallen empires, such as the Dutch and British, suggests that America is about to cede its global dominance to Communist China, which has caught up to the USA on some measures. Here, he is less convincing.  Granted, North American and European media are full of gleeful stories documenting America s decline and China s ascent, stressing Chinese rapid economic growth, massive population, work ethic and educational success. Clearly, the current Western tendency to obsess over our so-called  Social Justice  issues related to the horrors of Liberal democracies  colonial, slave owning, racist, sexist past is undermining self-confidence in liberal democracies around the world.  China s dictators must be laughing at our endless self-flagellation, which boosts their case for the alleged superiority of China s corrupt, brutal Communism among na ve, Woke Westerners, who haven t read any history nor economics. We ve forgotten how good we have it compared to our own past, let alone versus the grim present in the world s many autocracies.  While Ray Dalio may be a brilliant money manager, he is not a great writer. This book could have been about 75% shorter. Not only is it not concisely worded, but Dalio includes endless graphs with dubious, poorly marked axes. The frustrating lack of meaningful units on most of these graphs undermines his contentions.  The fact that this book appeared immediately before Dalio s Bridgewater Associates launched another private China investment fund suggests a financial conflict of interest that taints his conclusions. Dalio appears to be flattering the brittle, thuggish Communist Party of China leadership, while goosing his own fund s sales prospects.  This is known in the investing world as  Talking one s own book.  American private equity investor and politician Mitt Romney calls Dalio s breezy failure to acknowledge China s brutality a  moral lapse . Leaving morality aside, the book suffers from a selective analysis that undermines Dalio s arguments.  The author makes almost no mention of demographics, which in China are unfavourable thanks to China s multi decade,  One Child  policy.  He notes the enormous power vested in whatever country issues the world s reserve currency (currently the USA) and implies that China is about to usurp that enviable position. Investors abhor uncertainty and regulatory randomness. It is very hard to imagine world financial markets adopting as a reserve currency, the money of a corrupt, brutal dictatorship that uses currency controls, separate classes of money for foreigners and opaque, arbitrary rule changes.  Worse, Dalio s own criteria for national success, including the rule of law, lack of corruption, efficiency of resource allocation, openness, and low indebtedness, all underscore China s unsuitability for global leadership.  For someone who has generated so much wealth for himself and others by understanding numbers, Dalio is mesmerized by recency bias. He s rightly impressed by China s rapid growth from a low base, but seems to believe that his vague, cartoon graphs will just continue on their current trend.  China suffers weak demography, political oppression, a debt shell game, rampant corruption, inflated growth statistics, regulatory opacity, a non-independent kangaroo court system and a central planning process that created  ghost cities  full of empty apartment blocks. All these faults violate Dalio s own success criteria and appall investors, yet he pretends they pose no barrier to China s future, glorious rise.  Surely, they do undermine China s future and make his analysis appear flawed.  This is an interesting book, but it s neither well edited nor persuasive. It reads more like a long marketing brochure for Bridgewater and Dalio s new friends in China s Communist Party.  For a rebuttal of Dalio s thesis, read Peter Zeihan s books, which, while not perfect, are more logically consistent.  4 book reviews: Dalio is an archetypal hedgehog, Isaiah Berlin 's model of a writer and thinker who relates everything to one big central vision. In Dalio 's case, his vision is that human economic activity moves in cycles and patterns that transcend cultures, empires and even centuries. To this organizing principle, he brings research, data and repetition that yields a persuasiveness to his perspectives on where the world has been and where it s going regarding the economic conditions of many countries, past and present, and the well-being and developing situations in the US and China. The future is not written, but the patterns it goes through are predictable and ineluctable. We ca not know when things will happen or exactly how, but that they will, and that stepping back to look for tell-tale signs can show where in the cycle a country (or empire) is and what to expect next.  Part history, part macroeconomic financial literacy primer and DIY investment guide, part op-ed column, Dalio 's book is cogent and convincing. He sees a big picture through all the static and noise. No doubt experts in any field that he touches on could argue about details or his specific interpretations of them, but the classifications and categories of the data he combines into the stages of the cycle, and why, and the overall vision he creates from them, sort of feels like the Periodic Chart - did it always exist and a man \"discovered\" it, or was it invented? He made me think \"of course, this is how we should be looking at the elements of the economic welfare of nations.\"  A really good read that makes me feel educated on things we as humans, as part of an economic environment, should be aware of. After all, it affects us all in myriad, innumerable ways.  Note: His repetitiveness isn t a fault in my eyes, but evidence illustrating the recurring patterns and cycles he propounds, making manifest his vision, and his rhetoric persuasive.  4 and 1/2 stars.  5 book reviews: Despite I think this book is poorly edited (e.g. repetitions, unnecessary countless references to earlier/later chapters, many disclaimers, verbosity, structure of explaining topics: first in general and then again in more detail) and despite large chunks are not unique (filled with texts out of Ray Dalio 's book \"Big Debt Crises\" and random history books), I gave it a 5* rating.  Much of what most people, including myself, read each day is for collecting information. However, I think the greater purpose for reading is to gain understanding. This book does that by delivering me great new insights.  Mark Twain stated: \"History does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes\". That is exactly what Ray Dalio proves with this study. Out of the previous 500 years he distills the archetypical big cycle behind the rises and declines of empires. This increases my understanding enormously of the cause/effect relationships within this cycle.  The most relevant historical arcs seem about 100-plus years. Therefore some events happen only once every couple of generations. People on average have a few decades of life experience and are usually caught by surprise by major events. Now I understand that these events logically happen within a big cycle and that these have happened many times before in history.  In addition, the author shares valuable insights from his connections/friends, ranging from the common man to the elite in many parts of the world. Furthermore, Ray Dalio projects his findings on the present / near future with the big cycle decline of the United States / Dollar and the big cycle rise of China / Renminbi. He does this in a very openminded way for both the US and China.  After reading The Changing World Order, you see the world through a different lens.  6 book reviews: This book dispels the common narrative that \"China copies stuff from the west and is run by an inferior top-down governance system with the communist way of resource allocation\". Before reading the chapters in the book, even I used to feel that China is the evil side and USA is the superior side. But the studies about the historical events depicted in the book with a perspective of looking at the recurring patterns (The economic cycles, and the rise and fall of the reserve currency empires) provides enough evidence to think otherwise.  Though all the chapters are being structured to provide the necessary framework to evaluate the current state of affairs between China and USA, the principles discussed in the book timeless and general enough to apply to other economies too.  A book worth reading for sure!  7 book reviews: After a rather repetitive and simplistic start, I started to get convinced by the big picture view Dalio sketches. Thoroughly thought provoking To have peace and prosperity a society needs productivity that benefits most people. Do you think we have this today?  Far from a perfect book but I can t say I don t agree with the overall view on the broad trends of economical development. Like Yuval Hariri but on a different topic. More thoughts to follow    8 book reviews: \"The empire long divided must unite and long united must divide. Thus it has ever been, and He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass\"   Ray Dalio created a powerful model to understand and to predict the future of empires: to understand what was happening and deal with what would be coming you have too study past analogous periods : the rises and declines of empires, their reserve currencies, and their markets. In other words, to develop an understanding of what is happening now and might happen over the next few years.  Ray studied history, he saw that it typically transpires via relatively well defned life cycles, like those of organisms, that evolve as each generation transitions to the next and he created his theory of BIG CYCLES and DETERMINANTS   The rise is the prosperous period of building that comes after a new order. This period is characterized by excesses This is the painful period of fighting and restructuring that leads to great conflicts and great changes and the establishment of new internal and external orders      Just as we can see the arc of the human life cycle from birth to death and how one generation impacts the next, we can do the same with countries and empires. We can see how values, assets, liabilities, and experiences are handed down and how their evolutionary effects ripple out across the generations. We can tell when an empire is approaching its peak and when it is in decline  Ray share his description of the workings of that drives the rises and declines of empires and their reserve currencies   1) the cycle of good and bad finances . 2) the cycle of internal order and disorder. 3) the cycle of external order and disorder (due to the degrees of the competitiveness of existing powers in fighting for wealth and power).  (The three big cycles are 1 ,2 ,3)  4) the pace of innovation and technological development to solve problems and make improvements 5) acts of nature, most importantly droughts, foods and diseases  (The Big Five : 1 ,2,3,4,5)   1) education, 2) competitiveness, 3) innovation and technology, 4) economic output, 5) share of world trade, 6) military strength, 7) fionacial center strength, 8) reserve currency status.  Each of these types of power rising and declining in cycles comes together with the other cycles to make the one Big Cycle of the empire s rise and decline AND other determinants such as geology/geography,rule of law, and infrastructure that matter too.   What most people and their countries want most is wealth and power, and money and credit are the biggest influences on how wealth and power rise and decline. If you don t understand how money and credit work, you can t understand how the system works, and if you don t understand how the system works, you can t understand   Take a moment to think about your own fnancial situation. How much income do you have now relative to your expenses and how much will you have in the future? How much savings do you have and what are those savings invested in? Now play things out. if your income fell or disappeared, how long would your savings last? How much risk do you have in the value of your investments and savings? What are your other sources of money. These are the most important calculations you can make to ensure your economic well-being. Now look at others other people realizing that the same is true for them. See how we are interconnected and what changes in conditions might mean for you and others who might affect you. Since the economy is the sum of these entities operating in this way, it will help you understand what is happening and what is likely to happen.    The biggest thing affecting most people in most countries through time is how people struggle to make, take, and distribute wealth and power, though they also struggle over other things, most importantly ideology and religion.   Stage 1: when the new order begins and the new leadership consolidates power Stage 2: when the resource-allocation systems and government bureaucracies are built Stage 3: when there is peace and prosperity Stage 4: when there are great excesses in spending and debt and the widening of wealth and political gaps Stage 5: when there are very bad financial conditions Stage 6: when there are civil wars/revolutions  Nothing is forever other than evolution, and within evolution there are cycles that are like tides that come in and go out and that are hard to change or fight against. To handle these changes well it is essential to know which stage of the cycle one is in and to know timeless and universal principles for dealing with it.    International relations are driven much more by raw power dynamics. That is because all governance systems require effective and agreed-upon 1) laws and law-making abilities 2) law enforcement capabilities ( police) 3) ways of adjudicating (judges), 4) clear and specified consequences that both suit crimes and are enforced and those things either don t exist or are not as effective in guiding relations between countries as they are in guiding relations within them.    1- leadership that is strong enough and capable enough to provide the essential ingredients for success 2-strong education. 3-strong character, civility, and a strong work ethic 4-low corruption and high respect for rules, such as the rule of law. 5-People being able to work well together, united behind a common view of how they should be together 6-a good system for allocating resources, 7-being open to the best global thinking 8-greater competitiveness in global markets 9-strong income growth 10-increased investments to improve infrastructure, education, and research and development 11-rapidly increasing productivity 12-new technologies 13-a rising and significant share of world trade 14-a strong military 15-strong and widely used currency, equity, and credit markets. 16-at least one of the world s leading   For me this is one of the most powerful models, am thinking seriously to implement it in a context of IA project, 4.5    9 book reviews: Pros:  1. Interesting topic choice with lots of insightful analysis of historical and geopolitical events.  2. I really liked all the graphs and tables. Anyone with scientific/analytical edge will enjoy it.  3. The summary and author 's observations seem to be quite objective and accurate. His thinking process is convincing but conclusions will probably not keep many Americans pleased (most negative reviews here point out China glorification and US downplay).   Cons:  1. The author is certainly a good investor but ...... a terrible writer. Incredibly verbose and repetitive. He talks about what he will be talking about and what he talked about previously and the same thing over and over again. This book, if well edited, should be 75% shorter. The writing style was a killer for me.  2. I am not exactly sure who was a target audience here. Some fragments are very basic and are waste of time for any readers with even street level knowledge of economics. However, some parts are quite challenging and data analysis requires probably more advanced education and analytical skills.  3. Overall, the cyclical concept is not new and you will very likely know most (if not all) presented information. What 's interesting here, is the way it was analyzed and if we will accept obvious conclusions on the emotional level.   We may like it or not, but all Empires fall sooner or later and this book explains in a very convincing way how and why. The competitors may win by stealing intellectual property, morally questionable actions, cold pragmatism, humanitarian violations or any other way. But win is a win, regardless if we approve it or not. We can pretend it 's not happening or just look at the data.  The question is not if, but when.  10 book reviews: The \"I did my own research\" for economists.  I am most surprised that anyone read this beyond the prologue.  The author, a popular hedge fund manager, figures his investment success is largely due to his understanding of long-term intra and inter-national trends in debt and politics. He literally says he 's going to look back at historical events, figure the 'cause and effects' and apply them to present day trends. That 's when he convinced me to return the book for a refund.  IMO the great irony of this book is that the unchallenged hubris of billionaires is likely the cause of more political and economic strife than the \"causes\" he hopes to find in his historical research.  A sincere thank-you to Audible for allowing me to get a full refund for this.  11 book reviews: Purely from technical and historical perspectives, it s a great book, particularly I m not a finance person while his clear explanation of the cause/effect of various fiscal and monetary policies has enlightened me a lot.  However, his take on the US and China rivalry has tarnished my otherwise high regards for this book. Per Ray, all superpowers are going through ups and downs, like cycles and each of them would be overtaken by other newly emerged powers.  As a reader, what I got is his pitching for others to accept this unavoidable course of history. So just sit back and make sure to place the right bets on China because the US is doomed to fade out in history. Hence, do not take offence of Chinese practices. Just a few cases in point:  p.449-450:  The Chinese hierarchical culture makes it natural for the Chinese to simply accept the government s direction, while the American nonhierarchical culture makes it acceptable for Americans to fight with their government over what to do. Similarly, different cultural inclinations influenced how Americans and the Chinese reacted to being told that they had to wear masks in response to COVID-19, which led to second-order consequences because the Chinese followed the instructions and Americans often didn t, affecting the numbers of cases and deaths and the economic impact.  If he 's not so ignorant, he should recall that the Chinese doctor turned whistleblower, warning the highly infectious virus at the very beginning, was forced by the Chinese government to confess of spreading the fake news. Just imagine the number of cases and deaths and the economic impact could be reduced should the censorship be not so aggressive.  p.453:  That is the cultural inclination / style of Chinese leadership. They can also be wonderful friends who will provide support when needed. For example, when the governor of Connecticut was desperate to get personal protective equipment in the first big wave of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths  I turned to my Chinese friends for help and they provided what was needed, which was a lot.  I couldn t believe what I read! Hasn t he heard about Chinese mask / PPE diplomacy? He s right into this, being used as a propaganda tool and yet he thought this is something to be boasted of?  p.436:  from my discussions it is my belief that China has a strong desire not to have a hot war with the US or to forcibly control other countries (as distinct from having the desire to be all it can be and to influence countries within its region).  To me, it may be true that China doesn t want to declare wars against other nations but if other nations dare not to respect for Chinese people s sentiments, China will retaliate by economic sanctions. Is this what Ray can praise for China s stance of not making wars with others?  p.426:  Now we need to drop down and look at where we are in more detail, hopefully without losing sight of that big picture. As we drop down, things that seem imperceptibly small in retrospect   Huawei, Hong Kong sanctions, closing consulates, moving battleships, unprecedented monetary policies, political fights, social conflicts, and many others   will at the time appear much larger .   Having said, this book might be interpreted in a more constructive way, by using it as a wake-up call to all Americans, to fight for their freedoms and values.  12 book reviews: https://www.principles.com/the-changi...

For example, in the Roaring  20s you d want to own stocks and avoid bonds, while in the depressionary 1930s it would be the opposite; in the inflationary 1970s you d want to own hard assets like gold and avoid bonds, while in the disinflationary 1980s you d want to own financial assets and avoid hard assets.  One should consider minimizing one s ownership of cash and bonds in dollars, euros, and yen (and/or borrow in these) and putting funds into a highly diversified portfolio of assets, including stocks and inflation-hedge assets, especially in countries with healthy finances and well-educated and civil populations that have internal order. These things are especially important in this paradigm. In brief, I think one s assets and liabilities should be well-balanced with minimum exposures to dollar, euro, and yen currency and debt assets. During this time, I also think it will pay to be short cash (i.e., borrow cash [on fixed rates]).

Thought #1 - Everything is cyclical - History has taught us that nothing is forever other than evolution, and within evolution there are cycles that are like tides that come in and go out and that are hard to change or fight against.  After the creation of a new set of rules establishes the new world order, there is typically a peaceful and prosperous period. As people get used to this they increasingly bet on the prosperity continuing, and they increasingly borrow money to do that, which eventually leads to a bubble. As the prosperity increases the wealth gap grows. Eventually the debt bubble bursts, which leads to the printing of money and credit and increased internal conflict, which leads to some sort of wealth redistribution revolution that can be peaceful or violent. Out of these debt, economic, domestic, and world-order breakdowns that take the forms of revolutions and wars come new winners and losers. Then the winners get together to create the new domestic and world orders.  Thought #2 - Chinese are more strategic and long term thinkers. Chinese empire is on a rise now. - As a result of their longer history , the Chinese are much more interested in evolving well over much longer time frames than Americans, who are much more interested in making quick hits i.e., the Chinese are more strategic than Americans, who are more tactical. The arc that Chinese leaders pay the most attention to is well over a hundred years long (because that s how long good dynasties last) and they understand that the typical arc of development has different multidecade phases in it, and they plan for them.  Thought #3 - US empire has passed its zenith in 60-70s and started inevitable decline(everything is cyclical)  Thought #4 - US and China relationship are complicated ones as the world order is rapidly changing.  14 book reviews: I have a ten-year-old granddaughter who for the past few years has had something that ranges from an infatuation to an obsession with dinosaurs. At the height of her passion she would fill 16 tournament brackets with various species of dinosaur and conduct thought experiments about who would win a fight to the death for each pairing. She would then work her way through the tournament algorithm until a champion dinosaur species was crowned.  Aside from what this says about the OCD genes rampant in my lineage, I was reminded of her activities by this book in which Ray Dalio does something similar, replacing dinosaurs with countries. Although Dalio does not contemplate fights to the death, his impressive system of rankings of countries, using 18 determinants based more or less on statistics about each country, could easily be used for such a purpose. While I might quibble with the author on the weight given each determinant or exactly how it should be quantified, the effort that went into his ranking system is certainly praiseworthy.  As might be expected from an author whose day job is as a hedge fund manager, economic criteria appear to have pride of place in his rankings. The economic advances made by China in the last 40 years have not gone unnoticed by Dalio, neither has the inability of the US to tax itself for the government services it provides and the resulting indebtedness. The author sees history as cyclical in that countries become powerful, then decadent, then fall by the wayside, to be replaced by another at the top of the heap. In this regard, he regards the US as on the down side of the cycle and China on the upside. Indeed a cynic might consider the author 's entire effort as an elaborate rationale for explaining why his clients' pension funds have been invested in a tool and die works in Sichuan.  Regardless of his motivation, for those who have wondered where world history is headed, the author is not shy about letting you know what he thinks and why.  15 book reviews: The Changing World Order is a sober, almost surgical, distillation of some of the grand macroeconomic principles that have driven historical empires to their heights and through their collapse. Ray 's monstrous research project covers two key topics: 1) a 30,000 ft view on the factors and cycles that led recorded history 's leading empires to take the global mantle and subsequently lose it, and 2) a close-up view on current US-China relations, where, he argues, will be the location of next baton pass in global leadership.  Admittedly, Ray takes a crack at quantifying all human history - a hilariously impossible task. It is far from perfect, but it has dramatically changed the lens by which I try to sift through the chaff of current events. It will take me loads of rereads to fully internalize the depth and complexity he walks though, but I highly recommend it. He is unabashedly bearish on where the US resides on its arc as a global power (Spoiler: Hanging on by a thread), which will ruffle lots of feathers but may also need to be reflected on more widely.  Given Dalio 's unique perspective as a hedge fund titan with global interests and his personal history with China 's great unleashing of economic capabilities, I especially admire the empathy he gives to each perspective in today 's global tango. He refrains from taking an \"Us versus China\" footing, but rather takes an almost detached view for each empire (as only an investor can) to help build context and understanding as to why certain flashpoints today (eg. Taiwan conflict) matter so greatly.   In the markets and in life, to be successful one should bet on the upside that comes from a) evolution that leads to productivity improvements, but not so aggressively that b) cycles and bumps along the way knock you out of the game.   16 book reviews: The entire first half of the book is a highly oversimplified history crash course \"  l'am ricaine\". Which might have been just fine, should not there be so many factual errors and logical fallacies. If you are American or a really poorly educated European, I guess you may find something new or exciting.   Unlike European countries, the US has fewer natural barriers, such as mountains and seas, that might have decided it into separate nations; therefore, it is a united homogeneous country.  *laughs in Native American*  His considerations regarding future escalation of the US-China relations are somewhat interesting and I did in fact find quite a few perspectives I have never considered earlier. Still, it became hard to estimate how valid they could be given wild inaccuracies in the first several chapters. Ray Dalio is undoubtfully a titan in IB/PE, but his expertise in other matters turned out to be rather awkward.  17 book reviews: Every now and then I encounter a book that is colossal in most senses. This is one of them. It takes a broad view of the past 500 years to discern patterns of change in the world order. These patterns are then collated to derive an over-arching theory of change. Just when you get the hang of that, the overall big cycle is then broken down into it 's constituent parts and the individual drivers of change are then analysed. Like I said, it 's a big work.  The author then goes on to spend the bulk of the book to sift through the evidence and to make his case. I found the arguments to be quite compelling. They are certainly well researched and well made. The cycle is distilled into a narrative, where one thing is shown to lead to another, as part of a natural progression. Every rise is shown to contain the seeds of its own destruction, so decline and fall are part of a natural process. Over the past 500 years, this cycle is applied to the Dutch, British, American, and Chinese empires.  That 's where the story becomes interesting. In looking at the transition between the American and the Chinese world, the story becomes contemporary and then moves into the future. This has my attention. The author suggests that future events will follow a familiar trajectory. He may well be right. However, whilst he can point to the direction of the flow, the timing of future events remains a matter of conjecture. For example, he says that the US Dollar will lose it 's pre-eminence. I agree, but this is not entirely helpful. When will that happen? And by what mechanism will that happen? These are gaps in the thinking that need to be filled in.  In that respect, the book is a great first step. The author admits this. The model needs further refinement to provide some indications for a timeline. This is a gap that I am keen to cover. That defines how I see the book. It is one of those books to which we shall return from time to time. There is something really big in here and unlocking it ought not to be too much of a problem.  The size of the book - 500+ pages - is an impediment. It is not written particularly well, but there are a good number of charts to break up the reading process. Going through it is hard work, but I found it to be very rewarding. I would imagine that I shall return to the basic model fairly soon, in an attempt to blend it with other long term models of change, such as Peter Turchin 's. I quite like this hybrid approach, and I think that will be my next step.  18 book reviews: IMO this is a  amust read' book in the current, but also in a future situations. It is a book building also on concepts Ray Dalio described in his \"Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises\" book from financial point of view.  In this book Ray Dalio goes through the analysis of a cycle or power 's rise and fall and factors contributing to it. He is sharing his approach to looking at those factors and how those cycles plays out from the financial and political point of view.  Through this lens he guides us through the rise and fall of powers in last centuries - Netherlands, UK and currently unfolding US - China situation.  This book is dense. There is not a lot of \"foam\" or examples, but there is a lot of data and charts to back his points of view. On this, some people might feel unease that you do not know how those are plotted but Ray Dalio makes it clear, that it is something he build for himself and company. He also shares his scoring in the book and what factors are evaluated.  It is not a guiding book. It gives you a model of the world built by Ray Dalio and what might be the consequences + possible time frame of changes. It stresses out that change might be turbulent and that you need to prepare for it, but it is not a doomsday scenario.  It also discusses potential dynamics on the US - China transition as a worlds power and what might be the consequences.  One metric which shows that it was an interesting read (subjective) is that in total I have made 122 notes/highlights through the book.  Recommended additional reads are \"Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises\" from the same author and \"The Dragons and the Snakes: How the Rest Learned to Fight the West\".  If you want to get the main points there is also and article with summary of the book on Ray Dalio 's Linkedin profile.  19 book reviews:            ,      .                .            .        ,          .                .                        . 20 book reviews: God I hated this book. I have immense respect for Ray Dalio, the founder of the world 's biggest hedge fund. His goal with this book, to turn his immense resources and connections towards mapping the world order and its challenges is noble. It 's just a tremendously bad book.  The fundamental problem is laid out on the book 's first page, where he name-drops a bunch of famous people he talked to to develop his world view. The list seems superficially diverse, but most of, and the most impressive of, his sources boil down into two categories that seem very different, but were united in serving him the same faulty vision of the world. The first is highly placed Asian thinkers and politicians, who are deeply invested in proselytizing about the coming Asian century. The second is hyper-glorified US weapons salesman like Henry Kissinger, and H.R. McMaster. You might think these weapons salesman might be selling US power as hard as the Asians are selling China, but it 's in fact the complete opposite. They are just as invested in rising Chinese power, though pitched as a threat rather than a happy story.  This book says it 's all about data. I do not doubt that many of these figures are useful, and it was good of Dalio to centralize them and publish them, in this book and on his website. But when you drill down on the individual metrics, it 's clear that almost every non-financial piece of data, and a lot of the financial stuff as well, is deeply squishy. They are based on numerous assumptions and choices about how things are going, and what the overall trajectory is. This is normal, and is the case with every model of the world. But because Dalio 's top level assumptions are so uni-directional, assuming China 's rise, and the US 's fall, the whole product is deeply suspect.  But not as suspect as his glosses on history. These go beyond the questionable to the fraudulent. He claims to have studied multiple historical powers, but it seems likely that he only studied the British Empire. This is a good empire to study. In fact it 's the only real model for the United States, as it 's the only entity that put together a true world-wide system before the United States did. But what Dalio does is use the British Empire, a sample size of one, to develop a model of the rise and fall of a great power and then claim it 's universal.  Dalio asserts that his models are \"timeless and universal\" over and over again. But it does not even apply to the other main historical model in the book, like at all. I have only read two door-stop books on the Dutch empire, but on the basis of that alone, I can tell you that his treatment of the Dutch Empire is completely erroneous.  I got so angry about the uses of history in this book that I made an angry video about it, which you can watch here:  Dalio is an important figure with a lot of resources. He mentions that his analysis of world order is meant to be iterative. I really hope so, because the project as it stands today is a failure. Hopefully the next effort will be better.  21 book reviews: Pretty crazy to be reading this as Russia invades Ukraine in what I can only imagine to be the last futile power grab of a disillusioned once-great empire.  This book is very popular in the crypto-verse and with investment influencers on Youtube. As I watch people line up outside of banks in both Russia and Ukraine to get their life savings out while they still might be worth something I can see why.  This is one of those singular idea books - the main thrust is delivered in the beginning and is supported by argument, statistics, indexes, etc.  What Ray Dalio wants to transmit to his readers is that throughout time one can see a cycle of Empire. This cycle can be broken down into six rough stages. By examining empires in this way, one can get a rough sense of where the current world powers are on the arc of this repeating cycle.  He does not have great news for those of us invested (emotionally above all else) in the future of the United States. But I do not think his reflections are inaccurate.  He also points towards China as the up-and-coming world power. I just hope the transition is peaceful and orderly. And that America will then have the chance to pull itself together again to become more competitive in the educational, technological, civil consciousness kinds of ways.  While I hope that some of Dalio 's predictions do not come to pass, for example : increased polarization in America, potential for greater political disturbance and civil war, increasing inflation and debasement of currency, etc. I can still take what Dalio says and try to 'hedge' my bets in my personal life, though real life bets are built in relationships, with time and with heart and it is not as easy to divide these things like a hedge fund manager might.  Dalio also gave me a new idea that I am surprised I have not run into before. That there are a myriad of different kinds of wars: trade/economic, technological, geopolitical, capital, military, cultural, and internal.  When you look for these kinds of conflicts in the world you can see much clearer the rivalry between nations.    22 book reviews: A really nice book. Very well structured and written. Superb resources included and very well referenced. I highly recommend it and have learned a lot from it, particularly the study of history and its application to the book thesis of the cycles. There were a couple of points that I disagreed with the author on. Namely, the notion that taxing the rich contributes to the decline of a nation. This seems like a dogmatic idea that the author slipped into his narrative in the book. The other notion the author claimed to also contribute to the decline of a nation is what he referred to condescendingly as the \"woke\" culture, as opposed to the meritocracy. Meritocracy is a necessarily at all times, and 100% agree with that. However, Strongly ingrained structural and systematic inequalities that sustain themselves over time require an intervention (even if temporary and time-bound) to correct those inequalities. The examples he draws from history are from nations that had slaves, and the so called \"meritocracies\" he referred to from then only applied to non-slaves. So his point is not very valid. Otherwise, the book was stellar. I have enjoyed reading it.  23 book reviews: A great review of history in the context of empires in a financial context.  As expected, Dalio presents a thorough analysis of previous empires rise and fall to destill a framework for understanding where in the cycle we are at any point in time. The concept is comparable to his book on Navigating Debt Cycles in format but with a particular focus in the current US-China relation as well as the route to the current situation through Dutch and British dominance.  The focus on underlying principles and consistent patterns makes for an intuitive and entertaining read which I believe to be relevant for finance professionals as well as people with an interest in the subject matter.  I would high recommend the book.  24 book reviews: To create more wealth, you have to be more productive.  Ray Dalio created an interesting model about how the world works and how empires rise and fall. I underline the word \"interesting.\" After reading the book, I am not convinced that the model is bulletproof. And to be fair, the author himself acknowledges that. For example, I am curious how analyzing the demographics of a country (some countries have pretty aging populations) would influence the model.  The writing itself is... subpar. The text is more verbose and repetitive than it needs to be.  I appreciate this new lens in how to view the world. It made me curious to read different takes on the same broad topics. Other reviewers have recommended Peter Zeihan as someone whose analysis differs from Ray Dalio 's.  25 book reviews: Jei iskesit knygos pradzia, kur Ray kalba ta-pati-per-ta-pati, tai gausit gera istorijos ir ekonomikos skaitala 26 book reviews: For those who do not know of Ray Dalio: He is a  American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of the world 's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, since 1985, which he founded in 1975 in New York.  For someone who does not like or read a lot of help books I have enjoyed Principles and have also read Debt Crisis. This is the third book that Mr. Dalio has published and this book takes us through the history and more precisely economic & political history of the rise and fall of various empires.  Dalio s analysis of previous fallen empires, such as the Dutch and British, suggests that America is at the end of a big cycle and will cede its global dominance to China, which has caught up to the USA on some measures. To Dalio 's credit - he reads and analyzes history that goes beyond an economic cycle and rather analyzes a more holistic view of how different forces interact with each other in a long-term cycle. This book provides a smorgasbord of information on various factors that led to the rise and fall of Dutch empire, who were the inventors of Capitalism as we know now and then how the British arrived to fill in the gaps left by the failing Dutch empire. Similarly, how America filled the void of a superpower post WWII. He also discusses various determinants that form the basis for the rise and fall of any empire.  Dalio then delves deep into China and walks us through the fascinating history of various dynasties such as Tang dynasty, Song dynasty to the current regime. He then discusses that China s rich history has shaped her leaders ideology, whereas Americans views are limited due to much shorter history.  Chinese philosophy revolves around three broad concepts:  1) Confucianism, which seeks to bring harmony by ensuring that people know their roles in hierarchy; 2) Legalism, which favors unification by autocratic ruler; 3) Taoism, which teaches that it is paramount importance to live in harmony with the laws of nature  Interestingly, the traditional chinese military philosophy teaches that the ideal way to win a war is not by fighting but by quietly developing one 's power to the point that simply displaying it to capitulate an opponent (Highly recommend reading Art of War)  While the past of  western democracies is nothing to tout about, Dalio was oddly quiet on human rights issues (Uighurs), riots in Hong Kong and Covid-19. Dalio 's predilections towards a pro-China reached its crescendo when he ended up thanking the Chinese authorities for providing him l masks during the peak of the pandemic but failed to discuss Bridgewater 's investments in China.  However, we would be delusional if we ignore China 's rise, as no other country other has uplifted more people out of poverty in the last three decades. In addition, one cannot ignore the political polarization America is going through which may create more internal disorder in the coming years. As Abraham Lincoln said  A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" The conflict with China is more plausible as the ideologies of the two countries couldn t be more different.  One interesting tidbit I learned on a footnote on page 487: There have been just 50 wars between great powers since 1500, per Steven Pinker s Better Angels of our Nature. Eighty percent of the years before 1800 had wars; its been 20 percent since.  In the appendices, Dalio discusses various determinants that are responsible for a country 's outlook i.e., education, innovation & technology, debt burden etc., but I would have liked another variable % of young population to the mix. Countries such as Japan have an aging population with minimal immigration; which may further exacerbate the slow growth.  I highly recommend this book if you are interested in economic and political history and ca not wait to read Principles of Investing when it comes out.  May the force of evolution be with you!  Thanks to my wife for gifting me this book for Christmas.  27 book reviews: The main messages are: 1) Countries, especially empires, go through cycles. US is declining in this cycle, and China is inclining. 2) This cycle can be judged by various factors: education, innovation, debt, trade, etc. The author summarized these factors and compared them between past empires Dutch and UK, and now US and China to support his arguments.  I found this book from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TISMi... (an interesting interview). I notice that in the comment section there were many people trashing him simply because it seems that he did not say what normal American media would say about China. Hence I was interested in reading this book to see what exactly what is so controversial. Basically he does not think that CCPs are evil but just do what they think is the best for China. He touched upon some sensitive topics and gave a less popular view to them (the Tiananmen Square protests, constitution change to abolishing term limit).  While I see some arguments and alternative opinions may be important to know, the book is not well executed. The phrases/sentences are repeated, arguments circulated, and there exist too many justifications like \"I do not know for sure but I know the best people in the field and they agree with me.\" I did not enjoy reading the long book.  28 book reviews: Dalio has said that he was never a good student and after reading this I can see why. The performance of his hedge fund shows that he s clearly a smart man but being a good student usually requires one to be a good writer and well   Besides being poorly written I also found the book shallow in it s analysis. Dalio claims to have identified 18 or so  determinants  that allow him to predict a nations futures prospects. However most of these ideas are obvious (ie an inventive population improves a nation s prosperity) and there s no sophisticated discussion of the relative importance or interaction of these factors.  The section on debt, inflation and reserve currency is interesting but it is short and Dalio has written a whole other (free) book on that topic so skip this and read that instead.  29 book reviews: Incredible book. You will never see geopolitics in the same way anymore.  It 's my first book by Ray Dalio and now I want to read them all. (I can see the author is too proud but does not remove from the quality of his writing.)  If you want a systematized way of analyzing countries behaviors, internally and internationally, this is the book.  I am a fan of Acemoglu & Robinson \"Why Nations Fail?\" of which the thesis is basically \"democracy succeed\". This is totally ignored by Dalio. I would be interested in seeing an analysis reconciling the two points.  This is the first book where I see the Dutch story in the 17th century so emphasized.  ",
    " Rand McNally 2022 Large Scale Road Atlas": "book reviews: A must read for every adult to understand why you are who you are. 1 book reviews: This is the classic atlas for planning an American road trip. And it does the job nicely. Well indexed and annotated. However, I am slightly disappointed at the quality of the paper used for the map pages - clearly a thinner and more vulnerable grade of paper compared to past editions. When plotting and taking a road trip, the pages sustain quite a lot of handling, wear and tear. And the pages of the current edition are not really very robust. ",
    " Red-Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win": "book reviews: This book will have a different meaning for people living in the Caribbean than the US. The Chinese have been offering aid, education and business to all the places, about 70 countries, in the Caribbean and Africa that the US and West in general ignore as part of their Belt and Road Initiative. You can read about it here, wikipediaDOTorg/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative.  How it works in the Caribbean is like this, using Dominica as an example. They shore up a very corrupt government by bribing all the influential members of the ruling party. These people, now rich beyond their wildest expectations, refuse to allow supervised elections and make life very difficult for people who are outspoken against the government. They also pass money on down so that companies give their full support to the government and fire people who are known voters of the opposition. My friend said that you had to have two t-shirts at election time. One for public wear that supports the government, and one for the other side when you go to their parties.  The Chinese make loans for business which when not repaid, they ruthlessly take land in exchange. A lot of land. They give education aid by scholarships in China, in a Chinese language, for such useless things as Tourism. My friend was offered one, how was she to learn about tourism in Dominica in China and how was she to learn university level Chinese? They are laughing at the people.  The police are taken to China for special training (!). Institutions are given loans, hospitals are built. But nothing comes without strings and the strings are made of steel and it 's like a web in the Caribbean, hospitals in St Kitts, Grenada, Antigua & Barbuda, a huge seaport in Jamaica, $500M investments in Barbados, similarly in Suriname, Venezuela, Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo) and Cuba too. Jamaica has at least five institutes teaching Mandarin, Barbados is teaching it too.  This is from a government newsite and not at all independent. dominicanewsonlineDOTcom/news/homepage/homepage-carousel/china-is-proud-of-being-able-to-help-dominicas-social-and-economic-development/  This is from an American site gatestoneinstituteDOTorg/16813/china-military-caribbean.  So I am not reading the book from the same perspective as Americans, although I know it is entirely about the American elite and their corruption by the Chinese leading to Chinese having outspoken friends in the political sphere, easing their path into eventually, what they hope, will be the same sort of political take over as on the Caribbean islands. Politicians looking independent but all those of influence will be in China 's pay.  1 book reviews: This is such a distressing book, one that many the American should probably read. It covers a very unsettling concept, that we are literally be sold out to China, which really means the Chinese Communist Party. Peter Schweitzer, has written for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, National Review, Foreign Affairs. He knows of what he writes of including a plethora of emails, documents, and through investigation into the category we know as the elites.  The Bidens, the Bushes, The Pelosis, former Senators and current members of the Senate, Feinstein, McConnell and others) and members of Congress, former Secretaries of State (Henry Kissinger, Madeline Albright to name a few), former Congressional leaders (John Boehner) are deeply entrenched in \"business' in China. What Mr. Schweitzer points out to the reader is that all Businesses in China are connected to the CCP. These 'ties\" go back a long way and are particularly disturbing considering our current leaders are deep into this play for pay, prestige, and power. These seem to be the great aphrodisiacs for these families. He does mention Hunter Biden and his famous laptop which of course provides so much of what we now know is true. Even included in the number of sell outs is the Trudeau family so the US is not the only one finding itself in the quagmire of self-serving leaders.  Not to be left out is the titans of Wall Street, and the social media kingpins, like Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Jack Dorsey et al. One tech giant, the Alibaba company, led by Jack Mar. works closely with a US company on developing such programs such as facial recognition something quite useful to China as a way to identify the Uyghurs a group they wish to do away with. It 's a troubling concept that the first person the head of China, (CCP) Xi Jinping, went first to see Mark Zuckerberg while in the States instead of the president. All of these intertwining companies share information on its citizens, have opened up the illegal stealing of our intellectual properties, making China grow into a position where it will eventually surpass the US. Scary stuff indeed!  To leave out Wall Street would also be a mistake. Many of the titans of Wall Street also take rose-colored glasses look at China. If we are making money, then the harsh realities of a dictatorship can be pushed aside.  Peter Schweitzer names names and shows connections that can be proven and not denied. He and his team spent over a year of dig deep investigative reporting to bring his findings to us. It 's a look also at how so many have gone soft on the Chinese atrocities. They give benevolent comments that seem like a slap on the wrist while countless numbers have been killed, imprisoned, and disappeared. One recent example of this was Nancy Pelosi 's urging our athletes at the Olympic Games to say nothing harmful because this is their culture. (a claim made to excuse their atrocities)   If this information in the book is untrue, Mr Schweitzer would be sued by the grievants but they of course want this to be buried along with possibly millions of people killed by the CCP. The mention of Tienanmen Square (where the CCP killed thousands) also elicits the same response of this is the way we needed to go forward to control the \"dissidents\", for to be a dissent in China means a likely end of life. (It 's their culture and we have our own racial problems in the US is another standard response)  I realize many of us scoff at this book possible saying the coined phrase of Russian interference, or disinformation. Think, if this book details disinformation why is it not challenged? Perhaps, and this is the scary part, it is all true. This is not a book that takes sides, it is one that presents information and lets we, the reader take it from there.  It was certainly a huge wake up call to this reader. I will be the first to acknowledge that we are in deep trouble and need to be alerted to what we hear, what we watch, and how we adapt ourselves in a world of lies and deceit.  One other addendum was the fact that guest speakers, political pundits, and experts on policy, on TV should have their connections to China made know to the public watching. In that way, we, the public, would know where their allegiances lie.  Bottom line is China is not our friend. Their goal is to emerge as number one in all fields and to that end they will step all over the US, aided by our own citizens,(the elites) to achieve that goal.  2 book reviews: Elites in Silicon Valley, Congress, Wall Street, and Higher Education have basically old out the United States to China. This book has solidified by hatred for Big Tech and for the Chinese regime. Honestly, I think the chapter on Silicon Valley is the most damning. Read this if you can handle high blood pressure. 3 book reviews: This was both the perfect and worst time to read this. It 's well written and researched. These people are truly despicable. 4 book reviews: Every source is named and nobody is safe from the investigations conducted by Peter Schweizer and a crew of forensic investigators.  Peter is president of the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute (GAI) and a senior contributor to Breitbart News. They spent over a year investigating for this book that many of the political elite as well, as their families, will be less than happy about its publication. Schweizer took away all the excuses by carefully untangling events where ever they lead.  First up in the book is the Biden Family and how deep the entanglements with China reach. Involvement begins when Joe was a congressman, magnifies while VP with Hunter, his brother and others joining in and the subterfuge becomes more pronounced. Laptop issues are discussed as are the President s  claims of knowledge .  After the chapter on the Biden Family, Schweizer moves on to Senator Feinstein and her husband, Speaker Pelosi and her Family, Mitch McConnell and his wife, just to mention a few of the elites! Each of these power couples will be none to happy about seeing themselves in print in this book.  Big Tech and Wall Street have been in the news along with their very wealthy owners and their lobbying with various committees in DC. Reading about it here is clearly organized and doesn t have the inflammatory emotional rhetoric involved with mainstream infauxtainment folks.  Schweizer goes back and looks at how/when the US relationship with China started down this path to trouble and we have Reagan, Albright, Kissinger, Clinton, the Bush Family, Obama and Trump. It s really sobering to look at the changes in business & technology over this timeline and to compare the US growth with China s. He believes that many agree with a Kissinger idea that at some point in the not too distant future, Beijing won t have need of the US and when that happens,  they will be difficult to handle.  Basically, they have paid to play; the elite have their fortunes tied to China and the rest of us are learning now just how much our daily lives are tied to them. We ve been caught  Red Handed   5 book reviews: This is an excellent compendium of investigative journalism by Schweizer. He spares no one--not Republicans, Democrats, basketball stars, capitalists, bankers, nor universities as he delivers painful details about how Chinese have bought off so many of them.  While discouraging, this is a very important reference about what lies behind public, promotional statements in the US about China that have become so common, and that so cloud the issues: lots of Chinese cash, influence, and power.  Thriller readers and anyone who wants to really understand what 's going on in the US-China relationship should read Red-Handed.  Highly recommended.  6 book reviews: Reading this book may just make your head explode with outrage. Be careful.    It should be obvious to everyone that the Chinese government is a repressive, authoritarian regime, without question. They have gotten very good at making top officials in other countries look the other way with money, favors, and gifts. This book calls out some of the elites, mostly Americans, who have chosen worldly gains over universal values. Schweizer excuses no one, regardless of political views or affiliation.  Chapter 1: The Rope   introduction Chapter 2: The Bidens   A followup to Joe Biden s dealings exposed in Secret Empires. The corruption here is staggering. Chapter 3: Capitol Hill   How senators and congressmen get rich from China, compromising national security, particularly Dianne Feinstein, Eric Swalwell, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, John Podesta, and others. Chapter 4: Silicon Valley   How tech CEOs have sold out to China and helped China become a state-of-the-art surveillance state. The big offenders are Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, Eric Schmidt and plenty of others. Chapter 5: Wall Street   How American elites fund shady Chinese activities, especially Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone; Goldman Sachs; Bridgewater hedge fund; and of course Larry Fink and BlackRock. Chapter 6: Diplomats   How diplomats become lobbyists for China once their assignments are over. This includes Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, William Cohen, Concoleezza Rice, Robert Gates, and Max Baucus. Chapter 7: The Bush and Trudeau Dynasties   The Bush family s connections to China, particularly Neil and Jeb. We also take a detour into Canada to investigate Pierre and Justin Trudeau. I don t get how Canadians elected someone so corrupt, but then again, Americans picked Joe Biden, who s arguably even more corrupt. Chapter 8: Higher Education   How universities act as fronts for Chinese money and give easy access to spies. (Remember, China doesn t innovate. It steals intellectual property instead.) These universities, especially Yale, illegally accept lots of money from Chinese donors. Harvard and other colleges are also guilty. Chapter 9: Fighting Back   Suggestions for laws and citizen activities to curb Chinese activity that harms national security and aids China s human rights abuses. The final hundred pages of the book consist of notes and sources.  Clean content  ===================================  New evidence makes clear that the Biden family received some $31 million from Chinese businessmen with very close ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence during and after Joe Biden s tenure as vice president. Indeed, as of this writing, some of those financial relationships remain intact.  The hazard of a Chinese businessman with close ties to the top ranks of Beijing s spy agency conducting financial transactions with the son of the U.S. vice president cannot be overstated. How this did not set off national security or ethics alarm bells in Washington is a wonder in itself.  Vice President Joe Biden continued to emphasize in his discussions that China was not a rival or a threat to the United States and that a rising China was good for America.  Hunter Biden was now the U.S. representative for an intelligence- and military-linked Chinese company that was supporting voices calling for an aggressive military posture against the United States and its allies.  Each deal the Bidens secured in China was via a businessman with deep ties at the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. And in each case there appears to be little discernible business or professional service that was rendered in return for the money. With their cultivation of a close financial relationship of influence in American politics. Being financially bonded to the First Family provides enormous opportunities for leverage.  Lenovo, with Senator Feinstein s husband a major owner, would a few years later be accused by U.S. officials of placing spyware on computers sold to the United States military.  Concerns about climate change have become a powerful tool for Beijing to divert attention from human rights and other issues. In September 2021, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi delivered a speech at Cambridge University in which she acknowledged China s  genocide  of the Uighurs, while proclaiming that partnering with China on climate change was the  overriding issue.  John Kerry, the former U.S. senator and secretary of state, has said the same. This gives Beijing enormous leverage by granting it a powerful tool with which to silence their critics: talk too harshly about genocide, and we will no longer cooperate with you on climate change policies.  Under the Paris Climate Accords, Beijing, which is the world s largest carbon producer, can continue to grow its carbon emissions up until 2030. ... The accords also assume that China will honor its commitments and offer no penalties if they fail to do so. ... China was a big winner in another way, too. The United States will honor its commitments under the Paris Climate Accords largely by buying solar panels and other green technologies manufactured in China.  [Bill] Gates has cooperated with the regime in ways that other tech titans have not. He has lent credence to the claims of the Chinese Communist Party and been rewarded with access, favors, and titles. He has done the bidding of the regime in the tech world and has apologized or made excuses for its aberrant activities. On top of all that, he has invested in companies attached to Beijing s military-industrial complex. Gates appears to have always underestimated the repressive nature of the CCP. His relentless techno-optimism has made him an easy mark. He has expressed naive attitudes about the role of technology in that repression.  Collaboration between American tech companies and Chinese military-linked research labs has enormous implications for our national security. What makes that collaboration even more galling is the fact that China has very different anticipated uses for the technologies than the United States. ...  Authoritarian regimes will continue to use AI-powered face recognition, biometrics, predictive analytics, and data fusion as instruments of surveillance, influence, and political control.   When legislation was introduced in Congress that would require determination whether Chinese entities might be leveraging U.S. companies that do work with NASA, SpaceX lobbied against the legislation. Some national security experts are very concerned about Beijing s ability to leverage Musk and possibly SpaceX.  So, BlackRock takes extra care to speak to providers of weapons to law-abiding American citizens. In China, they own shares in companies directly linked to the People s Liberation Army. The companies in which BlackRock owns shares directly support Xi s  Military-Civil Fusion.  One wonders who might suffer at the wrong end of those weapons and technologies. There is no evidence that BlackRock has spoken to these Chinese companies asking them how they are  responding to society s expectations of them.   Wall Street thoroughly bought into the idea that as China grew more prosperous, it would become less militaristic and more democratic. Of course, that has not happened. And money is fungible making China more prosperous helps them build their military. That means that even if financial deals with the Beijing regime may not be directly related to military activity, they still pose a serious security risk.  Indeed, Wall Street has been a go-to weapon for Beijing to deploy against Washington. As Clive Hamilton and Mareike Ohlberg write in their book ...,  Whenever presidents Clinton, Bush or Obama threatened to take a tougher stance on China s trade protectionism, currency manipulation or technology theft, Wall Street chiefs used their influence to persuade them to back off.   America s diplomats are hired and paid to look out for our national interests. They take an oath to do exactly so. But how effective can they be at their jobs if they are looking down the road and seeing fat fees by doing business deals in China? The revolving door is a permanent fixture in Washington, D.C. Usually, it spins between the U.S. government and American businesses. Diplomats have globalized it and far too often gone into business with our chief rival on the global stage. Beijing knows this, and through seduction and perhaps even cajoling, manages to put many of America s national security and diplomatic figures on the payroll.  Sometimes, Beijing finds influential Westerners who are true believers. They believe they are being given lucrative opportunities in industries they know about because China is the new land of opportunity. They believe the Chinese system is creating unparalleled economic justice. They believe China will eventually become a force for good in the world. When China finds people like that, they shower their families with economic and political rewards.  Pierre Trudeau and his family have justified their silence on matters of human rights because they do not want to  judge Chinese values by western standards.  This is a naive and absurd position. It also happens to be a favorite line of argument pushed by the CCP. The suppression of rights and the brutality of the regime in China is not a function of a Leninist dictatorship run by the Chinese Communist Party. The brutality that occurs in China is similar to that of every Marxist-Leninist regime: the Soviet Union, East Germany, and Cuba, to name a few.  When the Canadian government joined the United States and the European Union in sanctioning Chinese officials involved in the suppression of the Uighurs, some [Chinese officials] turned angrily on Trudeau. ... But Trudeau was hardly leading the parade. He gave all indications of being a reluctant participant. Just two months earlier, on February 22, 2021, the Canadian House of Commons voted 266-0 in support of a resolution calling China s actions against the Uighurs  genocide.  Trudeau and his cabinet abstained from the vote.  A few months after [Joe] Tsai became a full-fledged NBA owner, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey set of a firestorm with a simple tweet about ongoing protests in Hong Kong.  Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong,  he tweeted. The Chinese government in Beijing was furious and immediately asked for Morey to be fired.  [Daryl] Morey s tweet was not the first time the normally outspoken [LeBron] James has remained silent about Chinese abusive actions. In 2007, black Sudanese Christians were being slaughtered in Darfur by a regime backed by the Chinese government. In all, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 were killed. Beijing provided the regime with political support and was the Sudanese government s chief trading partner. The unfolding atrocities gave rise to a movement calling on Beijing to stop supporting Sudan. A letter to the Chinese government was written by one of James s teammates on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Every player on the team signed the letter, save two. One, a backup guard, had a shoe contract with a Chinese company. The other was superstar LeBron James. After howls or protest, James eventually did come out with a muted statement about human rights.  Ban joint research by American universities, investors, and corporations with Chinese military and intelligence projects. It is shocking to discover that we actually have to pass a law preventing American tech firms and universities from working with and aiding Chinese companies that are part of Beijing s military-industrial complex. That is precisely what we must do. Why exactly does anyone in a corporate office or a college campus believe it is a good idea to help strengthen Beijing s military capabilities?  Clyde Prestowitz: If the New York Times cannot be distributed in China, the CCP should not be allowed to own newspapers in America. If Amazon is limited in China s market, Alibaba should be similarly limited in the U.S. market. If GE will have to move its avionics division into a joint venture with state owned Avic, Washington will halt the move unless Avic drops state ownership and enters into joint development, production, and sales ventures with Boeing and Airbus for its planned new aircraft. Just as U.S. universities, nonprofits, and religious organizations are restricted in China, so Confucius Institutes and Chinese Student and Scholars Associations will be restricted or banned in the United States.  7 book reviews: Quite the interesting book, to say the least. Almost a political form of the Godfather series! However it spans other presidents and their families, not just Biden. Funny how politicians are able to go into public service and come out millionaires, and yet, those working-class stiffs out in the society in which we live do what our state, or federal, representatives do...they go to jail for insider trading. This book, along with Gordon Chang 's the Coming Collapse of China, and The Laptop from Hell by Miranda Devine paint a very sordid tail in our political system...especially that of this present administration. Excellent book to read! Each book stands on its own merits.  8 book reviews: A thoroughly researched book into how China has co-opted politicians, institutions, and corporations.  I wish I could say I was surprised, or even disappointed. 9 book reviews: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/20...   https://www.breitbart.com/politics/20...   https://www.breitbart.com/economy/202...    10 book reviews: There is no one in Washington D.C. working for me and they seem to all be making a lot of money. Nothing suspicious here, move along, move along!  Books like this one do not start revolutions, but failing to thoroughly investigate and expose the corruption shown in these types of books does cause revolutions.  I knew Dianne Feinstein was a China supporter, I knew that her husband was up to his butt in Chinese deals. I knew that her chauffer was a Chinese agent. What I did not know is that her chauffer was not a chauffer but her office director? Since she chaired the senate intelligence committee, that might be a big problem.  Nancy Pelosi is a crook? Say it is not so!  I knew Mitch McConnell was an establishment hack, but I did not know just how tight his wife 's father 's connections with the Chinese Communist Party are...  I knew John Boehner is a drunk, I did not know about the firm he leads that supports China and the CCP.  I knew the Bush family was establishment scum, but I did not know just how tight Neil Bush is with the CCP. This book pretty much guarantees no Bush ever becomes president again.  I was not surprised about the Silicon Valley weasels selling their souls for a few more Chinese bucks. Each one of them is more craven and evil than the one before.  In short, this book will enrage anyone who actually believes in duty, honor, country.  The author gives a few ideas at the end of the book on fighting back, but they are not all that good. They seem weak and put in as an afterthought.  Since China is rapidly approaching a financial crisis, the payoffs may cease. When that happens, a lot of China supporters may change their allegiances. Only time will tell. I will note that the tech moguls are the more endangered. Their products are easily copied and the Chinese government may shortly have no use for them... I would hate to see them lose money...  I am thinking that if the United States ends up in a real war with China, a lot of these problems solve themselves. After reading this book, I have to go with the lets destroy China whatever that damned cost approach! It would be so simple to start such a war. Whoever replaces Biden, after the 2024 election, will need to finally deal with China. India and Australia seem raring to go...  11 book reviews: An eye-opening litany of everyone in America who is getting rich by dealing with China and it 's a long bi-partisan list. The last chapter which is very short is titled \"Fighting Back\" and provides little advice. Very depressing. 12 book reviews: This read is an excellent argument for term limits . It explains how the elite families and the well connected deal with China landing lucrative business opportunities all while professing to be against Chinas humanity violations. I believe it borders on treasonous and illegal acts that are ignored because of the elite players! The end always justifies the means  it s a very sad description of the undermining of our country and giving China a prominent place in the world. 13 book reviews: Dense and authoritative. Did I mention it s dense. I no know one who s challenged the veracity of the work and the work paints a grim picture of Chinese control over various American levers of power.  The question is how did china s communism succeed where Russia s failed. Russia had NATO arrayed against it, and by the 70s the US was using China as a counterweight. In a similar way in how Japan escaped after WW2 punishment bc of Russian fears so to did China.  Then there s China s market. Russia did not have 1 billion people to sell to and as China gave up its actual communism, Russia was fading, and tech driven globalism was catching on making that Chinese market more accessible and more financially lucrative.  I don t believe China s influence will be stopped externally. China will falter when its docile population decides to rise up   that is probably a generational time span.  14 book reviews: Most depressing book this year so far. Fiction or non-fiction.  Major, major research/ footnotes/ sources- reality.  We are absolutely paying for and giving China the rope to hang our entire structure, government, country upon. And it 's nearly everyone in power and all the elite technical and media friends. They are prospering.  Stark reality for the last couple of decades. In some cases, even more.  Relating how an American diplomat to such a major and populated country can actually dessert one side for another? That 's the lightest tale of thousands. And I do remember a time in my life when that would have been treason measured, just in the beginning processes of switching alone.  I concur with the poster who has the graphic of wanting to hit your head on the wall after reading this book.  15 book reviews: This book is so heavily footnoted and sourced, there is no way someone can, legitimately, disagree with it. Schweizer hits both parties hard with their actions and conflicts of interest. I try to pay attention to politicians who engage in this behavior since the 80s, but I was still surprised at some of the names that came up.  If you have any interest in how our lobbying laws are ignored, or twisted to benefit China, you need to read this book.  FIND IT1 BUY IT! READ IT!  16 book reviews: Just wondering who it was that praised Xi Jinping, for his  hard work  and  transparency  on the coronavirus outbreak, hailing a supposedly  momentous  phase-one trade deal, and declaring the U.S.-Chinese relationship to be  the best it s been in a long, long time.  Whose supporters/ family members were running seminars in China, immediately after the 2016 election, on how to gain US residency and move money? Who had ongoing business relations with China?  Who was it that said Putin is a great leader and a genius, while also saying that he believes Putin over the US intelligence community?  Who said that he has a great relationship with the Saudis because they spend a lot of money in his hotels and buys R/E from him, then sold advanced military equipment to them after they brutally killed and mutilated a US resident? And, spoiler alert, wasn t it his son in law who just received a $2 billion dollar investment from those same Saudis?  Yes, it was Trump, family and members of his administration. But the only reference to him and his administration in this book are positive. And there are many, MANY more controversial statements and actions that one only needs to google.  Those that take advantage of the system, both democrats and republicans, should be shunned or, in many instances, jailed. But it s disingenuous to ignore what Trump and his administration has done, and instead sing his praises  17 book reviews: Peter Schweizer has been doing excellent work investigating and reporting on US government corruption for many years. In this book, he broadens his attentions to also include Wall Street, Silicon Valley, academia, and Canada. The focus in this book is China s very successful decades-long strategy of  elite capture  as a means of overtaking the US. Some of the corrupt people China captured include the Bidens, Feinsteins, Pelosis, McConnells, Podestas, Boehners, Clintons, Bushes and Trudeaus. Some of the corrupt businesses and institutions they captured include Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Tesla, Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, Bridgewater, BlackRock and Yale. They also bagged a large roster of US diplomats and lobbyists, including Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, John Brennan, James Comey, Alexander Haig, Sandy Berger, William Cohen, James Mattis, Carla Hills, Brent Scowcroft, Mickey Kantor, Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates, Max Baucus, Terry Branstad and current UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.  These are distressing revelations that will raise your blood pressure. I had to put it aside for a few days at one point. Even if you had a general idea that this kind of stuff was going on, it is quite another thing to see it spelled out in so much detail. The book is very well documented, with 82 pages of endnotes. This makes the main text a very readable 250 pages.  There is a bit of relief from the grim parade of corruption and treason in the final chapter. Schweizer outlines some practical measures that would improve the situation if they were implemented. He also credits some examples of people who have not succumbed to China s elite capture strategy. Like them or not (and no one will like all of them), these include Democrats Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Chris Coons and Joe Manchin and Republicans Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Schweizer has always been non-partisan and even-handed in his investigations of corruption. The honor roll also includes tech executives Keith Krach (DocuSign) and Peter Thiel. It does not include any examples from academia or Wall Street, perhaps because the corruption there is so pervasive.  18 book reviews: Peter Schweizer has done it again with a expose of a Government run by elites who become rich from their ties to the very people they were elected or appointed to protect us from. He then takes us to the entertainment and sports elites who have become wealthy beyond our dreams and who bow down to foreign leaders who wish to one day take over our country. One example is LeBron James who refuses to call out China for their treatment of ethnic groups as he is heralded as an idol in China. Schweizer brings us up to date on the Biden Crime Family and how they have become wealthy from their ties to China and Ukraine. However, he presents a fair and balanced book by including members of both parties who have benefited from their previous and current positions. He includes the Bush family, the Trudeau family, the Pelosi 's, Kissinger, Gates, McConnell 's, Clinton 's, etc, who are all recipients of great wealth thanks to China and other foreign powers and Schweizer spells out how it is done. He also digs into big tech, Ivy League universities, and Wall Street. Kissinger once stated, \"When the Chinese do not need us, they are going to be very difficult to deal with.\" We are getting very close to the time when China will have reaped all they can from America; their goal is 2049. Please read this book to see some suggestions from Schweizer on how to turn this around. I am hoping it 's not too late and that someone is listening.  19 book reviews: It s a very nasty web of greed comes to light. But of course it depends on what side of the fence you stand on. Peter does a great job of connecting the dots and yes both sides of the isle are at fault. In other words we are all effed. Jk but maybe. 20 book reviews: 21 book reviews: This was an outstanding and fascinating book.  Why This Book I picked up this book as it sounded interesting as I am doing some political readings about China and Russia lately.  A Warning This was a fairly right-leaning book truth be told, but I feel you can read beyond that and still find it interesting and gleam some ideas from it regardless.   The first 2/3 of the book was a lot of history, but the final 1/3 is the current/future, where I found the book the most interesting.   At the end of this book was a set of recommendations. I feel that these guidelines and ideas were extremely helpful and eye-opening. They mostly dealt around how to deal with a wide range of international relations and foreign policy decisions, and I found them very well laid out.   Schweizer is a good researcher and good journalist. I found this a very fascinating read. I thought his other book, was quite interesting, but not even half as good as this book.   It reminded me a lot of , a book I would recommend as a companion to this book.   If you do not mind some right leaning narratives, it was pretty interesting altogether.  4.8/5  22 book reviews: Holy smokes...  I had no idea some of the most prominent elites in this country have been corrupted by Chinese investments, a bipartisan list of politicians, sports and entertainment celebrities, tech gurus, universities, and entrepreneurs that will make you want to throw up. It 's sickening the depth of corruption they will sink to for the sake of money, to cooperate with a foreign country that puts our country at risk in far more ways than I ever imagined, and lifts China higher on the world ladder. And it 's sickening the lengths they will go to to cover it up. Bought and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party. It 's a gruesome read that affirms the argument for term limits for politicians and why we should not idolize anyone who places China over the United States.  This was not easy reading...both due to the content and the emotional response as I was reading.  Mr. Schweizer meticulously researched the part our elites play in the China/USA games, and it 's an eye-opener for sure. A part of me wishes I had not read it, the other congratulates me for doing so.  If you have any doubt as to China 's end goal; if you have any doubt whether politicians are held hostage by the CCP; if you have any doubt how some of these people get so stinking rich, look no further. It 's all here in black and white.  23 book reviews: Quite good, but does not live up to the hype  I enjoyed this book, and learned about details and people I wasn t aware of. But anyone who has followed alternative media over the last few years will not be astounded, or even surprised. However it is a well-researched and footnoted addition to the proof of corporate America s motivation to suck up to the CCP. 24 book reviews: I was interested in this book and wanted to learn more about how China is a threat. There 's no doubt this book is well-researched but I just could not stay with it. It 's a laundry list of Chinese names and dry facts strung together that can be overwhelming. Even for a non-fiction book there was not much of a narrative. I found myself flipping pages without intaking the content.  Putting aside the book for now. Maybe when China 's economy finally collapses this will serve as a good look-back reference to see what the author got right and which elites went down with the ship.  25 book reviews: An eye opening book that will both disgust and frighten you. It appears that many of our elected officials and politicians are compromised and beholden to the CCP. While many of the other politicians are complicit in this because they do not stand up to this corruption and call the traitors out. Go along to get along strategy in play. Money, money, money, it s how our country is bought and sold by politicians. We must open our eyes and get involved with vetting these corrupt politicians better.  26 book reviews: This was a steep learning curve. I am embarrassed to say I did not know any of this. Our national security is completely lost, gifted and sold to the Chinese.  This is the result of the John Lennon School of International Relations with no borders, globalism, no threats. Everyone gets along astride unicorns crossing rainbow bridges.... Until reality bites, like when the U.S. Reagan administration 's promise not to go \"one inch further east\" than Germany was abrogated, the U.S. placed missiles ON, not near like Russia in Cuba, the Russian border, and the Russian bear was poked too hard.  What 's transpiring? Feinstein, Pelosi, McConnell, Biden, Bush, Clinton, Trudeau, the diplomatic corps, higher education, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, etc. have received illegal, undisclosed, and massive campaign contributions, forge commercial ties that strengthen the Chinese economy, military, and oppressive surveillance state, disadvantage U.S. economically but benefit them personally, and ignore major human rights violations of dissidents and ethnic minorities (like the concentration camps for Muslim Uighurs), Falun Gong, Hong Kong, and others.  A striking double standard is present throughout. Businesspeople, politicos, higher ed, philanthropists, etc. hypocritically promote diversity, inclusion, race and equity at home, while turning a blind eye to Chinese horrors. Joe and Clara Tsai donated $10M to activist groups in the US \"to advance social justice and economic mobility for Blacks, Indigenous people and people of color, founded a nonprofit focused on reducing the prison population, while remaining silent on China, its torture, its incarceration without trial, because that is \"the system of governance\" (338).  President Xi: \"Science and technology is a national weapon. We should seize the commanding heights of technological competition and future development\" through \"civilian-military fusion.\" All those techies like Zuckerberg, Gates, Musk, the folks at Google, YouTube, Cisco, Twitter, etc. are enthusiastic collaborators. Bill Gates said that the effort to censor the Internet would fail, but China quite successfully controls the Internet. The NSA wrote that authoritarian regimes like China (and increasingly, the USA) use A.I face recognition, biometrics, predictive analytics, and data fusion as instruments of surveillance, influence and political control\" (145). Peter Thiel seems to be the lone voice sounding the alarm: \"A.I. is a military technology.\" But \"in the era of AI, if data is the new oil, then China is the new OPEC,\" China collects vast amounts of data not available in the USA. \"More data beats a better algorithm.\" And the workforce is cheaper, \"smart, hardworking\" while \"complacency and entitlement\" prevail in the U.S. (166).  Back to Peter Thiel at the Nixon Forum in 2021, who said,     The fawning comments of Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, the world 's largest hedgefund, regarding Wang Qishan, \"the second most powerful man in the CCP\" are jaw droppingly concerning: \"a personal hero....Every time I speak with Wang, I feel like I get closer to cracking the unifying code that unlocks the laws of the universe\" (203). Sounds like a sycophant or acolyte. He also wrote:     Breathtaking and revealing. Cue Tears for Fears and \"Everybody wants to rule the world.\"  What can be done is the subject of the ninth and final chapter: \"Ban lobbying on behalf of Chinese military and intelligence linked companies, ban Chinese military and intelligence linked companies from appearing on American stock exchanges, and ban joint research by American universities, investors and corporations with Chinese military and intelligence projects.\" \"Journalists need to openly ask questions about links to China and media companies need to insist on truth and transparency when it comes to their experts.\" \"Wall Street firms need to consistently apply ESG standards to Chinese companies.\" \"Use shareholder activism to hold corporate executives to account.\" Engagement has failed and must be replaced with reciprocity. U.S. newspapers cannot be distributed in China, so the CCP should not be allowed to own newspapers in the U.S. Same goes for Amazon/Alibaba, GE/Avic, etc., etc.  Besides Peter Thiel, who is on the right side of this? Well, Trump, Schumer, Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, and Joe Manchin. Former CEO of Docusign Keith Krach.  And the final word belongs to Upton Sinclair: \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding\" (362).  The book is a revelation. There is too much detail for my taste, but those names will matter and be more meaningful to others. Yikes. The U.S.A. has been gifted to China wrapped up with a bow.  27 book reviews: A political hack writes a hit piece, but misfires badly.  Schweizer s book is nonsense for several reasons. He gets facts wrong, he trades in innuendo rather than evidence and his partisan critique causes him to ignore Republican politicians who he likes.  First off, Schwiezer often just gets the facts wrong. He says that the PRC is carrying out a reeducation program in camps in Nanjing Province. This is just poor fact-checking. Nanjing is a city, not a province, and the reeducation camps he is referring to are in Xinjiang, not Nanjing, fifteen hundred miles away. This mistake is indicative of more than just a lazy attitude towards getting things right. It also suggests how little Schweizer knows about his subject. Anyone competent to write about China would not have made this mistake. But he frequently is sloppy with the truth. He says that the Tiananmen Square Massacre involved 10,000 civilian deaths, but almost no legitimate scholar thinks it was more than a couple thousand. He quotes another writer as saying that Zhongnanhai is generally  forbidden to outsiders  but this is either wrong or grossly misleading, as important outsiders are often invited into Zhongnanhai.  Second, this book is full of insinuation rather than hard facts. Schweizer implies that Biden did not take China to task because it was funneling money to him through the Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He does not provide proof of this, but rather notes that it might be happening, as funds to UPenn have been increasing in the period after the Biden Center opened. He states that Anthony Blinken was  reportedly  involved in turning down allowing Wang Lijun to defect to the US because Blinken did not want to upset China. There is little evidence that this was true, and the reason that the US did not accept his defection is because Wang was knee deep in a campaign of torture and killing that the US would have looked bad doing it.  Finally, this book is off base because it does not criticize the behavior of popular republicans. Schweizer does attack some Republicans, but they are ones who are out of the Maga mainstream. Trump 's family members have been closely involved in several major deals in China, but they are not mentioned. It is clear that Schweizer knows who butters his bread. He is only going to attack those who are enemies within his ideological framework.  28 book reviews: It 's unfortunate that Joe Biden appears prominently on the cover of this book, because Democrats might get the impression it 's a hit piece on him when Biden is just one of many prominent politicians and business leaders selling the rope. Democrats would appreciate the dirt on the Bush Family, Henry Kissinger, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell. By the end of the book you will have heard so much corruption that what the Biden family did wo not seem unusual. China has so corrupted our political and business class that rooting it out will be fought on all sides by both political parties and most corporations. And although Kissinger is a main culprit his warning that China is going to be awfully hard to deal with when they do not need us anymore is as true as anything said in the book.  How did we get here? The fallacy that freer economics creates freer government instead of vice versa. American leaders promised themselves that more market driven economics in China would force political liberty when all it has done is fueled China 's military and made them a bigger danger to the free world. Schweizer says that we need to practice reciprocity. Meet every Chinese limitation on us by limiting them in the same way. Good idea, but would it be enough at this point?  29 book reviews: What a book! So much true information but hard to keep all the different companies and their initials straight. Could only digest one chapter per day. Had to put the book down and walk away at times as well. Oh what a web the Chinese have woven here in the USA. Thoughts of many people and institutions are toast. I encourage everyone to read this book. ",
    " Reminders of Him: A Novel": "book name: Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! 0 book reviews: I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting \"This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!\" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book.  Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages:  * When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses.  * Try to own things that put money in your pocket.  * If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money.  There you go. That 's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics.  Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she has not been \"discovered\" yet. He tells her to take courses in marketing, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to market them.  I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I would feel for responding to a \"get rich quick\" spam mail.  1 book reviews: This book may do a good job of getting you excited about your financial future but the false information it teaches negates any benefits.  I believe this book does a disservice to the public. I suspect it was written to appeal to those who are failing in the world 's conventional definition of success. Did not go to college? Ca not hold down a stable job? Good for you! You have not fallen for that waste of time and stupid rat race like all those other suckers!  Saying that higher education is not worthwhile is misleading. I agree it is not essential (and possibly not even helpful in rare circumstances), but the high correlation in the general public between education and wealth cannot be ignored.  He also gives poor advice in finances and investing. For example, not adhering to diversification. Or getting out of a stable job (a.k.a. \"rat race\") where \"even if you win you are still a rat.\"  The author praises learning correct accounting but then proceeds to butcher even the most fundamentals. For example, his first rule is \"You must know the difference between an asset and a liability\" but then he proceeds to claim that your home is a liability, not an asset. Completely backwards. Any accountant will tell you so.  The book is full of exaggerated and sometimes completely false anecdotes -- for example, it appears the entire premise of the book is false -- there never was a rich dad and Robert was not wealthy until he embraced MLM and started selling get-rich books.  If you just want some motivation, please try another book such as \".\" If you want sound personal financial advice, please read \"The Only Investment Guide You will Ever Need.\"  See for an in-depth critique of Kiyosaki and charts showing the correlation between education and wealth.  2 book reviews: This book is not just about money. It 's about how we are taught to think; how we are programmed by schools, family, and friends to look at the rich as greedy no good bloodsuckers and opportunities as risks. It is an attempt to reprogram minds to look at why we do what we do.. why do we buy all these shoes, clothes, cars, jewelry.. have we earned it or are we just trying to maintain an image?  To me the most important thing it teaches is that being educated is the key.. educated in our motives, in money, in the world around us.. educated does not always mean a degree lessons can be learned anywhere at anytime..  The book is great for people like me who think in pictures and in theory. He explains his financial theories clearly and adds diagrams to explain how money flows into and out of our wallets. I have read other financial self-help books and they were too detailed, too \"do this...do that...\" For me that did not help or motivate me because, I do not do anything unless I want to do it. Other books never really gave me the why. They told me what I needed to correct.. but if I do not see anything wrong in what I am doing.. why should I take steps to correct it? This book broke down to me the whys. And now I am ready for action.  3 book reviews: This book has a picture of the author on the cover. I should ve considered myself warned. But here s the thing - I m 28 years old, married with no kids, spent the better part of the last 10 years at uni and I work full time. I have spent my entire life studiously avoiding economics, finance, accounting and all associated disciplines, instead always choosing the history/politics/social sciences path, and then studying law. As a result, I have a big gaping hole in my knowledge, and no idea about what to do with the money that I m currently saving. Also, I have this thing where I through phases of obsessively reading and learning about new things. A few months ago, it was fish and aquariums (I m not kidding). Now, it s learning about.. finance. I actually can t believe I m writing this, but .. I am.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book that both taught me some things, and made my blood boil. It borders on negligent in many areas, and is downright offensive in the guise of being  helpful . I absolutely agree with one of the premises, that many people are financially illiterate. I also agree that many people aren t able to teach their kids money stuff, because they don t know that much themselves. This book made me think about what I m doing with my money and gave me some insight into the kind of things I am now going to look into and research. But it also scared me. This book is a libertarian s wet dream that was written to be a bestseller. He won, I guess.  It s terribly written   it really is abysmal. This book bats you over the head with a few ideas (one of which is that The Poor should just stop being so poor!) through numerous  conversations  with his Rich Dad (who is supposedly the father of his friend). It s horrendous dialogue; it actually.. I just can t. It s horrible. It talks about his father (the Poor Dad) who is university educated and hard working, but supposedly foolishly believes that getting an education and then a secure job is a waste of time. Education   what a joke, right? What a waste of time and money, that could otherwise be spent on high risk ventures that will always make you millions. That can be further invested to make billions. Rich Dad, however, never finished high school, and owns numerous companies that employ The Poor (read: stupid idiots) who work for him, because they re The Poor. Rich Dad teaches us how The Rich do things, and why that s all we need to do to join their ranks.  The thing is, not everybody is afforded the same opportunities, and the point about high risk, is that risks are high. Sometimes it all comes crashing down. The world is not comprised of  the rich ,  the middle class  and  the poor  and even if you look at it that way, it is a dangerous (and derogatory) to consider that people are poor because they don t make their money work for them. Because they re  losers  (I shit you not) who are too scared to take a risk.  It is fervently anti-intellectual. It totally disregards that not everybody has the capacity or opportunity to  pay themselves first  before paying bills, or quit their job to make money work for them. Money doesn t just come to you if you try hard enough. Sometimes you need to actually pay your bills because there are real life consequences to failing to do so. Like, your utilities being disconnected. Your credit rating being destroyed.  In my view, and in reality, not everybody can be an employer. Employers need employees. There is actual intrinsic value to things other than being an employer, running a company, and making money. Things like, helping people, making things, research, writing, hell   even working. I find it scary, that people would pick this book up, be motivated by it (because if nothing else, it s motivating. Because everyone can be The Rich!) and be lulled into a false sense of entitlement, purpose and safety by its messages. I imagine that in person, Kiyosaki is a cult leader type person.  As I mentioned, I m not well versed in financial or economic things   but I can smell bullshit and see when inconvenient facts or complications are glossed over. This one is getting filed in the bin, and I m going to continue my learning elsewhere!  4 book reviews:       ..               ..                                                 ..       \"       !\"                       ..    ..                                 ..                    ..                  ..           ..                       ..                   ..    ..                                  ..     ..                  ..           ..             ..        ..                   ..           ..            ..             ..                                     ..     ..    ..!    ..             ..      ..               ..               ..                     ..            ..         ..       ..                       ..                           ...!      ..             ..      ..             \"       -       ..!\"      ..                       ..             ..      ..                     ..           ...     \"     \"       ...   ..    ..             ..             ..        ..                   ..                               ..      ..                       ..!    ..           ..         ..                             ..            ...         ..  5 book reviews: I read this book while in an Entrepreneur phase. On one hand, it is rather inspiring, in a John Madden sort of way. You see, John Madden (American football broadcaster) always makes everything sound easy, which may be how he coached the Raiders to the superbowl. He will say something like \"now what they need to do here is score a touchdown. I think that if they can do that, they will turn this game around\".  I still recall a memorable game where a quarterback 's contact fell out, and while he and the refs looked for it, Madden said \"now here 's a guy who when he wears glasses, he can see better\". When it 's explained in such a simple way, it really seems like the easiest thing in the world. Unfortunately, one must remember that the 6'5 defensive line is not just going to roll over and say 'uncle'.  Real estate is not any easier. There 's always some conflict around the corner to trip you up and send you back to square one (or often, square negative one). So, while this book gives you such excellent advice as \"learn from failure\", \"make profitable deals\", and \"work hard for yourself\", it does not actually give you a system or method to make money.  This seems a strange irony to me, as this book is clearly marketed to people who are not smart enough to realize that they should 'work hard and not give up' if they want to succeed, but who are smart enough to be able to figure all the rest of the logistics out by themselves.  Now, there are supplementary books that give a lot more in-depth information, but they still tend to fall into similar traps. It seems to me that you are either the self-motivated entrepreneur-type, or you are not, and that difference will show itself often and early in life. The self-made may use this book, but to continue projects they are already working on, not to start their  wouldream business' from scratch.  There is another option for the marketability of this book, but it is not one I like to think about: depressed people who feel their lives going nowhere trying to stave off depression by clinging to untenable dreams. For these types, self-help and new age books act like a surrogate (or additional) religion: bolstering their self-esteem and making them feel as if their dreams are truly within reach.  Then, years go by and the dream draws no nearer. They get depressed. So they whip out this book (or another one like it) and suddenly feel like their millionaire retirement is only 6 months away! This makes them feel self-satisfied and complacent, so they end up doing nothing until suddenly, months later, they realize they are no closer to their goal. I am not saying people should not have dreams, and I am definitely not saying not to follow them, and I know people get attached to their denial, but it 's not going to make your life any better.  More than anything, this book is a symptom of the cult of the real estate bubble, for whom property was never a bad investment: it would never go down and rates would always get more and more favorable. To say that their view was naively rosy would be kind.  One day, so the story goes, Joseph P. Kennedy was getting a shoe shine when the shine boy started talking about what stocks were good to invest in. This is what we call  amarket saturation'--when one area of business becomes popular, and suddenly, it seems like everyone is joining in. Kennedy got out before the crash of '29, and an intelligent investor, seeing how many books and reality shows there were about flipping houses, should have seen the real estate crash coming.  Unfortunately, the fiscal prophets of the self-help section were unable to predict the coming apocalypse--so it 's lucky for them that their money was tied up in book sales and speaking engagements rather than in the real estate deals they were pushing on others. I would like to think that these sales would drop off after the  amiracle of real estate' turned out to be another hollow investment bubble, but in these dire times, people are even more desperate to find the path to economic stability.  Now, I know that most people who (do not say 'peddle', do not say 'peddle') market these self-help (or new age) products are not usually scam artists. Most of them believe in what they do; they believe that they are helping people; and I hope sometimes they do.  However, there is a difference between being a doctor and telling someone they have cancer to help them move on, and lying that there is no cancer because it seems more 'kind' or 'uplifting'. The latter, is, of course, morally reprehensible (said the atheist).  Kiyosaki has built an empire off of this book, and made himself a pretty penny. He has also been investigated by some critics who have challenged his assertions about his wealth, real estate successes, and the very premise of the book. There is no evidence that his 'rich dad' ever actually existed, and Kiyosaki has said in interviews that the character is, at best, a combination of people. However, at other times he has stated that he definitely does exist. And that does not even go into his support of con artist Casey Serin.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe you will buy this book and it will turn your life around, maybe Kiyosaki is relating a true story of struggle and inspiration--but maybe not, maybe it will just be another $5 in his pocket and less room on your bookshelf for real economic and legal texts.  6 book reviews: Rich Dad , Poor Dad (Rich Dad #1), Robert T. Kiyosaki, Sharon L. Lechter  Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter.  It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one 's financial intelligence (financial IQ) to improve one 's business and financial aptitude.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki 's life.       :        2011    :            :              :            1385   270   9646617751           1386       1387           1388   9789646617759       1389       1392       1393                      -   21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            19/09/1399    09/08/1400     .    7 book reviews: Wow, what ideologically driven, poorly written, paternalistic rubbish! Reading this book reminds me of every conversation I ve ever had with a middle-aged, white guy, whose sense of entitlement and self-importance has reached such a critical level that as they lecture you on the reality of life, as they see it, while doing so by telling ridiculous, unrealistic parables that border on the nonsensical  In Kiyosaki s mind, the poor are that way because they are lazy, and spend money in the wrong way. The poor should take their paychecks, and buy some property(!) just like Kiyosaki did (although, he admits, what made him wealthy may not work for most). He also admits that McDonalds is the most popular fast food joint not because they sell a superior product, but because they have a superior business model. The lesson to be taken from this, I guess, is that business is not there to provide a better product than their competitor (seemingly against his libertarian-best widget mythology), but rather, to simply run a business. This is the most refreshing and realistic part of the book; capitalism doesn t care about the product it produces, it s a business for the sake of being a business. Finally, some realism is injected into the fantasy. But it doesn t really bode that well for the idea that competition in a capitalistic economy is based on businesses attempts to produce a better product than other businesses. In fact, it doesn t seem to be about the product at all!  Kiyosaki fails to acknowledge of the role privilege plays in this libertarian game. Although, he does admit that the wealthy  groom  their children for a wealthy lifestyle, anyone with even a small sense of honesty would realize that wealth is easy to create when it is handed to you by mommy and daddy. Kiyosaki s  rich dad  is the one that taught him all these lessons. Kiyosaki s  poor dad  is a highly educated PhD. I m willing to bet Kiyosaki has no idea what it is like to be poor. Kiyosaki lucked into wealth (in large part due to authoring a very badly written a book with a coauthor that sued him) and then going around the world and lecturing people about how if you re not wealthy, its your fault, and if you are, don t worry about the poor, it s their fault.  The  history  (of taxes, socialism, capitalism, et. al.) section of the book is laughable in its ideological assumptions and inaccuracy. But I will spare you. The main point of Kiyosaki s viewpoint, that everyone can be wealthy, is logically inconsistent. Not everyone can be wealthy, because, who would make the wealth? There would be no workers for the wealthy to exploit to increase their own wealth, while patting themselves on the back for what a good rich person they are. This type of faulty logic and inability to accurately comprehend reality should give anyone pause. Especially if this is the type of person you are taking financial advice from.  It is no surprise this clown s hero is Donald Trump. How many bankruptcies has that guy had? It is also no surprise that a regrettably significant number of Goodreads reviews (no fear, they wouldn t have read this far into my review) claim this is the first book they could ever read all the way through. Seriously?  Here is a good review about this fraud himself...  8 book reviews: I have been wanting to read this for a couple of years. After some recent events in my life I wanted to understand the financial thinking of people who were raised wealthy and those who were not. The first chapter was great. The storytelling was simple and informative. It made so much sense to me and I related to it. Then I started Lesson Two: Why Teach Financial Literacy. It was this chapter that I realized that homeboy Kiyosaki is quite pompous. I understand that he was using specific examples in his financial success which is essential for writing a book in this genre but he was just being pretentious and inflated.  It was a line in chapter six that made me halt and decide to put down the book for good. It was an example of how his friend bought a rundown house. Kiyosaki writes \"It was spooky to look at.\" What? did this supposedly financially intelligent man just say, \"It was spooky to look at\"? He did. He 's not worth my time.  I checked out this book at the library. If I would have bought this book I would have made him $16.95 richer and me $16.95 poorer. He does know how to invent money by creating a need. The need is for people to buy his books and products.  Kiyosaki 's lectures and advice may appeal to some but I felt like I was being swindled. I wo not finish this book and will read financial advice from people who are intelligently wealthy, more humbled and less pompous.  9 book reviews: \"Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule.\"  Simple, blunt, and sprinkled with a bit of controversy (according to some), Rich Dad Poor Dad is an important wake up call for all of us...  Review to come.   10 book reviews: Sorry, but this book is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo BS.  The concepts in this book, to me, are common sense and there are no concrete applications to his ideas. Yes, the poor get poorer while the rich get richer, there 's a ground-breaking idea! Yes, most people do not know how to manage their money, we know, so how about telling us how?  The majority of the book is Kiyosaki wanking it, telling us stories about his life (which I do not even think are true).  If you want to learn about personal finance and investment strategies, this is not the book for you.  11 book reviews:                                                     ,                                           ,                                                                                     ,                                                                                                           ,     ,                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                   ,                                         ,                   ...                                                                                         ...  12 book reviews: The signal to noise ratio is not very good in this book. But there are already many useful critical reviews on GR, so, I will just talk about the important takeaways.  It 's a generic self-help book which talks of \"what\" one should do (/not do) and not \"how\". If one is looking for practical advices related to investing, this is not an apt book to pick up.  Important takeaways : 1) Be financially literate. This makes the majority of the content of the book.     2) Have total financial self-reliance vs reliance on managers for investment advices. 3) Buy income generating assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate). Keep liabilities and expenses down. After asset base is good, make speculative investments (big and risky). Investment is not risky, the lack of financial intelligence is. Buy luxuries last. Always ask do I really need to buy this. 4) Learn business systems, sales and marketing skills, become better at communicating, negotiating, handling fear of rejection, fear of losing money and overcoming cynicism. 5)  There is also a short biography of Robert Kiyosaki who definitely had an adventurous childhood. He became part of some small businesses at an early age of 9 and was quite imaginative in identifying opportunities to make money.   I do think that for a generation which grew up with internet and browsing Quora or Medium, most of the content in the book is common knowledge. Also it 's a self-help and not an actual investing book. But it 's a short and simple read and okay to read for a beginner.  Also note that almost all the time when the author uses \"poor\", he is referring to the middle class and not actual poor who do not have access to basic opportunities.   13 book reviews: Read this one in 2004, but maybe I read an earlier edition...  I think I rated this one 5stars. I have to review my journals, it 's been too long, I ca not remember what I have written.  I will be back with this one...   14 book reviews: This is a GREAT book! I can definitely say it changed my life and they way I look at money and finances. For example, my husband and I bought investment properties after I had him read it as well. It is very easy and interesting to read. READ IT! READ IT! READ IT!  Here is one of my favorite lines from it, approximately quoted: \"I have never met a rich man who has not lost a lot of money, but I have met a lot of poor men who have never lost a dime.\" True! SO TRUE. Everytime I lose money in an investment, I remember how much better I am for investing and making my money work for me than just hiding it and hoping nothing bad happens to it.  Also, I loved the story of the young talented writer who came to Robert Kiyosaki and lamented not being able to get published. He told her she was very talented, and that she should take a sales class. She was mortified. SALES? She was a gifted writer, not a lowly salesperson. (I excelled at sales, so I personally already was thinking she was kind of dumb.) Robert Kiyosaki pointed out that the cover if his book said \"Best SELLING author\", not \"Best WRITING author\". She was miffed. He was right.  I saw some other reviews saying they disliked the way he talks about people with tons of education always being poor, as if he is above them and so much smarter. Honestly, there is nothing wrong with having lots of education and still being poor, if that 's all you want. This book is about how to be smart financially, though. Feel free to be poor. I want to be a millionaire soon. So I learn about money. And I love and learn from Robert Kiyosaki, who is great at that.  Lots of people look at him and get annoyed that he is so rich and successful, and do not like him. I instead look at how he is rich and successful, and try to figure out how he did it. Amen.  15 book reviews:                          ...                      ...                                                                                             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ :          :                  .                            .                                                                            ...               ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ :                                                         .                                          : 1 -   2-   3-   4-     5-   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                :                                        ...                                                                                  ...                ...                                                                                          ...                            ...                                                            16 book reviews: Probably the stupidest and most over-hyped book I have ever touched. Rhetorical and Biased. Opinions without any facts.  Kiyosaki tries to convince you that poor are poor because they make bad decisions, or because they just want to remain poor; totally oblivious to the fact that it 's a result of oppression and domination in most places. You ca not just separate economics from politics and then draw conclusions. See Rutger Bregman 's to understand the actual psychology of poverty.  17 book reviews: This book goes on my shelf of four books I read over and over, books I read devotionally. It totally revolutionized my outlook not only on making money, but also on education. I wish everyone would read this. I wish the close-minded, those who graduated from whatever school they attended and have not allowed themselves a new thought since, could break through the stone walls they have erected around their souls and let this in. This message can save our world! I am not exaggerating.  (May 24, 2016) I just finished re-re-re-reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad. From the first chapter it was like watching a fireworks show. The insights! Admittedly, I love seeing things in a new way, and I love having a different take on things. What Kiyosaki has to say on education should be broadcast, read, and studied, and all education systems in the world should take him into account. If a lot more people would read and take to heart his financial advice, I think the world 's economy would be much better. Now I have to go out and live this. And I am starting the book over tomorrow.  18 book reviews: Mr.Kiyosaki could use a little humility. The pompousness in his tone is a bit off-putting. Also, the repeated emphasis on some of his financial \"gems\" gets tiring. Other than that, this was a decent read. 19 book reviews: While driving for the Thanksgiving vacation, my husband and I listened to Robert Kiyosaki s book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, on CD. This book helped us to expand and to think outside the box when it came to money. It gave us many things to think about and other ways to view our finances. I enjoyed it so much that I not only listened to it twice on CD, but also read the book itself.  In his book, Kiyosaki reveals that he had two fatherly perspectives while growing up. His biological father maintained an attitude towards money that kept him struggling financially throughout his life. His friend s father, who he spent a lot of time with, held a different perspective, and ultimately prospered. The two men regarded money differently, which caused young Robert to compare and ponder the different things each dad taught. In doing so, he had to choose which path to follow, rather than just blindly accept what he learned. He applied these principles in his life, and, like his rich dad, prospered financially.  I enjoyed the way Kiyosaki introduced us to both fathers. He puts us in the scene of action, rather than lecturing us, and like he did as a boy, we learn from actions rather than words. This is more successful, I think, than most financial books, which while helpful can be a little boring.  Kiyosaki presents the six lessons that his rich dad taught him, and then expands on them. He provides examples and applications. Much of what he says caused me to change my normal perspective as I considered a different way of thinking. Similarly, as I read, I could see phrases that I and others have used that mark us as  poor.  In fact, over the Thanksgiving holiday, my dad unknowingly repeated about six or seven things that Kiyosaki s  poor dad  had said! These statements have caused me to realign many of my thoughts on money.  As we drove, my husband and I frequently stopped the CD to discuss not only the changes in our thinking but also the inspiration that occurred to us. We began seeking opportunities, rather than just blindly accepting the fact that we were broke. We discussed business opportunities, and chances we could  work to earn  rather than  work for money.   If this book has a failing, it is that it is more of an overview than a how-to. It left me wanting to learn more. However, I understand that Kiyosaki has several other books written that appear to dive into the subject more thoroughly, and I look forward to reading those. Still, this works as a great stepping-off point to make us reconsider our view of financial issues.  This was clear, well-written, and thought-provoking, and left me wanting to learn more. It made for great discussion with my husband, and I felt like we both grew closer as we considered the opportunities around us. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to increase their financial knowledge.  20 book reviews:                                                                                              :                                                                                                     .                                                                         .                                                               .                                 ...                                                                                                                    .  21 book reviews: Fun fact, this book caught my attention because the title looked gay.  I kept reading despite this because I have officially started MBA courses and I recognize that if I wo not find something to love in Business, I will not be able to complete this degree, let alone succeed. That is a shame because people 's amazed faces when I share my degrees is such an ego boost (which I desperately need cause cheers for crippling imposter syndrome).  In short chapters, Kiyosaki shares the financial education he received from \"rich dad\", the father of one of his friends. He compares it to the financial advice his own father gave him. The argument is that most people stay unhappy with their financial situation because they do not own any assets and they end up working for others, rather than for themselves. While his own father encourages him to seek an education and a stable job, his rich father helps him become financially educated.  The book is written in a very accessible way. It 's clear that his target audience is frustrated people who lack knowledge and he definitely manages to make his messages come across. However repetitive, this book is short and easy.  I fear this is the end of positive things I can say on this book. As others have pointed out, Kiyosaki recognizes the importance of professionals and educated people and yet, consistently bashes them. Much of this book is filled with condescending and rude rhetoric towards intellectuals and the working class.  Here 's the thing. Labor is necessary. With this in mind, not everyone will be able to apply these lessons because ultimately, in our current age, you are still going to need someone down the line doing the actual labor. Jeff Bezos can get richer with his assets but his entire company rests on the people working in delivery and packaging. So really, Kiyosaki 's condescension makes little sense. His own company requires lawyers, accountants, etc, who are all educated people. Without workers, both educated and not, Kiyosaki 's \"financial education\" means nothing. He can say these people are in the \"rat race\", that they are forever working for someone else but what he proposes seems to be \"let 's gain wealth on the backs of others!\".  Really, I hesitate to stand behind the \"eat the rich\" crowd but damn, studying business is making me an actual communist.  In fact, I found myself grateful that I am studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics before approaching Business. At least Economics has the dignity to pretend that it 's for the benefit of others, that the market benefits from greed. Business seems to be a field for people who simply want to be rich and powerful without caring about the societal impact of their behavior (whoops, is this the right attitude to succeed in my MBA?).  Now, up until the fifth chapter, I was able to excuse this book as greed inducing and that 's it. However, in the fifth chapter, Kiyosaki gets into taxes. He rightfully points out that rich people do not pay taxes so that the weight of taxes fall on the shoulders of the middle class. At this point, I had hoped Kiyosaki was ready to look at the social impact of his ideas.  Obviously not. Instead, Kiyosaki claims that this will always be the case because the rich are able to evade taxes. This is a confusion of normative and descriptive. It is true that the rich do not pay taxes however, is this what we ideally want? Somehow, Kiyosaki seems to feel that since the rich do tax evasion, we should all strive to be like the rich and evade tax. Does not it make more sense for the government to force the rich to pay the taxes?  Kiyosaki seems to suggest that it 's inevitable that the rich will find loopholes. However, when corporations have such an impact on politics in the US (for example, if you still have some faith in the American democracy,), it should come as surprise to no one that they evade tax. This means that the group who is screwing people over is the rich (*coughs* rich dad is a thief), and not the government, unlike how Kiyosaki wishes to present it.  Then, he talks about healthcare and old age care. Again, he portrays some of the challenges the middle class faces yet he pretty much lost the last bits of my respect when he referred to American healthcare as \"socialized\". My dude, have you looked at other developed democracies?  Really, the American centric nature of this book was too much for me. Like, come on, your defunct welfare state is not something to be proud of. There are other forms of capitalism which are not socialism and do include social benefits. There are other ways to build an economy.  Things do not improve from here. The book ends with more ego-stroking. To conclude, yes, financial education matters but part of financial education should be some form of social thinking. Basically, Economics and Business ca not be studied alone, this is a recipe to creating selfish villains, poor dad was right all along.   - Do not even get me started on his comments on unions. - I just have so much disdain for business. For example, in my reading today, the textbook cheerfully pointed out that some airlines have \"informal job descriptions\" where workers \"pitch in!\". The flight attendants also help clean the plane and the pilots also load luggage so the company is very cost efficient. Or in other words, the airline essentially robs workers fair payment from the labor they do. This should not be applauded. Frankly, this should be illegal, what the heck does an informal job description mean? #Elizabeth_Anderson_is_right - Well, time to continue my finance homework.

By using anecdotes from his life and the lessons he learned from his two father figures, the author explains the difference between the mindset of rich and poor regarding money.  In this book, the author points out the traditional mistakes people make while handling their finances and how the educational system does not focus on financial literacy. Therefore, he encourages people to learn about accounting, financial market, taxes and investing.  One of the fascinating things that stands out in this book is the stark difference between the point of view of the rich and poor person of looking at money. The rich dad sees money in a positive light which is at odds with the popular opinion about money.  Overall, this is an informative book. It made me interested in learning about finance and managing money in a better way. If you want to learn about finance, I highly recommend this book.  24 book reviews: This Review   Blog   Twitter   Instagram   Support me      Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.    I am reading non-fiction books each month and I decided to read more books relating to business because I am genuinely interested in the subject and because I want to take more steps in this field. There are a few huge books when it comes to this field and this book is one of them. There are a lot of mixed reviews about it and I can see why. Simply put, Kiyosaki is an excellent business man but he is a mediocre author.  I can not say that the author who is a multi-millionaire is not an expert when it comes to money because he apparently is. The problem is that what is provided in the book is very basic and if it provided me with anything, it would be motivation rather than concrete knowledge. The author have a few things to say but he stretched them out over more than 200 pages of how people suck when it comes to managing money. How his rich dad  Groomed  him to become successful and then there is the chicken little example the author was very proud of.  The thing is that some of the advice written in the book can only work when there are classes of people, the rich and the poor. If everyone decided to live by the rules in this book then it won t work because it depends on people working with low salaries and shitty circumstances just because they won t fight against it.  Another thing that made me stop and think was the praise that Kiyosaki pours toward Donald Trump and though this was written decades ago and the author is obviously impressed by Trumps financial success, it made me think if money is the sole measurement the author uses in his life. Jump to the last couple of years showed another image of Trump which made the example leave a bitter taste in my mouth!  Long story short is that this is not a life-changing book. It has a few basic concepts that it repeats again and again while crapping on educated people and assuming a very westernized measures about money and success. The reason that made me give this an additional start (two stars instead of one) is that it kind of made me motivated to read and do more!  25 book reviews: 2021- j  update'as, skirtas  iam  edevrui: Mr. Kiyosaki-san, sir, would you be so kind to fuck off?  O dar paskait   it  knyg  su inosit, kad jei j s  t tis nesimaudo piniguose, tai jis lochas ir  iaip i  esm s niekam tik s  mogus. Ties  ia vieta skaitymas ir baig si.  das, ne knyga.

After reading 36 out of 195 pages, I have already gotten a grasp of the overall message (make your money work for you). I have also become bored with it. As a future purveyor of doctorate-level counseling/psychological services (fingers crossed, here), reading the dribble that pop-psychologists, self-made millionaires, and the like are allowed to put into print nauseates me. I will admit freely that self-help books can be and are a legitimate help to many people. But the fact that Kiyosaki continues to make so much money off of a book full of relatively obvious \"revelations\" is off-putting to say the least.  This book will sit on my bedside table a few more days for the sake of my father 's dignity. But I will be damned if I spend another spare moment reading it.  29 book reviews: The life changing book that has been a personal finance best seller for over a decade written by author Robert T. Kiyosaki. This little book has changed the lives of many people and their perspective on money, who are in misery, not knowing how to make ends meet due to lack of financial education. The contents of this book, tells the story of a young man, who is the author himself, being brought up by his natural father the conventional way of getting a job, saving every penny, working hard and climbing the corporate ladder. At the same time, he also had a \"second father\" who taught him a different way to view things and how to start from scratch and build his business into an empire.  I am sure many of us can relate to the story on the part where we were being brought up the conventional way to become workers. As much as we do not wish it to be that way, ironically, the education system plays a very big part in educating our fathers and their fathers to be trained into workers instead of educating them and inspire them to become business owners. Ignorance of other available choices, we are trapped in a eternal cycle of working for money, saving up and spending on wasting assets that constantly drains our finances and loses value over time. Welcome to the rat race! Unless we learn and educate ourselves on personal finance, we will be unknowingly stuck with only one way of thinking, and passing that knowledge on to the next generation. Talk about vicious cycle!  The main point of this book is to educate yourself on personal finance, which is to learn how to become financially independent by making money work hard for you and not you working hard to earn every single penny. It teaches you that you do not have to be a slave to money and to turn the situation to your advantage. There is no need for you to work for another person if you do not want to, in order to fulfill what you want in life. You are in control of your situation and you no longer need to take orders from anyone. You decide how much work you need. You are your own boss!  This book has certainly made a huge impact on my life, why not read it and see if it will change yours as well? Make that difference now.  Review by Ben Ang  Article Source:  ",
    " Run, Rose, Run: A Novel": "book reviews: This was a better book than I expected. To be honest, the plot is not very original and I could outline the story easily after reading just a little of the book.... but the characters in the plot were well-drawn, detailed, and held my interest. I would guess that the solid story line came from Patterson, but all the detail and insight that makes it ring true come from Parton 's long participation in the world of country living and music. She 's been around --- and it is the key to the story and book. A good paring, well done.  1 book reviews: An awesome audio book. Dolly reading is great and made her character really come alive. Great story. 2 book reviews: Think Hallmark movie. Dolly herself reading it makes it! 3 book reviews: Loved the book, great read ",
    " The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story": "book reviews: What a ripoff! Conservatives promised me a racist anti-american tirade and all I got was this deeply researched history of black people 's struggles and contributions to our democracy and culture, and how there are many disparities stemming from slavery that still need to be fixed. I want my money back dammit! 1 book reviews: For those who premise that Historians write truth, I, as an Historian, will boldly disagree. Historians write perspective that is grounded in the interpretation of Primary Source Documents created by people   ordinary people, powerful people, people who did, people who observed, and people who had no voice. Rather than attacking this book for not telling the  Truth  or as undermining the mainstream story of our nation,  The 1619 Project is a much needed opportunity for a candid and painful conversation about race in our nation. The contributors to this book are outstanding in their fields and provide cogent and thoughtful parts of this book. Their voices (and so many others) need to be added to the canon of American History and we owe it to History to consider their value in telling the American story.  2 book reviews: Read it. Read it because a lot of people do not want you to, and the fact that they do not want you to should tell you something powerful is at work here. And it is. This collection of articles is simply amazing, and no matter what someone might want to think about the conclusions being drawn from these stories, no one can deny the obviously verifiable facts found within them. Whether you think America is still the same nation today that it was in the 16, 18 or 19 hundreds, what ca not be denied is the importance and the power of learning the stories of the enslaved people and the victims of horrible racist violence throughout that history. Too often we only listen to the part of the story told by those still living to tell it, but by presenting the stories of actual lynchings, The 1619 Project at least reframes the conversation around the source and outcomes of that violence. Read it, even though it 's hard. Read it precisely because it 's hard. But for love of God, Read This Book!  3 book reviews: Audiobook .read by a full cast of authors. Voice narrator .Nikole Hannah-Jones, and full cast.  .18 hours and 57 minutes long   This is our national truth: America would not be America without the wealth from black labor, without black striving.. . So much . . . that we export to the world, that draws the world to us, comes forth from Black Americans m that is Black Americans  Legacy to the nation . . . We cannot change the hypocrisy upon which we were found it . . . But we can atone for it. We can acknowledge the crime. And we can do something to try to set things right, to erase the hardship and hurt of so many of our fellow Americans . . . None of us can be held responsible for the wrongs of our ancestors. But if today we choose not to do the right and necessary thing, THAT burden we own . . . Yes we are to be redeemed, we must . . . finally live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded .  A successful purpose .  It aims to reframe the countries history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.  The ugly truth is really ugly. The project angers - it also encourages positive change.  5 stars  4 book reviews: In this expanded version of the 2019 New York Times magazine of the same name, Nikole Hannah-Jones and a collection of scholars, journalists, and poets tell the story of how slavery and its legacy has shaped and impacted America across many facets of American life since the White Lion ship came ashore in Virginia in 1619 carrying at least 20 Africans onboard. Prose and poetry are used throughout the book to show slavery 's lingering impact on topics such as: democracy, church, healthcare, medicine, self-defense, politics, traffic and so much more. Hannah-Jones the creator of the project is a powerful writer. Her writing opens and closes the book where she focuses on issues of Democracy and Justice, she did not come to play with those chapters. In them she makes the case for how Black people have been crucial in the establishment and expansion of our democracy and as a result have a right to be patriotic about this country; while at the same time makes the case for why Black people must have reparations. It is a well-researched book that is written in an accessible way for a general audience. A perfect book for book clubs and group discussions. It is my hope that this book as whole or its part has an impact on our society in the same way that Du Bois s Black Reconstruction in America motivated civil rights activists to change and shape America for the better and as it also began to change the racist historical narrative of Reconstruction that was told by the Dunning school. The 1619 Project and other works that have been released in the last decade, many of which are cited in this book, have the potential to also shape how Americans view America s past and our present moment.  5 book reviews: Marvelous essays with a scatter of poetry and fiction to add a personal touch. I learned new things and gained perspective I had not considered. History is an infinite experience that varies from person to person. The only way to truly understand history is to see it from as many perspectives as possible. The desire to ban perspective is stupid. Yet this book an educational textbook has become a forbidden document in many schools.  I should be shocked by all the book banning, but of course I am not. Reading this book makes me even less surprised because it 's clear the same tactics to silence certain voices have been used for centuries. I only hope that the Americans who are mad at the 1619 Project will actually read it before developing an opinion. If you read it and it still makes you mad, that 's your decision. But at least your decision will be based on something real.  Side note, the audiobook is highly recommended. Great performances by a full cast.  6 book reviews: I deleted the review. It was an interesting experiment. Please move on . Have a nice day y all. 7 book reviews: Thanks PRH/One World for the advanced copy. I m about 70 pages in and this is clearly the most important American History book written to date. Essential for all High School, Academic, and Public Libraries 8 book reviews: 4.25 Stars rounded up  I have read this twice and enjoyed it both times. This has multiple contributors and is able to more than adequately defend its views and claims. That said its not radical and is inaccurate in regards to capitalism ever being good or a benefit. Chattel slavery ties directly to capitalism and ca not be removed from it. This is liberal but moderate despite the right wing emotionally rabid response to it.  9 book reviews: Even though the Adam Hochschild published the review in the New York Times Book Review, I strongly recommend reading his review.  I read most of this in the NY Times magazine format when it first came out. This books expands on that and addresses some of the legit criticisms from the first publication.  Honesty, you should read this. The book is not a straight forward history, more of an argument for rethinking how we look at history and frame the US origin myth. Considering how much some, if not most, US schools leave out, this is an important bit.  Those who take issue with the history presented in this book either are not widely read on American history and/or have not taken an American history class outside of high school. The history here is widely available in other sources, some of which are footnoted/cited. As such, this book is more of an introduction or a push to get more people to think beyond the traditional myth. You may argue with the 1619 date (you could ask, for instance, why not a date from when the Europeans stole the land?) but you cannot deny the outsized impact that Virigina had on the development of the country in the beginning. Just like it should be impossible for the average person to not acknowledge the impact that slavery had and still has on this country.  Look, huge parts of this country have had American history taught to them via text books that were approved by the Daughters of the Confederacy. Think about that before you call this collection of essays propaganda. The history here is not \"new\" the point- that it should be more widely known, that the origin frame story should be change is the new bit. And it is about time, really.  Towards the end of the book, in her closing essay, Nikole Hannah-Jones writes, \"we must do what is just: we must finally live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded\". That 's the point. Being willfully blind to the history that includes slavery and racism, does not do this. This book provides a framework to dismantle that willful blindness and learn more.  10 book reviews: The 1619 project is a politically motivated story  U.S. history documents the success of American revolutionaries in establishing a new nation for freedom and prosperity. The Founding Fathers were at enormous odds to fight a formidable enemy to end English authority in colonial America. But author Nikole Hannah-Jones, calls her work the 1619 Project named after the arrival of first Africans on American soil. And she seeks to place slavery at the center of American history. According to her, the reason for the declaration of independence from England was colonial America wanted to protect the institution of slavery when abolitionist sentiment grew in England. The story of American founding fathers in this book is different from what we find in the U.S Constitution or American history. It portrays slavery as a uniquely American phenomenon and the revolutionary war was fought to preserve slavery. Hannah-Jones proclaims that Black Americans  struggle made American democracy real. She claims that the U.S. Constitution gave ironclad protections to slavery without mentioning it. How is that possible when the constitution explicitly states that  all men are created equal.  There are other factual errors, enslavement did not start in 1619 but it was present decades before that.  Quakers comprised of only white population fiercely opposed slavery since colonial days and they were active in freeing slaves, documenting their stories, and connecting freed slaves with long lost relatives. American Revolution was kindled in New England, where anti-slavery sentiment was strongest. Early patriots like James Otis, John Adams, and Thomas Paine were opposed to slavery, and the revolution helped to fuel abolitionism in the North.  The publication of 1619 Project by the New York Times demonstrates that it does not care about the truth, as it has progressively moved to the Far-Left of the political spectrum. It hires and promotes journalists who belong to the woke culture, they misinterpret facts and glorify racism. This is an effort to falsify the history that focus on Black issues rather than the class conflict that occurred prior to 1776. The 13 states were deeply divided over the property right issues, economy, wealth and how a federal government may dominate individual states. The NY Times project is a conspiracy theory developed from the chair of ultimate cultural privilege in America that tries to discredit the American values. The book is malicious and inaccurate which offers a distorted economic history, misrepresents the intentions of Founding Fathers, and the legacy of President Abraham Lincoln.  The 1619 Project curriculum is not an educational enterprise. It is a tool of political indoctrination. Since its publication, school students in all 50 states have been taught parts of its curriculum. The core of the social justice training uses the ideologies Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the Marxism. To teach children that the American Revolution was fought to strengthen slavery would result in misunderstanding the American Revolution, and the loss of one million lives during American Civil War that ended slavery. The future American population will have the notion that their country is racist since day one. Currently, the 1619 Project applies a wide-ranging topics like the broken healthcare system, crime, American music, and the wealth gap.  11 book reviews: This is a great book to have and read slowly. It is a combination of history, essays, poems, historical blurbs, that traces the Black American experience since 1619 through the present day. I get why so many people do not like The 1619 Project. It is an unflinching look at some of the terrible things that Americans have done to each other because of the color of someone 's skin. You read this and you tell yourself that we have progressed and we have. But we still strive to make a more perfect union for all Americans. And it 's plain to see by this compilation, Black Americans are still struggling to get on the same footing as White Americans. I loved how the book was put together and the 18 different chapters that we get into. I think that some of the essays/poems are honestly what hit me the hardest in some cases. I wish that we had gotten a second book that just had poems/essays based on The 1619 Project with maybe some art included. That would be an awesome coffee table book.  My favorite essay was by Berry Jenkins called \"Troubled Water\" where he tells the story of a slave named Gabriel in the 1800s. Gabriel was 24 years old and was an enslaved blacksmith held captive on a forced labor camp by Thomas Prosser in Henrico County, Virginia. He organized and planned a rebellion. After others shared details about the plot, \"Gabriel 's Rebellion\" is thwarted. He is later tried, found guilty, and hanged.  My favorite poem was by Tim Seibles called \"Before His Execution\" which is a poem about Denmark Vesey. He was a free Black man. He and 5 others were captured and put on trial for planning a rebellion. He was executed.  My favorite chapter was chapter 8, \"Citizenship\" I loved the history in this one and it was interesting to find out things I never knew like there was a Colored Convention movement that started in 1830. They started discussing many of the so-called \"Black\" laws and the prospect of leaving the United States. I found out about Hezekiah Grice who organized the Legal Rights Association, which aimed to prove that Black Americans were citizens.  Most shocking history blurb was \"July 30, 1866\"    Another shocking one goes into Black Wall Street which I already knew about as well as the blurb about Emmett Till.  12 book reviews: Good primer. Most of this history is well known and uncontroversial to serious history readers but having it all in one place is useful. Given the excellent writing, it is not surprising it has become a lightning rod. 13 book reviews: It s kind of funny that this book is so controversial. Maybe I m more radicalized than I thought but none of this felt like a huge overturning of what I knew of American history, at least the major parts. The 1619 Project looks at Black history, which is American history, in order to broaden our understanding of our country s founding and progress. It adds a lot of nuance to American history, forcing its readers to look at how slavery, anti-slavery, and black lead civil rights movements have influenced us from the start. A lot of reviews chastise this collection of essays of being a  myopic  or  reductive  or  tunnel vision  view of history but our current view of American history is reductive if we ignore (out of shame or ignorance or whatever) that slavery was a major factor in the foundation of the country. The book is a mix of nonfiction essays and fiction pieces, which I loved. You get meticulously researched, through essays, then emotionally evocative poetic or prosaic reflection upon the same topic.  I flip flopped between reading & listening and both options are great experiences:  Physical book pros: Pictures! Footnotes! Notes, references and an index in the back!  Audio book pros: A lot of the essays are read by their respective authors, including the poetry, which is great!  14 book reviews: Slavery arrived on America 's shores well before the Founding Fathers - 1619 in Virginia. This is an expanded book based on a groundbreaking piece that appeared in the New York Times Magazine. Including 18 essays, 36 poems and a variety of fiction, it had my attention from the first page. Starting from that first slave ship through modern day all aspects of slavery and oppression are explored as well as daily life, society, the arts and politics. I was absorbed by the essay that discussed how our forefathers denied basic rights to African slaves while stealing land from all the indigenous tribes to further the white expansion and keep the top spot in the caste system. Unlike African Americans however, the Native People were given some rights but only after they converted to Christianity and further rewarded for taking slaves. We can only hope that this tome will open dialogue and foster understanding. This works for readers of books on social change as well as historians. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy.  15 book reviews: This is a must-read.  Like, every single American needs to have this in their hands and have read it. Require it in schools, require it everywhere. Gift it to your conservative family members who are racist as hell. Give it to your liberal whyte family members who are colorblind and practice tolerance.  Give it to all others, so we can have to smashed into our faces like we do the puppy who pees on the carpet for the 50th time that racism in America is baked into its foundations and spins like a pernicious weed throughout every single system within this country.  16 book reviews: The United States is a nation founded on both an ideal and a lie. Our Declaration of Independence, approved on July 4, 1776, proclaims that \"all men are created equal\" and \"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" But the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of Black people in their midst. A right to \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" did not include fully one-fifth of the new country. Yet despite being violently denied the freedom and justice promised to all, Black Americans believed fervently in the American creed. Through centuries of Black resistance and protest, we have helped the country live up to its founding ideals. And not only for ourselves Black rights struggles paved the way for every other rights struggle, including women 's and gay rights, immigrant and disability rights.  Without the idealistic, strenuous, and patriotic efforts of Black Americans, our democracy today would look very different; in fact, our country might not be a democracy at all.  documents the reality of the history of the United States through a collection of essays, poems, and short stories. This project is one of the most cohesive and eloquent collections of information on the true birth of the United States and its ideals; from 1619 when the first enslaved men and women set foot on what would be known as the United States to today when people are fighting for that very information to be hidden.  The United States of America is a myth. We know freedom isn t free and we know the  American dream  is just propaganda. is a plea for you to realize this, a plea to pay attention and consume Truth.    Who lives up to the true potential of the United States? The founding enslavers that hypocritically preach freedom or the enslaved that believe in and fight for freedom?  Much of the information provided in is not new. Much of it is obvious if you pay attention and open yourself (with the privilege of access) to an education. What does is provide a cohesive whole that gives easy access to information that is vital but hard to find because it is so scattered. My opinions and principles have not changed, they have been reinforced. What has changed for me is my ability to better argue for Truth because I now have a more firm foundation to uphold my knowledge.  If someone tells you not to read something, please read it as soon as you can. Don t let them lie. Don t let them manipulate. Listen to both sides of an argument. provides the other side of the argument that has been purposefully omitted for hundreds of years.  The people that challenge books like this don t do so because they believe them to be false. They do so because they believe the knowledge is dangerous for themselves their power, their wealth, their politics. When someone is aware of the truth, they are then capable of refuting the lie. Ignorance is a foundation for manipulation. If ignorance benefits you, then you are the problem.  Why would a specific group of people fear easy access to education and books? Because knowledge destroys their base.  Those that seek to deny rights to others are not true Americans. Those that seek equality and access are representative of the true face of the United States of America. The true ideal that America was made to represent.    America has many faults: the plague that is capitalism, the imperialism, the poverty, the enslavement, the genocide, etc, etc, etc  But America represents an ideal that can be achieved by those that do not deny its history and it s failings. Hypocrites preach from the highest perch. But Truth can bring it down.   17 book reviews: Fake propaganda 18 book reviews: I am giving myself 30 minutes to write this review before I start my next tasks for work, because I finished this book last night and I ca not stop thinking about it.  The controversy surrounding this collection is somewhat interesting to me. Nothing makes people want to read a book more than to tell them they SHOULDN'T read it. But... As someone who has been on something of a mission to educate myself on social issues, and more relevantly to this book, race, racism, white privilege, and the many ways that those concepts manifest in American society, this was always going to be a book I would want to read.  And I learned so much, despite the fact that much of it was repetitive (I will come back to this in a sec) and despite the fact that I think there was quite a few things left out that could have been included, this was highly informative and, maybe more importantly, an excellent contextual narrative that shows how each decision, and policy, and practice, and attitude formed and influenced the next... leading us to where we are now.  Ibram X. Kendi 's essay \"Progress\" was especially eye opening for me, because despite all of the reading I have done on this topic, I still bought into the fallacy that racial equality was inevitable, and that all the commentary saying \"We have come so far, but we still have a ways to go\" is a red herring. On a surface level, it 's true. We have come very far, and there 's still work to be done. But what Kendi argues in his essay is that this statement does two things - 1) it implies that life is much better now for Black people in this country, and 2) it defers the actual continuing and continual work of achieving racial equality to some mythical future when it will just... *poof* BE. It removes accountability for WORKING toward this goal, and just implies that, through the magic of inevitability, eventually things will be fair and just. We have to just be patient. (And by \"we\", the implication is that Black people need to just be patient. More patient, forever patient. Unendingly patient.)  This essay struck me strongly because I bought into the idea that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. And I WANT so much to believe that, but it 's meaningless unless WE PUT IN THE WORK TO MAKE IT SO. And therein lies the problem. These statements are sort of nebulous future promises that imply that we can sit back and not worry about it, because the future will be better, regardless.  Edit to make sure that my meaning is crystal clear here: When I say \"we need to put in the work\" I mean white people. Black people have ALWAYS put in the work. White people have, historically, implied that the reluctant, truculent, resentful, often miniscule concessions to equal rights granted to Black people in the last 400+ years are enough, and they are not. White people say it now to basically use it to avoid any responsibility for doing anything because we have already done \"so much\". We have not done nearly enough.  And now I am down to 3 minutes on my timer. Dang it.  OK, this collection is wonderful and covers a massive amount of information spanning, obviously, hundreds of years of Black history and culture in the US. As the essays contained here were written by different people, some of them obviously overlapped, or touched on similar topics or events. Hence the repetition I mentioned earlier. But, while usually that sort of repetition is a negative for me, in this case, it really brought home how everything was linked and affected the whole tapestry of this history, right up to present day.  This is an incredible collection, and I highly recommend reading it, or, if you can, LISTEN to it. I listened to most of this while walking my neighborhood nightly, and I loved hearing these essays written by those who wrote them, and while they were not all what I would call professional voice talent, it 's worth it to hear their inflections and their voices telling these stories. Plus, there 's more than a few poems mixed in, and listening to them was far preferable to me than reading them (my eyes just do not do verse - sorry literature!).  Speaking of poetry, the section on Music really brought home why poetry and spoken word is such an important part of Black culture, specifically how minstrelsy (the Jim Crow/blackface kind, not the medieval lute playing kind) was so problematic that it led to changes in Black performances, so as to be differentiated from the racist imitations.  There are so many eye-opening things like this in this collection. I really ca not recommend it enough.  19 book reviews: Do yourself a favor and skip this one 20 book reviews: I graduated from High School in 2010 from a school in Upstate NY that did an excellent job teaching us about the history of African Americans in America. I learned correctly about the absolute brutality and down right evil that was inflicted upon those who were literally stolen from their homes and sold as property. I learned about the grueling middle passage as well as about the unrelenting labor they were forced to endure day in and day out with absolutely no regard to these men and women as image-bearers of God.  I also learned about the Underground Railroad and the brave abolitionists (both black and white) who took great risks to see men and women freed from their prisons. I still remember even from an elementary school age learning songs in music class such as  Follow the Drinking Gourd  and their significance to our history.  With all of that being said, I appreciate being reminded once more of the atrocities of our past as a nation in this book  we must never forget or seek to diminish this great stain caused by sin and absolute depravity.  Why, then, would I offer only two stars for this work?  Because although it is littered with historical truths (and many that I was not aware of), I cannot get past the subjective commentary that seeks to further divide an already divided culture.  What s just as surprising as what you do find in this work is what you don t find  grace and forgiveness. Even the slightest admission to a white man s involvement in the American journey toward African American freedom and civil rights is immediately walked back with three reasons why their help wasn t really in good faith  really?  I read this book because I wanted to know why Republicans and the right were so against it. Although the words  critical theory  don t appear in this work, the tone is clearly one of  us  (the oppressed) vs  them  (the oppressors). It s blatantly obvious that at least some of the authors of these works were heavily influenced by the works of Karl Marx.  Why is it so hard for us to see that no one wins if it s oppressors vs the oppressed? What do we gain by the oppressed overcoming the oppressors only to in-turn become the oppressors in a new age of an endless cycle of turmoil?  There is another way to see this world:   our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms  (Ephesians 6:12).  There is a sickness in ALL of us that so many are trying to define. Some call it  systemic racism , but I see ALL of our insistence to show partiality to one another; through race, sex, social status, income status, physical appearance, cognitive ability, ethnicity, etc, as a symptom of our deeper disease (James 2).  We all know that this world is truly broken in far more than one way. But do you know that the bill always comes due? Justice will be exacted for every egregious action and every careless word we have spoken regardless of our pigmentation.  The good news is that you and I don t have to make our defense before The Judge without representation. But it s our choice. Are we going to plead our case explaining how our good outnumbered our bad and hope He agrees? Or are we going to see, like so many before us, that the cost of that debt we add to daily is more than we can pay and put our trust in One who advocates for us on our behalf because of what He, alone, accomplished?  Read this book. You will learn something and hopefully you ll walk in the shoes of some of these incredible Americans who overcame so much and at the end of the day were able to raise an American flag and be proud to live in this Country despite the evil overshadowing it s past, like Nikole s father.  But ask yourself if dehumanizing an entire group of people based on skin pigment is really the solution to the damage that has already been done by some who had  and some who do today blindly do the same. Is that really what we want to instill in our kids and in their kids? Is this really the answer?  21 book reviews: Selective view of history. 22 book reviews: Anyone interested in American history should be interested in African American history, and scholarly thought over the past forty years or so has built a strong basis for the idea that what used to be called  the Negro problem  stands at the center of U.S. history, past and present. The nation s prosperity, northern as much as southern, was built on uncompensated labor, mostly the labor of Black people, and slavery and its aftermath have driven much of the nation s policy debates up to the present, in terms that limit our ability to achieve our national aspirations. This is a view no longer controversial or even fresh among historians, but it has not sunk into the public consciousness to any great extent.   both in its original form in the and in the expanded book form presented here has done a lot to raise the profile of this idea, though a lot of the discussion it has sparked has been misleading, reductionist, or defensive. That s a pity, because it s a very well-reasoned and reasonable argument well supported by documentation. But like so many hot-button issues in the United States, it has not been well served by exposure to the popular consciousness, which magnifies cartoon versions of ideas and obsesses about details.  This book does make a laudable attempt to present a comprehensive survey of the ways slavery and post-slavery policies affecting Black people are central to our history, but in the present form has its flaws. One of the flaws lies in its conception, as a team-produced effort of essays by multiple authors, punctuated by poems and short creative-writing pieces. Reading it reminded me of my early years in academic publishing, when every other volume seemed to be a  a collection of essays in honor of a senior scholar. Those books, like this one, included essays of uneven quality and so much repetition that they were painful to read as a single volume. Here, certain historical moments are described over and over again; this reader found them painful and traumatic enough on a single reading, and their lessons easily enough absorbed, without the recurrent pain of the third and fourth and fifth recounting. The intensity combined with repetition ultimately led me to read only about a chapter a day, which made the process somewhat more manageable. As for the poetry and creative-writing bits that led into each chapter, I felt they detracted from the didactic integrity of the work. Many of them were very well written and most very moving, so rather than eliminate them altogether I would have preferred to see them in a short companion volume partnered with the main one. But I ve always been resistant to genre-mixing, so that might just be my personal bias.  There were some standout chapters I d like to see every American read:  Capitalism, Punishment,  and  Progress  were especially enlightening for me, eloquent and persuasively argued. And Nikole Hannah-Jones s pieces at the beginning and end establish the framework well. Someone coming to this subject for the first time, however, might prefer a book written by a single author, such as by Clint Smith, even though a single volume can t address as many aspects of the issue as this one does. Then progress to dipping into this book, and if you get really engaged, check the extensive endnotes in this volume for other titles focusing on particular subjects.  23 book reviews: (An 1872 portrait of African-Americans serving in Congress (from left): Hiram Revels, the first black man elected to the Senate; Benjamin S. Turner; Robert C. De Large; Josiah T. Walls; Jefferson H. Long; Joseph H. Rainy; and R. Brown Elliot)  \"Our founding ideals of liberty and equality were false when they were written.\"  \"I had been taught, in school, through cultural osmosis, that the flag wasn t really ours, that our history as a people began with enslavement and that we had contributed little to this great nation.\"  \"Anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country, as does the belief, so well articulated by Lincoln, that black people are the obstacle to national unity.\" In the book    The book is well researched regarding facts and historical landmarks pertaining to the once opressed and enslaved black men and women since 1619. It is a reminder to Americans that some (noble) ideals took time to become reality for a section of the population. Very true.  But, framing Jefferson for being a hypocrite it is a hard stance, on Hannah 's side. I do not believe so. Jefferson had life-contradictions. Sure. Who did not have, at that time? (or now?) Lincoln had them too. That does not invalidate the noble ideals [namely that \"all men are created equal\"] ensconsed within the Declaration of Independence. Granted, he was an idealist. But his ideals were good: \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". Who does not want those ideals to become true? Plainfully, some day?  Hannah 's suggestion that year 1619 was even more important than 1776 is, for sure, another negative aspect of the book. 1619, when the first African slaves arrived to Virginia.   (Newsweek, February 24th 1997. I bought the issue)  The Project was polemic* in the USA, not only at the educational level, some seeing in it a way to teach Critical Race Theory in schools.    This sentence by Nikole Hannah-Jones seems problematic as well: \"But the real goal of the project,..., is to get  white people to give up whiteness.  ** She believes in the \"control of [collective] memory\" via the teaching of History.  I think she should consider Asian-Americans in her analysis, as well. Maybe she will arrive at different conclusions. I do recommend \"An Inconvenient Minority\" by Kenny Xu.  *  **In:   UPDATE    UPDATE    UPDATE   24 book reviews: For those who follow U.S. news and current events, \"The 1619 Project\" is likely familiar - the NYT journalistic effort organized by the claim that the start of the slave trade was the start and defining ethos of America. The controversies surrounding the project are likely familiar as well, including the volley of responses from lay and academic critics. My sympathies are definitively with those critics.  is a transparent revisionist attempt to do history as a variant of literary criticism - essentially an editorial review of the American Canon but of cultural myths instead of texts. Hannah-Jones and her colleagues aim to provide a \"questioning\" of hegemonic popular myths, such as America 's inevitable social progress on race relations, the material bounty of liberal democratic capitalism, and whether America actually is a vaunted democracy. The authors generally argue that this teleological and optimistic view of America entrenches white dominance and black oppression, accounting for enduring disparities despite the legal defeat of all forms of institutional racism. They in turn assert America 's original sins of slavery, institutional racism (i.e. Jim Crow), and racial hierarchy (i.e. wealth and health gaps) have not been sufficiently repented for nor has the role of Black Americans been properly recognized by the white majority.  I applaud for their academic interest and ethical concerns about disparities and differences between groups, though I think the racial aspect is poorly defined in this work and generally by society, and I was happy to see that many of the authors are still somewhat committed to certain core American ideals. However, the project itself is riddled with fatal flaws. Primarily, it is not history in any real sense of history as an actual scholastic discipline. The authors are not deeply concerned with applying a scientific epistemology, comprehensively exploring the historical record and socioeconomic context without applying 21st century ethics, or participating in an open and level debate about interpretation and meaning of the salient takeaways from said historical record. is a hodgepodge work largely of cultural criticism or sloppy economic analysis that draws on a particular perspective of American history, and it dogmatically insists that this is the only ethically correct perspective. Superior works on these same topics can easily be found - most mainstream, non-polemical scholarship, journalism, or popular books before \"The Great Awokening\" (circa 2014) will be more edifying.  There are also gallingly hypocritical (i.e. retributive justice for thee, restorative justice for me) and disastrously partisan elements in this collection that make the work hard to take seriously. Ultimately, the application of radical subjectivity so as to re-write cultural myths and then pass them off as legitimate history is destructive to pedagogical and scholastic ends. We should strenuously resist politicizing these institutions even if we think that such an effort is impossible or that the institutions are already politicized; political efforts should be labeled as such and subsequently should not be foregrounded in the paper of record.  25 book reviews: This book contains so much factually false information it should be classified as fiction. The author attacks US history through the lens of a racist and fails to present any real evidence to back up their conclusions. Waste of time, which I could get my money back. 26 book reviews: Thought-provoking and informative. 27 book reviews: a phenomenal body of work. read it for your own good (I recommend the audiobook!) and definitely to spite the white supremacists that don t want you to.  thank you to libro.fm, the author, and the publisher for an alc of this book! 28 book reviews: Honestly, this book should be required reading in all US schools.  It is so incredibly well crafted, with a mix of factual articles and essays mixed in with poetry and flash fiction, all wrapped up in chronological order from when enslaved people first were brought against their will to this continent to the 2021 Insurrection at the US Capitol last year.  It spans over topics such as medical myths and mistreatment to how much chattel slavery has built the foundation of the US to mass incarceration.  Everything weaves together so well and it really opened my eyes to a lot that I did not realize and its such an important tool on my anti-racism journey.  I highly, highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to continue to work on themselves on being a better ally to the Black community but also to anyone who maybe does not know where to start and is looking for a comprehensive book to cover a lot of undiluted history.  As an aside, the reason I picked this book up to read now was because the church we have been visiting had a 6 week zoom course over this book and the topics discussed within it. Each week had a different guest speaker from the Black community to talk about the topic of the week and to help educate those of us on the zoom calls and to really delve into these topics discussed in the book and the effects that they have had throughout the years. We listened to the 1619 podcast and read excerpts and extra articles and information along the way and reading this book and talking about these things with a group like that was really such an enhancement to my reading experience of this book. Sometimes we have to sit in the uncomfortable feelings and really reflect on them instead of pushing them away, and getting to talk about it with others was a good way to do that for me.  29 book reviews: As expected, this book gave me a lot to think about. I don t know how I overlooked the original 1619 Project in the New York Times magazine in 2019, but I am glad I did not miss this book. Kudos to Nikole Hannah-Jones and all the editors and contributors for putting together such a well-researched and thought-provoking analysis of the continuing harmful legacy of American chattel slavery. The book is a collection of eighteen essays, which are comprehensive in the topics covered and dense with historical information while exploring the legacy of slavery in America. The essays are interwoven with poems and works of fiction to highlight and illuminate key moments in history. The editing is impressive. Despite the numerous contributors, the book is decidedly cohesive and on-message rather than feeling like just a collection of a number of different voices.  I really appreciate that the last chapter shares the editor 's opinion on a solution for correcting some of the damage done by slavery and moving America forward to a more equitable future. I enjoy reading books about complex societal problems in order to educate myself on the issues and understand what might be done differently to achieve a better outcome. However, I have read a lot of books that lay out the issues nicely but then stop short of sharing proposed solutions. I gain a lot of interesting (and often frustrating) knowledge, but I am left with a feeling of \"ok, now what?\" Hannah-Jones did not leave me hanging, and I believe her thoughts in the final chapter are necessary for pushing the conversation forward. Rather than just closing out the book with a general \"this is a hard problem to solve\", she leaves the reader with a thought process that they are well-equipped for after reading the book: \"Do I agree with her solution? Would it fix the issues of inequality addressed in the book? If not, why not? Are there any other solutions that might work?\"  This is a well-written, comprehensive, and thoughtful presentation of a complex part of American history, and I can see myself revisiting this book many times in the future to review the information and conclusions. Highly recommended.  ",
    " The Complete Maus: A Survivor's Tale (Pantheon Graphic Library)": "book reviews: oh my god.    This burrowed it 's way deep into my heart. This made me feel so much. This was an experience, not just a \"read\". This was real and I ca not even explain how this affected me because it was the most emotional thing I have ever read. Not made-up emotion. This was REAL and it affected me.  Vladek. He reminded me of my Grandfather, a little. I loved my Grandfather and I loved Vladek. His story, as told to his son Art Spiegelman, was one of the most powerful stories I have ever experienced.  This was a story about survival and deep love. The love shown between Vladek and Anja mesmerized me and broke my heart seeing them go through so much cruelty and suffering.    The Complete Maus are two graphic novels combined to form the story of Vladek Spiegelman 's life during World War 2. It is drawn masterfully in beautiful black and white. Jewish people are drawn as mice, German people are drawn as cats, Polish people are drawn as pigs and people from the U.S are drawn as dogs.  From Wikipedia:   One of my favourite parts of Maus was the relationship between Art and Vladek. Art has a lot of guilt over having such an easy life when his parents went through a hell he could not even imagine. Even so, Art and Vladek have a pretty normal father/son relationship. I felt so bad for Vladek at times with the way Art would treat him but it was a normal father/son relationship in the way that sons do not always treat their fathers the best.  Despite this, you could feel the love radiating from the pages. The love Art and Vladek had for each other. I loved the little funny moments in the novel, like when Vladek throws out Art 's coat and gives him a \"warm\" coat, which Art hates because it is not fashionable. Or when Vladek goes to the supermarket to return an open box of cereal, along with other used/opened groceries.  Just the way Art draws his disapproving father made me smile. It was done with such warmth and love. Art 's father was definitely a very funny man, even if he did not mean to be. I loved Vladek so much and in the last few pages, you are shown a picture of Vladek during World War 2. At that moment, I had to stop myself from crying because after reading his incredible story, I saw a picture of the actual Vladek. And it instantly broke my heart. I felt so much love for him, it was unreal.  This story is not a pleasant one but it is incredible. It 's not easy to read at times but it 's essential. It 's about so many things. If you read this and it does not affect you, you are heartless.  I recommend it to everyone. Seriously. Even if graphic novels are not usually your thing. This is my favourite graphic novel now. There is no way that can change now. This was unforgettable and deeply moving. I LOVED it with all my heart and ca not even properly express the love.  Read it. Do not miss out on something so emotional and powerful. I hope you love it like I do.  1 book reviews: The young Adolf Hitler applied twice for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, and each time was rejected. One may dream, though: had he been successful, he might have had a different fate, and, as a result, Europe s history might have taken some other shape  Sixty years later, on another continent, the young Art Spiegelman applied to the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and passed the exam. His parents, Vladek and Anja Spiegelman, were two Jews from Poland who survived through the Nazi ghetto of Sosnowiec and the extermination camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau. , a massive graphic novel, thirteen years in the making, depicts the complicated relationship between Art and his father, the very process of creating , and, in an interlocked way, Vladek s experience, living in Poland during the rise and fall of the Third Reich.  In those days, Hollywood was producing some of its most celebrated films, and Mickey Mouse was quickly becoming the cutest little mascot on the silver screen. At that very same moment, the Allied troops carried movie cameras into the concentration camps. The films that remain from that time  the ones shown during the Nuremberg trial   are tough to watch, haunting, almost impossible to put into words. Art Spiegelman has managed to blend both pictures (Disney and the Red Army file footage) poetically, through flat, condensed and straightforward drawings. His old father, a bit soft in the head and speaking in a funny broken English, provides a deeply personal, honest, at times slightly Kafkaesque or Chaplinesque account of these dreadful years, of that constant fear and deprivation, such that we could make some sense of this inhuman, world-changing experience.  There s a quote by somewhere in this book:  Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness . This visual masterpiece is a refutation of this sentence. And it has left me both moved and dumbfounded.  Watched Roman Polanski 's film , based on Wladyslaw Szpilman s harrowing experience, during the war, in the Warsaw Ghetto. Both and Polanski s movie share this sense of gradually rising horror and convey the same utter stupefaction.  2 book reviews: Wonderful example of the power of a graphic novel!   This is the  Complete  edition of  Maus: A Survivor s Tale  collecting both parts:  My Father Bleeds History  and  And Here My Troubles Began .       While it took long time of finally reading ,...  ...I knew that it was a graphic novel referring about the Jew Holocaust, but using mice (Jews) and cats (Nazis) as the characters,...  ...and even while I was sure that it will be a crude telling, I didn t expect that the only difference between  reality  and this graphic novel would be the choice of using  animals  as the characters in the story.  I mean, while I agree that Jew Holocaust isn t a humorous matter, I supposed that it would be some  imaginative  use of places, tools, terms, etc  taking in account that the story was full of mice, cats and even pigs (with some frog or dog, here and there).  Actually, I don t know why using  animals  as characters if everything else in the story will be keep as it happened. Even there are some odd moments of a  female mouse person  scared due the presence of regular rats.  Again, the Jew Holocaust is not a matter to take in comical way, but then, I think that the graphic novel could plainly use human beings (not necessarily too realistic, some cartoon style could work) and the graphic novel will be the same as good, the same as relevant.  You know, as in the movie where the horrors of the Holocaust are there, but still there is space for some humorous moments, that they help as tension relief without meaning any disrespect to the tragic historic event.  However, definitely the graphic format of this story makes possible for readers to be witness from the begining until the end (and even further) of the whole tragic and cruel process of what Jews endured (and not many were able to get out alive from it) during the World War II.  A titanic graphic story constructed during years of artistic effort to show, with detail and authenticity, one of the darkest episodes of human history.       The success of obviously can tied to the reason of being a Jew Holocaust s story, and almost any suc story receive a wide positive acceptance, but I think that what makes different from many of similar stories is its bold honesty.  Here, you won t have a partial view of the tragic event or spotless characters.  Obviously Nazis and Polish collaborators/sympathizers are shown doing their evil stuff, also you will watch how Jews behaved with their own, robbing food from their fellow people, not doing any favor unless get paid with something (gold, food, cigarrettes, etc ), true, it was an extreme situation, but usually movies and other books don t hesitate to show Nazi s inhuman actions, but you have to realize that those were prisons, and life in prisons is tough and people will lose any humanity from them in the urge to survive.  Also, Art Spiegelman, the author, was bold showing how hard was to live with his father, Vladek Spielgelman (the main character in the Holocaust parts), Vladek wasn t a saint (and after all, how many of us really is?) with not only crazy habits but even racist thinking against afro-american people. Art Spiegelman is a character in the story too, and while he is a whole better as person than his father, he doesn t portrait himself as a saint and you can appreciate how even at some moments, he does some kinda unfair actions, since after all, he is human too. His family is as disfunctional as others, being Holocaust s survivors didn t turn it magically into  Norman Rockwell paintings .  Anybody can create perfect heroes, only true writers are able to show the dark moments of his/her own family, in the middle of the storytelling of a book.  In this way, with boldness and courage, exposes us with a harsh truth: Survivors from a war aren t necessarily good people, saved by their faith or spared due the purity of their souls. No. Survivors from a war (in most cases) is just because plain luck. Even some survivors got such bad luck of dying after the war ended and by non-military personnel.  War is a crazy thing (any war) and if you try to get some logic out of it,...  ...you will end as crazy as it.    3 book reviews: MAI PI  JAMAIS PLUS NEVER AGAIN    Un bellissimo fumetto? Uno splendido romanzo? E perch  non un ottimo film? (In fondo le dimensioni delle vignette di Spiegelman fanno davvero venire in mente i fotogrammi di un film 35 mm).    I nazisti descrivevano gli ebrei come immondi parassiti, portatori di peste e corruzione, che invadono l Europa (qualcuno adesso prova a usare la stessa immagine per chi arriva d oltremare): Spiegelman disegna gli ebrei come topi, i nazisti come gatti, i polacchi come maiali. Animali parlanti per esprimere condizioni umane profonde difficili da esprimere altrimenti (Esopo, Fedro, La Fontaine). E perch  no, anche il Mickey Mouse disneyano.  Spiegelman figlio intervista Spiegelman padre sulla Shoah (la madre   morta suicida, il fratello maggiore   morto avvelenato dalla zia, anche lei suicida, per evitargli l orrore del campo di sterminio). Il racconto del padre   storia nota e stranota? A me sembra di sentirla per la prima volta, l'approccio di Spiegelman   unico e irripetibile.    Una storia straziante? S , ma anche tanto tenera, romantica.  Uomini topi pi  umani degli umani. In ogni caso,   una storia che bisogna continuare a raccontare, che non bisogna dimenticare.  Che sorpresa la parte moderna, che regalo. Un rapporto padre e figlio che nella sua peculiarit    tuttavia paradigmatico.  A Spiegelman   stato chiesto se non gli sembrava di cattivo gusto mettere in fumetti la tragedia dell Olocausto. La sua risposta   stata: Di cattivo gusto   Auschwitz.   4 book reviews: A way to deal with the unspeakable that makes it even more disturbing and weird.  Maus I: A Survivor 's Tale: My Father Bleeds History  Using animals for certain nations is a balancing act It s still a great work, but maybe all the same animals of one species would have been an even better choice. Not just because it would have been ideal to show that they re all the same, just different, let 's say with dogs or cats and many breeds, but because it s just an unnecessary point of criticism that could have easily been avoided. It 's petty and art is free, but some nations might not find it that great to be associated with certain animals.  Definitively nothing for kids or even some adults It s just too hardcore, by using anthropomorphized animals and the art of painting, it gets even worse and kind of more graphic. But the impact and mind blowing factor are amazing, because it s  Much more memorable that way than in general anti war productions Because people are used to war movies, games, satires, pictures, etc., which creates a kind of habituation effect and deadening, but this is something different and more tangible. Each page screams out the terror, the underlying themes are the sickest possible for even the most murderous apes on the planet, and one will never forget the associations between the pictures and reality itself.  It could be used for visualizing other atrocities too There have been other genocides in colonial history without numbers of the people killed, starved to death, or infected with plagues and no real interest in redemption by giving back land to Native Americans of both Americas or historical revisionism. Let s say removing statues and street names of mass murderers in the US, just imagine this in Germany with nazi leaders and the swastika instead of slave trading warmongerers and the confederate flag. Impossible and unthinkable in Europe after WW2, but in the bible belt, it s totally fine more than 150 years after the American civil war. Even more disturbing is the 20th century history of Russia and China with numbers between dozens of millions up to 100 million people killed per country. Especially adapted to one country and its history, the Maus concept would have immense potential for opening minds and maybe even something like redemption and a real reappraisal of history besides political correct drivel, bigotry, and empty promises. The crazy and disturbing thing is that it would mean imprisonment or even death for the artists creating such works in many countries that are still developing or already full scale dictatorships, with advanced surveillance technologies making the police states seem too perfectly developed to ever fall. Because resistance and rebellion have become impossible.    Total escalation towards genocide and holocaust  And some of the most disturbing depictions of it People tend to be shocked, avoid such topics, or pretend that such things can t happen again, but nothing shows better how dangerous and mad the human animal is than the ultimate consequence of hate, generated because of greed and megalomania. Especially regarding how it happened, could have happened elsewhere, and has the potential to happen again during and after global catastrophes, political crises, or future world wars.  It won the Pulitzer Prize for very good reasons Like many great graphic novel masterpieces with important messages, it has some postmodernist elements even questioning the seemingly positive elements, besides the detailed descriptions of atrocities. That s especially exemplified by  The reaction of the other animals Just as in real history, there have been actions and politics before, during, and after the war that had big influences on what happened. To just blame the Germans would be far too superficial, one has to look at the fascist tendencies in many other countries that could have easily led to Man in the High Castle scenarios without WW2.  Who financed it and wrote the propaganda pamphlet. Again, not just the Krauts. Both are not wanted questions that will still take much time to be answered, because no company, government, or religion wants to have anything to do with mass murder and war. But today, with big history and more and more facts coming up, it s quite clear to see who gave money, not just to the Nazi party, but to all the varieties of it in the UK, US, France, etc. It s just that nobody talks about that, just as slavery and colonialism tend to be avoided as unwanted elephants in the room, no matter how omnipresent their consequences are. So the biggest bigotry lies in the fact that  Until today there has been no real analysis of how big the impact of those forces in other countries and institutions was and is For instance the different US approach, just as with its own American Civil War, making it impossible to ever heal these wounds decades and centuries after wars happened. As long as there is no questioning, revision, and especially prevention against what happened in conglomerates, governments, and the Vatican, it 's just a question of when history will repeat itself. The fact that just mentioning companies, the church, and the politics of other countries still trigger many people to shoot the messenger, to not get their country or faith contaminated with the blood of millions, is disturbing too.  The authors' intention to include himself and his father This one isn t as essential as the terrifying big story itself. It could have easily been a full autobiography without Spiegelman and his complicated relationship with his father, but this personal, subjective note maybe gives it some extra identification points and makes it somehow even more memorable. Because it shows the possibility that it could have happened to everyone better than with fictional characters.  Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:  5 book reviews: Spiegelman winning a Pulitzer Prize (and Guggenheim Fellowship) for this work, was a first for a graphic novel. Spiegelman captures the story of his Polish Jewish father 's life before and after the second world war, but it could be said as importantly gives episodic accounts about his relationship with his father as he recorded his history; and as a result gave examples of the reality of how the horrors of occupied Europe and Auschwitz not only impacted on the survivors, but also their children 's lives. A powerful book, made strangely with more impact because all the Jews are portrayed as mice, the Germans' cats, Poles' pigs, Americans' as dogs etc. 9 out of 12.   6 book reviews: Art Spiegelman is smiling today, after a Tennessee school district banned one of the greatest books of all time (that happens to be a two-volume graphic novel) supposedly because of \"inappropriate language\" (swearing?! Heaven forfend! They do not swear in Tennessee, bless the gods; certainly children there must not use these vulgar phrases that exist in millions of other books and on the playground, let 's be real) and. . . wait for it the presence of nudity--a naked woman--but get this, all the characters are animals in this Holocaust tragedy. The offending naked \"woman\" is actually a mouse!!--bless their hearts for protecting their children from animal porn!  Oh, and why is Art smiling? Because sales of his banned book are now soaring, of course. Of course! Read banned books! Or maybe I should say: Ban Books! so everyone would read them.  What is this really about? I am not sure, but I think it is connected to the banning of \"critical race theory\" which really means we do not want to upset children by telling them the truth about racist or anti-semitic history.  And trust me, there is no a wave of book banning happening in my country, not just Maus.  Read banned books. Time for me to reread and finally review why it is a masterpiece.  NY Times article on the banning (or shall I call it canceling?):   7 book reviews:  Yes, life always takes the side of life, and somehow the victims are blamed. But it wasn t the best people who survived, nor did the best ones die. It was random!   Whether you ve read it or not, I m sure you ve heard of Art Spiegelman 's Maus. First and foremost, in 1992, Maus became the first graphic novel to ever win a Pulitzer Prize (the Special Award in Letters). Decades later, in 2022, Maus is still in the news, because a school in Tennessee removed the book from its curriculum, deeming it  inappropriate  on account of language and nudity. When a book is controversial/banned, I tend to want to read it more. I hope there are more like me out there (including those kids who are being deprived of the opportunity to learn about it in school! It 's the true story of a Jewish man who survived the Holocaust in wartime Europe. This is history. It happened!)  In his brilliantly crafted graphic novel, the author tells the story of his Polish-Jewish parents, Vladek and Anja Spiegelman, both of whom were Holocaust survivors, having been imprisoned in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The narrative moves back and forth between his parents  experiences in wartime Europe and his present-day relationship with the aging Vladek. The narrative of The Complete Maus: A Survivor 's Tale is divided into two books: Book 1 (originally published in 1986) , covers the period preceding Vladek and Anja s imprisonment and follows their story from the time they met, married, and started a family ( Art s older brother, Richieu, one of the dedicatees of this book, did not survive the War) to the Nazi occupation and the persecution of Jews. What starts with restrictions, curfews, rationing, and seizure of businesses and personal property, intensifies as Jews are displaced, deported, imprisoned and much worse. Book 1 also includes a short strip titled Prisoner on the Hell Planet (originally written in 1972) in which the author depicts events leading up to his mother 's suicide in 1968. Book#2 (published in 1991), , follows Vladek s experiences in the concentration and work camps. Though he was separated from his wife in the camps, they managed to communicate with one another. Both of them survived, were liberated separately and were eventually reunited. We also continue to follow the author and his father in the present day.  is a compelling work of non-fiction. Not only does the author share his father 's story, detailing the atrocities faced by his Jewish parents and their families during the Holocaust, but he also talks about the challenges he faced in the process of framing this book - having to coax his father to share his stories, his self-doubt and other obstacles he faced in his creative process and how the stories and publication of the first book affected him personally (The first segment was published in 1986, the second was printed in 1991). The author is brutally honest in how he portrays his own guilt over his inability to truly comprehend what his parents went through and voices his concern over whether his choice of medium/format would be justified. The author combines his brilliantly conceptualized artwork and masterful storytelling to share a part of his family s story in a unique format. The graphic novel format employs anthropomorphic representation of Germans as cats, Jews as mice, ethnic Poles as pigs and Americans as dogs. Spiegelman does inject a good dose of humor in his present-day narrative. While his aging father s miserliness , distrust and stubbornness do make for a few lighter moments in this harrowing tale, it is also not too hard to see how the trauma of the past casts a shadow on his present life. This is a heartbreaking story, told in a unique way, which does not make it any less real or any less hard-hitting. I spent hours reading and rereading parts of the book while also admiring the artwork.  Overall, this is an incredible book that is a must-read for those who are interested in reading about WWII and the Holocaust. Even if you don t usually read graphic novels, I would still suggest picking this one up. You won t be disappointed.  8 book reviews: It didn t dawn on me until later that this brilliant piece of graphic artistry and fiction is actually a very clever allegory. On the face of it, we re led to believe that it s a story of the terrible suffering perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jews in Poland and throughout Europe. But if you scratch beneath the surface, I think you ll find that this particular holocaust story was made to symbolize something more pervasive and endemic. I speak of the horrific violence that persists to this day; that inflicted by cats on defenseless mice. Perhaps the most obvious clue that this is, in truth, the intended theme lies in the title itself: . For those of you unfamiliar with German, this is their word for mouse. Beyond that, when you look carefully at the drawings, you see that the goose-steppers have distinctly feline features, while the persecuted Jews in the ghettos and camps have rodent-like proboscides and disproportionately small eyes.  Cat on mouse violence is so old and pervasive that, in a way, we ve become desensitized to it. Countless depictions of it in the arts have made it a stale, clich d topic; almost cartoonish at times. That s why I thought it was particularly effective to tell the story allegorically. When seen through the lens of the Jewish experience, and with Spiegelman s masterstroke of personalizing the story by laying bare the difficult relationship he had with his father (the survivor), the residuum of cat brutality that can literally tear mice families apart is brought home to us in a very different way.  Original: Mar 9, 2012  ------------------------  Addendum: Aug 23, 2013  This still ranks as my top graphic novel of all time, but I just finished Chris Ware 's which gives it a pretty good run for the money. The suffering in that one may not be as extreme, but it 's every bit as real.  9 book reviews: Spiegelman consigue con este comic dar con una forma distinta de interesarnos una vez m s en las atrocidades del holocausto, lo que tiene su m rito pues todo lo contado en Maus lo hemos le do y/o visto muchas veces. Es por ello que durante su lectura acudir n a sus mentes historias de otras novelas, escenas de otras pel culas.  En mi caso, la novela que aparec a a menudo en mi cabeza era  Sin destino , de Imre Kert sz, empezando por el tono fr o y distante que comparten ambas historias, doblemente subrayado en el comic al estar los personajes caracterizados por animales  ratones para los jud os, gatos para los alemanes, cerdos para los polacos, perros para los norteamericanos , una frialdad que se aten a considerablemente en los momentos en los que se trata de la relaci n que el dibujante manten a con su padre, protagonista y fuente de informaci n, o cuando cuestiona su propio trabajo, estando en ambas situaciones muy presente el sentimiento de culpa, por la distancia que siempre estableci  el autor con su padre, por un lado, y por el sentimiento de estar haciendo negocio con el dolor de los jud os, por el otro.  Tambi n el sentimiento de culpa es fundamental en la novela de Kert sz, aunque en este caso lo fuera por lo com n que era en muchos de los que sobrevivieron, y cuya causa Primo Levi resumi  en esta demoledora frase:  Sobreviv an los peores, es decir, los m s aptos; los mejores han muerto todos .  Por el contrario, en el comic se remarca mucho m s el papel que tuvo la suerte en esa salvaci n, la infinidad de hechos afortunados que se tuvieron que producir en cada caso para salir con vida de aquel horror, junto a las habilidades, la malicia, la fortaleza, el instinto y la inteligencia necesaria para aprovecharlos. Y as , la frase de Levi se transforma radicalmente en Spiegelman:  no sobrevivieron los mejores, ni murieron los mejores.  Fue el azar! .  Una frase que es un intento por respetar la memoria de las v ctimas, de las que sobrevivieron, de las que no se suicidaron despu s de la guerra, como hizo la propia madre de Spiegelman, pero tambi n una forma de ayudar a sus descendientes (la frase aparece en el comic en la boca del terapeuta de Spiegelman). En cualquier caso, el autor, como tambi n hiciera Kert sz en su novela, no evita responsabilizar a los jud os por todo aquello que hicieron y que no hicieron por evitar su exterminio, por el precio que ten a todo acto de ayuda prestada, y no solo por parte de alemanes o polacos, sino tambi n por parte de los propios jud os, y como aquellos que ten an con qu  pagar y/o menos escr pulos tuvieron m s posibilidades de salvarse.  Sobre el comic en s  no puedo decir mucho, no soy un consumidor habitual de este formato, el resultado es oscuro, todo  l en blanco y negro, como todo el testimonio gr fico que de aquello se tiene, el trazo, basto y, sin embargo, eficaz, los personajes apenas muestras rasgos que los distingan a unos de otros. La estructura del relato es compleja y juega a varios niveles, existen muchos elementos metaf ricos, algunos evidentes como la identificaci n de las nacionalidades con distintos animales o que los jud os, vengan de donde vengan, sean siempre ratones o los cruces de caminos con forma de esv stica  otros son m s sutiles.  En fin, un gran trabajo que merece sin duda el premio Pulitzer que recibi .  10 book reviews: One of the most influential literary works ever...in or out of comics. The fact that there have been calls to ban this book is truly beyond compression: when you look at all the negative influences that our children are exposed to every day - and some people are focused on this book? Ca not help but believe Goebbels would be happy to join their group! 11 book reviews: LOVE 12 book reviews: Maus was more than I expected. I knew it would be about World War II and the Holocaust with the charaters being anthropomorphic mice, cats, pigs, dogs, etc. What I did not realize was it would expand even farther in to the specific lives of the Spiegelmans before, during, and after the war.    Throughout the book the artist/author is a featured character struggling with his curmudgeonly father while he tries to document the story of his father 's time in 1930s and 40s Poland and Germany. His experiences with his father are as much a part of the book as the stories he is trying to document.    Another viewpoint of life under Nazi oppression is always riviting. I have read and seen both fiction and non-fiction accounts of life during WWII. I have been to the Dachau concentration camp. These stories are important, but are not always easy to read or tell. I applaud Spiegelman for this creative approach that hopefully brings these stories to those who might not be inclined to read a big novel or watch a documentary.    Basically everyone should read this or at least some stories of the war. They say those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.  13 book reviews: Such a creative and innovative way to write a memoir. Loved the animal metaphor with mice and cats but evermore I adored the writer 's honesty about his father 's personality and its effects on his mental health. Even though his father was a Holocaust survivor, even before such trauma it is very likely he had what we call personality disorder, and the graphic novel does the raw unpacking of emotional pressure that Spiegelman grew up with having the kind a father he had; rigid, adamant, neurotic, demanding, stingy, always deeply unsatisfied. Spiegelman has a clear distinction of what is an aftermath of the trauma and what were his father 's personality traits even before tragic events. The reflection on his relationship with his father and the way it affected him in later life I find as being as valuable part of the story as the recollection of his father 's memories of the Holocaust. The world is not black and white and victims in one situation can be the same people that deeply hurt others. This graphic novel shows the transgenerational suffering, of both Arts parents and him as their child, dealing with his mother 's mental illness and his father 's personality being even more distorted as a consequence of trauma. I applaud Art for his courage to speak about these sensitive subjects and hope that writing his father 's memoir with autobiographical elements had a cathartic effect for him.  14 book reviews: Until just a few weeks ago, the only reason for why I read graphic novels now and then was because of people 's constant recommendations about the beauty and the value of those kinds of books. I will be honest; I am guilty of never believing those words. Most likely did I read graphic novels which did not suit my personal tastes, but Art Spiegelman was capable of shattering my expectations and completely stunning me with the art of his writing and his illustrations.  But let 's start at the beginning. is a collection of two graphic novels with autobiographical background about the author, Art Spiegelman, and his father 's recollections about his experiences in the Second World War. Spiegelman constantly switches between present and past, between the time when he writes down what his father tells him and the time when all the horrible events in the concentration camps took place. But he does not only include information about his father Vladek Spiegelman 's tale of survival; the personal and very conflicted relationship between Art and Vladek also turns out to be a central part of the story, including controversy about Vladek 's second wife and Art 's personal approach to the success he had as an author when the first installment in his series of graphic novels was published.  Obviously, memoirs or autobiographies always include potential to let their author shine in a bright light, to let them appear heroic and exemplary. You have to rely on what the author tells you about himself and the people surrounding him, on which layers of his own character he presents. Art Spiegelman did so in a very convincing way, pointing out not only the horrible crimes which were committed during the Nazi period, but also the flaws he and his father had themselves, as human beings with all their faults and mistakes. Art and his father appear in such a realistic way that you ca not help but care for them; something which never happened to me before in a book with autobiographical content. Of course, some parts of the novels were shocking, which you need to expect before reading something about such an important subject. Feelings of despair and fear overshadowed Vladek Spiegelman 's recollections of his experiences during the Second World War, from his family 's decline and his marriage to his transport to Auschwitz.  Perhaps the most memorable thing about those graphic novels is the way Art Spiegelman used animal heads in the place of recognizable human ones. The completely black-and-white illustrations vividly underline the feelings Spiegelman wanted to express with his books. And still now, almost two months after finishing them, am I stunned.  Do I need to mention that I would recommend these graphic novels to everyone?  15 book reviews: \"There 's only one kind of people who would vote to ban Maus, whatever they are calling themselves these days.\" - Neil Gaiman.  \"I do not care for these new Nazis, and you may quote me on that!\" - John Mulaney  Fucking Hell.  --  This is not an easy graphic novel to read. The illustrations are beautiful, but the simple black and white style reminds the reader that the subject matter is one of the darkest periods of modern history. This very personal glimpse into the horrors of the Holocaust touch on many complex emotions: loyalty, fear, survivor s guilt, anger   Art Spiegelman s father Vladek is a Holocaust survivor, who grew up and lived in Poland, was drafted into the Polish army, lived in a P.O.W. camp, the Jewish ghettos, was eventually sent to Auschwitz and saw countless family members and friends die before the end of the war and his eventual relocation in America. The graphic novel tells the story of Art getting his father to open up about his life and tell him what he went through, as he himself tries to understand why he struggles to connect with Vladek.  I hadn t expected that roughly half of this book is actually about Art coming to terms with what his parents endured, with his issues making art about the Holocaust and making money (not to mention getting famous) off this work he feels incredibly uneasy about. There was a history of depression and possible mental illness in his family (you learn early on that this mother was depressive and committed suicide) that their history probably amplified. He uses an interesting meta approach to discuss this, illustrating conversations with his wife and therapist, to illustrate that the experience of creating this graphic novel was a struggle on many different levels. This harrowing portrait of the multi-generational consequences of war is probably what gutted me most as I read this: even long after the bombs stopped dropping, damage continues to be inflicted on people who weren t even born during the war because of the unimaginable reality their parents had to survive.  This book has historical significance both from its subject, but also because it was one of the first graphic novels that got serious academic interest, and the first to ever win a Pulitzer Prize: the medium had often been dismissed as comic strips before, but Spiegelman s use of metaphor and the very intimate story he chose to tell showed that graphic novels were not limited to Superman and Archie stories. This makes  Maus  an important and seminal work that s worth a read if only on that basis (and yes, I am aware that underground comics had touched non-traditional topics before and used a post-modernist approach, but I am strictly talking about more mainstream publications).  The representations of different groups of people as different animals bothered me at first, because it felt like an easy generalization. But I read an interview with Spiegelman where he discusses where the idea comes from (old German propaganda films that depicted Jews as vermin, for instance) and also that he wanted to underline the absurdity of dividing people by assuming that each ethnicity has a uniform look or set of physical traits that defines them as human beings. I get the point he is trying to make: the anthropomorphic animals also make the incredibly difficult subject a little easier to absorb. I m not sure I could have read the whole book in a couple of sittings had the drawings been more realistic.  Imperfect but highly recommended.  16 book reviews: Una tr gica historia de supervivencia que arroja una nueva luz a un periodo tan oscuro.  El concepto de Maus es confuso al principio.  Qui n es Art?  Por qu  los personajes son ratones, ranas, cerdos y gatos? Es con las p ginas que comienzas a comprender la incre ble met fora que se ha montado el autor, y sobre todo, la manera tan inteligente de contar esta historia a trav s de duna doble narraci n.  Nunca hab a le do una novela gr fica y me ha gustado mucho la experiencia. Es interesante ver en las propias p ginas el proceso de creaci n de estas mismas, descubriendo no solo el pasado del padre de Art, sino la vida del propio Art y lo que le cost  dibujar y guionizar toda la obra. hablando de culpabilidad por vivir en la  poca post-Holocausto con tantas facilidades, sobre familia y relaciones personales, sobre dinero, sobre inspiraci n... Son peque os detalles que otorgan a la obra de un valor mucho mayor.  Lo que es en s  la historia de Vladek, el padre de Art, me ha dejado Conocemos muchas historias del Holocausto, pero ya os digo que ninguna como esta...

Without their well publicized unanimous vote to ban Art Spiegelman s Pulitzer Prize winning accounting of the Holocaust who knows what mischievous and vacuous activities would have otherwise occupied my time. So here s to you, you bible-belted brownshirts of the volunteer state, carry on and sieg heil  19 book reviews: #Maus You will find in the media a county in my home state of TN has decided to ban the curriculum of this graphic novel from their school on International Holocaust Remembrance Day Jan 27, 2022. I read this a couple years ago, but still recall the nature of the book as a brilliant depiction of the Holocaust. Some people would say that part of history is too disturbing and should never be taught, as well as slavery to be hidden away and forgotten. If we decide to ban the truth, then we are no better than the people who killed 6 million Jews. It is vital to teach the past so we can learn from it and make sure it is not repeated. The author, Art Spiegelman, was brilliant to capture this horrific event in a graphic novel. It is hard to imagine the survival of his father, Vladek Spiegelman, as a Jew in the concentration camp Auschwitz. He was one of the few survivors that lived to tell his story how he worked at the gas chambers to help the Nazis eradicate the Jews. His survival would haunt him forever after hearing the screams of men, women, and children in these chambers and later transported to be burned. No... it is not easy to accept, but vital to keep his story alive so this generation will learn the truth from survivors. The graphic novel depicts the Jews as mice, the German Nazis as cats and the Americans as Dogs that eliminate the Nazis Regime. The story was told to reveal the disturbing events of history, so students can understand it.  America, Please Recall that The Empty Library in Germany is a symbol of the Nazis book burning in 1933.  20 book reviews: 5/5   Le do en enero de 2023.  No suelo leer muchas novelas sobre el nazismo y la vida en los campos de concentraci n alemanes. Considero que las tramas son repetitivas, ya que una ingente parte de lo escrito gravita sobre los aspectos m s escabrosos y m rbidos, cuando no sobre el dramatismo, lo que no es dif cil teniendo en cuenta las condiciones a las que fueron sometidos los prisioneros y, muy en particular, los jud os. Adem s, mi visita reciente al campo de concentraci n de Terezin ha exacerbado y horrorizado mis sentidos, al comprobar c mo todo esto que tanto hemos le do y visto en documentales y pel culas, pudo existir realmente en toda su crudeza. As  las cosas, intento seleccionar mucho las obras que leo de esta tem tica de un tiempo a esta parte.  Por otra parte, tampoco soy lector habitual de obras en c mic, m s all  de alguna historieta gr fica de cuando en cuando, que ni siquiera rese o por estos lares.  Dicho esto, quedan claras las pocas posibilidades que esta obra ten a de que yo la abordara. Sin embargo, la insistencia de varios buenos amigos lectores, as  como la constataci n de ser la  nica obra de este g nero que, hasta la fecha, ha recibido el premio Pulitzer, concretamente en 1992, termin  por despertar mi curiosidad.  Y debo decir que ha sido un acierto completo, por cuanto he disfrutado mucho leyendo esta obra y, adem s, el estilo c mic hace que se lea con avidez y presteza, manteniendo un estilo tenebroso y oscuro, pero poco propenso al efectismo f cil y a las descripciones crueles intensas.  Por qu  el autor elige ratones para presentar a los jud os?; tal vez la siguiente cita nos puede dar una pista:  (Art culo de peri dico, Pomerania, Alemania, mediados de la d cada de 1930).  Como encontramos en la solapa del libro, la novela es .  Y esto lo hace usando una forma de tremendamente original y contando la historia de un modo tranquilo y sosegado. En efecto, en la obra, es el padre del protagonista (que es el autor de la novela) quien va contando a su hijo, a lo largo de sus visitas, la historia de sus vicisitudes vitales desde 1932 hasta 1945, intercalando retazos de su vida actual, donde pueden apreciarse las consecuencias de las penalidades sufridas. Aparte de sucesos dram ticos por supuesto, cabe tambi n destacar la descripci n de c mo los prisioneros trapicheaban con la escasez para conseguir sobrevivir.  Por todo ello, mi calificaci n no puede ser otra que 5 estrellas, junto con la recomendaci n de que la le is, y as  contribuir a que el conocimiento de lo sucedido logre evitar que vuelva a producirse.  (Adolf Hitler)  21 book reviews: My very first graphic novel - and one of the highest calibre. What can I say about it that has not been said before? It is devastating, personal, complex, overwhelming. Timely, too, given what is happening in the Ukraine. Such a poignant and important reminder of where we have been, and where we can go, and god, please, let 's not go there again. 22 book reviews: Rese ar Maus supone una de las experiencias m s gratificantes de mi vida porque es el segundo libro en 2015 al que le doy la nota m xima. Pues ver n, desde hace muchos a os siempre he sentido profunda fascinaci n por los temas hist ricos y sobre todo en torno a la segunda guerra mundial. Es un tema recurrente en mis lecturas y siempre me gusta aprender cosas nuevas sobre esta  poca terrible de la humanidad. As  que cuando conoc  esta obra sab a que deb a leerla en alg n punto de mi vida y gracias a la biblioteca de la universidad he podido hacerlo.

I am not a fan of history and so I avoided it for the longest time possible. A book I was reading did mention that it was a graphic novel about Jew people and what they went through and I became interested and found myself a copy!    I like what the author did, he is very smart, Jew people are the mice and the Germans are the cats and this is a sneaky way to reduce tension! The author tells us what happened IRL through his father and the book is divided into 2 parts. I loved how the author stayed genuine and showed us positives and negatives and he was not biased! I think this rawness and honesty added a lot to the story.    The graphics were not the best and there was much dialogue and it was a bit crammed and a bit hard to read! But at the end of the say, I learned from this book more than years in school did to me!

En MAUS conoc  a un chico interesado en contar la vida de sus padres durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Una narrativa que tal vez hemos le do mucho, pero de la que jam s dejaremos de aprender.  Las emociones del hijo y la empat a con los pap s me hizo llorar en muchas ocasiones.  La estructura narrativa es demasiado buena. Y el hecho de que sea en formato c mic, permite que podamos visualizar mejor las descripciones de los sobrevivientes.  Me inspira mucho que el autor no haya  querido dar un mensaje  con este libro, si no simplemente retratar la persecuci n jud a.   En alg n punto lo sabremos todo sobre este hecho hist rico?  25 book reviews:  The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human.  - Adolf Hitler  This a graphic novel told from two timelines. In the narrative present, Art Spiegelman (author) is interviewing his father Vladek about his experiences as a Polish Jew and a Holocaust survivor. The narrative past depicts these very experiences from the mid 1930s to the end of the Holocaust in 1945. Spiegelman has utilised different species of animals to portray different nationalities and races - Jews as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs and French as frogs.  I was actually inspired to read this after visiting a war museum with my friend. Though I had a lot of fun that day, the Holocaust Exhibition was one of the most harrowing and tragic things I have ever seen. During the exhibition, I realised how ignorant I had been to the extent of brutality, inhumanity and pain that was inflicted on Jews during WW2.    Maus is an incredible tale that has so much to give to its reader. It was both insightful and addictive with its illustrations and style of storytelling. It allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of how the camps were run and what it was like for the prisoners. I am so glad that this is how Mr. Spiegelman chose to write his father s story and the story of those who didn t live to tell it.  (from the gas chambers)  26 book reviews: I feel like anything I could say about this book is going to sound woefully inadequate, but I guess I will give it a shot anyway. Maus had obviously been on my radar for ages as a critical piece of Holocaust literature as well as being the only graphic novel to ever win the Pulitzer Prize, so I was certainly expecting it to be good, but I do not think anything could have prepared me for how utterly harrowing of a read this ended up being. And again, yes, I did know that its subject matter was the Holocaust, but I also knew that Spiegelman made the famous stylistic decision to depict Jews as mice and Nazis as cats in this book, so I guess I was expecting something altogether more abstract? Instead it 's a rather literal depiction of Spiegelman 's father 's experiences throughout WWII, culminating in his release from Auschwitz in 1945.  There 's also an added dimension where Spiegelman chooses to depict the scenes in which he interviewed his father and came to hear these stories. In this present-day timeline we learn about Spiegelman 's complex relationship with his father, and all the tension and resentment that 's built up between them through the years, often due to the fact that his father 's life was shaped so significantly by this atrocious thing that Spiegelman struggles to make sense of, as he was born after the end of the war. Spiegelman also lost his mother to suicide decades earlier, a tragic event from which his father had never fully recovered, though he did go on to remarry. In one particularly devastating panel, Spiegelman laments to his wife that he wishes he could have been in Auschwitz with his parents so he could understand what they had to go through, so he could bridge that gap between generations. That 's this book in a nutshell: raw, unfiltered, uncompromising. It takes a strong stomach to get through this, and I think I spent the better part of it in tears, but if you are able to read this, I cannot recommend it highly enough. This is the best graphic novel I have read, the best piece of Holocaust literature that I have read, and strangely enough, the best love story that I have read. The final panel shattered me.  27 book reviews:  Show to me your pencil and I can explain you   such things. It s good to know exactly how was it just in case.     If you want to live, it s good to be friendly.     About Auschwitz, nobody can understand.  Like a lot of other people, I had heard of Maus but was not inspired to actually read it until school districts in the South started banning it from schools. Shame on them for such a despicable act, and a little bit of shame on me for never having read this book before.  The premise of is pretty simple. The author, Art Spiegelman, interviews his father, Vladek, a Polish Jew who survived WWII including spending its final months at Auschwitz. The story is told in black-and-white cartoons in which the Jews are mice, the Germans are cats, the Poles are pigs, and the Americans (when they finally arrive) are dogs. Vladek is an ordinary young man living an ordinary life, dating and then falling in love with Anja. They get married, he starts a business, they have a kid, she suffers from postpartum depression. But there are small hints of the gathering storm stories of Jews being disappeared, the first time he saw a Nazi flag and by the end of the second chapter, it s September of 1939, Vladek has been drafted into the Polish army, and little is ordinary anymore.  From there, and despite focusing on his father s personal story, tells a significant cross-section of the entire Holocaust from start to finish. The wholesale theft of Jewish property and businesses, the shortages and rationing, the papers and the roundups. Being moved by the Germans every few months, everything always a little worse. Building rooms with false walls, tiny bunkers to hide in each place they moved to. Needing help from others for survival but under the constant threat of betrayal from collaborators. Making impossible choices like  do we send our first-born son (Art s older brother, Richieu) away with friends, and risk never seeing him again, because we think it will increase his odds of survival,  and having to live with those choices. Hiding without food, hungry enough to just chew on wood to simulate the feel of eating, just barely surviving until, finally, being betrayed and taken to Auschwitz. How he managed to survive there until the end of the war, and how Vladek and Anja were finally reunited afterwards.  What I did not expect from was its B-story. There are sections at the beginning and end of each chapter in which we see Vladek in the present. Art has a tense, rather unhappy relationship with his father. Anja committed suicide in 1962, and it has haunted him and Art ever since. Vladek has remarried to a woman named Mala, but they are unhappy. We see the lasting effects of the Holocaust on the survivors and even their children. And because the book was originally published serially, there s even a bit of meta, as Art in the book talks about his guilt in telling this story at all, and his decision to present his father warts and all.  is an extraordinary story. It is both subtle and complicated. Despite the seeming simplicity of the drawing, there are scenes of evil not gore, not blood, but  that are difficult to look at. Rather than being banned by those who are cowards (or worse), should be read in every high school, not just for the history, but for its humanity, for its exercise in empathy towards family and/or people we don t understand. Truly a must read.  28 book reviews: [5.0 ]  :         es una novela gr fica que fue completada en 1991 por Art Spiegelman. Fue la primera novela gr fica en ganar un premio Pulitzer en 1992. La historia cuenta las experiencias del propio autor junto a las respectivas entrevistas que le hizo a su padre: este narra su vida como jud o polaco y superviviente del holocausto. En s , es un libro de memorias, hist rico, autobiogr fico y biogr fico, tiene una mezcla de g neros.

Est n en Estados Unidos ya que su madre y su padre lograron escaparse de la guerra. Esta parte se desarrolla espec ficamente en Rego Park (Nueva York), en donde Vladek Spiegelman, un jud o polaco que vivi  en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, le cuenta la historia a su hijo Art, que se encuentra creando un c mic. Adem s, est  presente esa ausencia maternal porque Anja (madre de Art y esposa de Vladek) se suicid  cuando Art ten a veinte a os. Vladek lleg  a destruir los diarios que ella escribi  sobre Auschwitz. La otra narraci n se compone de flash-backs de Vladek, en donde se narran sus vivencias antes y durante la guerra.  Por m s que se conozca, a grandes rasgos, las vivencias de los jud os en el Holocausto, es indiscutible que todas las narraciones son desgarradoras, crueles y horribles. No por tener una trama conocida por todos significa que ser  menos dolorosa la lectura; de hecho, todo lo contrario, uno se siente m s destrozado.  Esta es una historia tr gica, al igual que todas las de los jud os en aquellos a os, pero que, sin duda, te sacar  m s de una l grima. La t cnica del autor de intercalar el pasado con el presente es realmente majestuosa y digna de admiraci n, hasta se han creado diferentes corrientes de la novela gr fica a partir de esta obra (marc  un antes y un despu s en este g nero). Su t cnica de dibujo tiene un estilo muy minimalista y, tambi n, llega a ser muy innovadora en cuanto a las vi etas que crea y la estructura.  Es una obra maestra desde el inicio hasta el final ya que demuestra una originalidad innegable: el empleo de diversos animales para simbolizar los bandos (hasta llega a parecer una f bula por los comportamientos humanos que estas criaturas tienen), el uso de flash-backs y el recurso escogido (c mic). Hab a escuchado con anterioridad la majestuosidad de este relato y, por fin, me anim  a sumergirme en esta historia.    Finalmente, puedo decir que es un relato que dejar  a todos at nitos por su crudeza y originalidad. No he querido hablar con m s especificidad sobre la trama ya que todos nos hacemos una idea de lo que sucede. Considero que es una obra que merece ser le da por cualquier individuo porque les dejar  una gran marca en su coraz n.  29 book reviews: The Complete Maus Art Spiegelman  Graphic, intimate real-life testimony of the holocaust from a Polish survivor, and the trauma of the second-generation Holocaust survivors. (The children of the Holocaust survivor are known as second-generation survivors.) This second-generation have tried to make sense of their backgrounds, which are often obscured, especially where their parents have been unable to talk about their experiences.  Maus is really It jumps back and forth between the two stories, one set in the past (Poland), the other set in the present (NYC).  Vladek Spiegelman tells how he survived the holocaust as a Polish Jew. From the invasion to the spread of Naziam, to his time in Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp as a tin worker at the gas chambers. Vladek is one of the only surviving camp survivors who had intimate knowledge of how the gas chambers facilities worked because he worked there and lived to tell the tale. He saw how pesticide (Zyklon B) was dropped into the hollow columns to gas screaming victims and how they burned in crematoriums afterward. Most Jewish inmates who worked near the gas chambers and crematoriums were executed so they could not give testimony to the horrors they witnessed.  Art details his creative process of composing his book about his dad 's holocaust experiences. Art has a very antagonistic relationship with his father, Vledeck. We see Art trying to interview his reluctant father, pushing his father to recount his experiences. The holocaust permeates every detail of Spiegelman 's daily life, even though it took place so many years ago.  There is a need in our society to push the Holocaust into the past and keep it there, but we see throughout this novel that this is impossible. Survivors and their children do not have the luxury of just forgetting about it and moving on. You can stop talking about it, you can try to pretend it never happened, but the recollections of those horrible experiences never go away. You ca not erase them. They haunt their victims.  A predominant theme in the book is how traumatic events like the Holocaust continue to distort and shape people generations later, long after they are over. Children of Holocaust survivors are also affected by the holocaust, secondhand, through their parents. They often feel guilty about leading such pampered lives, compared to their parent 's horrific experiences. So, survivor s guilt stems from first-hand experience (holocaust survivors who feel guilty for surviving when so many loved ones did not) and it reverberates down through generations (children of holocaust survivors). Vledeck 's parenting style is warped by the long-term psychological effects the holocaust has on his behavior. In turn, Art 's childhood is warped by Vledeck s post-holocaust world view, a secondary repercussion of the Holocaust.   The graphics add power, context, and tone to the text, providing deeper insight into the mixed feelings and thoughts of the characters. You can hear (read) a character say one thing in the text, but you might also see them thinking/doing something very different, which is expressed in graphics.  Most of the text in the book are direct quotes from Art Spiegelman 's father, Vladik. Sometimes the graphics will reflect the same mood and message expressed in the text. Other times the graphics might reflect Art 's interpretation of what his dad is saying. This way the reader sees two very different interpretations of the same exact incident or story simultaneously. How brilliant is that?  Art Spiegelman also uses animals to represent different races and nationalities. It 's a very effective metaphor. Jews are drawn as mice, which reflects back to the anti-Semitic stereotype of Jews being subhuman rats. Germans are cats; they prey on Jewish mice. Americans are dogs, they fight the German cats. The French are frogs. The Polish are pigs; Nazis considered the Polish people to be pigs. Jewish Mice sometimes pretend to be Polish pigs to hide from the German Cats. They do this by wearing pigs masks.  While creating the book, Art struggles with how he should draw his French wife who converted to Judaism to please his father. It encourages the reader to think about the roles of race, ethnicity, nationality, and religion. Is Art 's wife a frog that transforms into a mouse? But she 's still French. So is she half frog, half mouse? Is she a frog in a mouse mask?   I understand that the holocaust can sometimes seem like a ghastly but impersonal genocide of countless, faceless victims. The magnitude and horror of it all can be so hard to stomach. But each of those six million people was an individual with their own personal story. Individual stories may not seem as important when compared to famous, historical figures like Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, but learning about each individual story is critical to understanding the magnitude of the Holocaust. Recorded memories are the only way Holocaust survivors can maintain a connection to the stolen lives of those who were erased from the face of the earth by the Holocaust.  ",
    " The Great Reset: Joe Biden and the Rise of Twenty-First-Century Fascism": "book reviews: So, I ve read most of this book twice AND I m still not ready to be done.  Reading  The Great Reset  is like assuming a doctoral thesis that s not quite right Some of the writing is so painfully bad it needed to be scratched and rewritten totally.  This continues on and on until at at about 47% on the Kindle version, Beck is struck by the realization that 21st century banking, medical, Fauci, supply and demand, housing, race, policing, and every other hot button from these last few years is coalescing into a giant single, 21st century umbrella of Fascism, when he adds the European characters into the information.  Stock Markets, International Markets, Paris Accord, Oil, Gas, OIL & GAS & O I L & G A S !!! COVID-19 driven by health care and saving lives?  It s no great reset, more an unveiling of the insidious left and what they ve been up to all this time   1 book reviews: Freedom is an unnatural state for humans. Very few humans in history have had the freedom to control their own lives. In every time and place, there are groups of people who think they can organize society better than before, that they know what s best for you, that they can run your life better than you can. This book examines the latest movements in this trend and pieces them together.  Key points:   Governments will use crises (Covid, global warming) to scare people into giving them more power. Actual solutions to such crises are ignored in favor of taking more power.   Modern Monetary Theory eliminates the need for fiscal responsibility.   ESG scores will control the behavior of individuals and corporations without resorting to gulags.   Media controlled by a few large groups in bed with government makes censorship easy.   Stakeholder capitalism puts government elites in charge of business decisions instead of customers.  Basically, the Great Reset is a plan for 21st-century fascism. It is pushed mostly by the World Economic Forum and tends to attract support by Progressives. It is a realization of the fears of Big Government (by the Right) and Big Corporations (by the Left) combined.  The book is largely nonpartisan other than the view that liberty is a great thing. It s a surprisingly quick read, organized into short sections with clear headings, and written in a casual, conversational style. More than 500 footnotes fill the last 80ish pages. The points are supported by direct quotes that are public record. Mr. Beck encourages readers to do their own research of the topic.  ====================================  Look, I get it. When I first heard about the Great Reset, it sounded like a poorly written movie plot some struggling thirtysomething in Los Angeles cooked up in his mom s basement between shifts at the Cheesecake Factory. But then I started to dig into the details about the Great Reset and what its most passionate supporters were saying, not just in private but publicly, on the record. And the more I learned, the more obvious it became that although the Great Reset is indeed a wile, crazy, completely out-there conspiracy theory, it is a very real one and it has the potential to dramatically alter our world forever.  The Great Reset will not necessarily require the mass imprisonment of dissenters, nationwide confiscation of businesses, or a bloody revolution. It can achieve authoritarian goals without jackbooted storm troopers or gulags, and it includes just enough elements of cronyism and payouts to global elites to make the system palatable to the world s wealthiest and most well-connected people. It is a kind of authoritarian, international, socialistic fascism, yes, but it s not Marx s socialism or the fascistic models embraced by Benito Mussolini. It is authoritarianism for our brand-new technology-rich, corrupt era. It is twenty-first century fascism.  Despite the media-contrived depictions to the contrary, nuclear is a lot better for the planet than wind or solar, which is especially important considering that the whole reason Americans are being urged to commit economic suicide with plans like the Green New Deal and Biden s Green New Deal-lite plan which would impose wind and solar energy on most of the country over just a couple of decades is that wind and solar facilities are so much greener than other forms of energy production. But nuclear facilities emit four times carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than do solar farms, and wind farms require four hundred times land than do nuclear power plants. ... Bulldozing millions of acres of land and killing millions of animals hardly sounds like green energy to me, but building these poor-performing monstrosities is just the beginning. After a few decades, when all the gigantic turbines and solar panels must be torn down, where do elites plan on putting them? I hate to break it to those of you who still think relying on wind and solar is a good idea, but you cannot just throw decommissioned wind and solar parts into a big blue recycling bin and leave it out on the street for your local garbageman to pick up. Wind turbines and solar panels create huge amounts of waste, much of it toxic, and no one has developed a clean, cost-effective way to deal with that gigantic problem. And remember, this is an issue that would come up every twenty or thirty years, as these facilities wear out.  Modern monetary theory might sound complicated, but it is actually very simple. According to MMT theorists, everyone should stop worrying so much about the national debt and deficits, because the U.S. government can print and spend as much money as it wants to in order to achieve the goals set by the federal government s bureaucratic masterminds and political elite. That s pretty much it.  It is also worth considering how digital currencies could be used to control economic behavior. If all currency were to become digitized and physical mediums of exchange were phased out, then banks, financial institutions, and governments would be able to track and control nearly every transaction in the world. Although there is no way of knowing exactly how they might try to use this unprecedented power, it is not hard to imagine how it could expand the authority of elites and impact regular folks on a daily basis. We have all heard about local governments  attempts to tax and in some cases ban certain unhealthy foods, everything from foods containing trans fats to sugary drinks. In a world with a centralized digital currency, what s to stop the ruling class from putting a limit on the number of Cokes you buy each week? Or the number of burgers you eat? Or the number of alcoholic beverages you consume or cigars you smoke? What s to stop elites from preventing you from buying alcohol, cigarettes, or Twinkies entirely? They bad for you, you know.  The Great Reset is a machine manufactured to usher in a new, highly sophisticated, technologically advanced, twenty-first century brand of international fascism, one with a corporate twist. But powerful machines like the Great Reset cannot operate without fuel. That is what modern monetary theory provides, by offering seemingly endless amounts of money that could be used to pay for just about anything government, corporations, and financial institutions can dream up.  Although you will not hear Great Resetters openly calling for authoritarianism, the Great Reset is clearly a new kind of soft authoritarianism that is not too far off from the merging of markets, corporatism, authoritarianism, collectivism, and modern technology that has been embraced by the Communist Party of China in recent decades. ... Openly calling for a takeover of the global economy by the ruling class would immediately alienate 90 percent of the general population, but by tying in the Green New Deal, a government jobs guarantee, and a host of other large social welfare programs, they have managed to win over some progressives and socialists who care deeply about those issues. And by painting the movement as a pro-business, pro-capitalism plan to improve the economy, they have managed to win over some establishment political figures on the right. But at its core, the Great Reset is not truly pro-socialism, and it s not pro-capitalism either it s just a rebranding of the same old tired ideas that elites have pushed a million times before:  Give us more power, and we promise we ll take care of you and fix the world s ills. Let us manage more of the economy, and we promise you ll all be wealthier for it. Give us the authority to punish the  bad guys  in society, and we ll save the planet from annihilation.   Stakeholder capitalism is an economic system in which companies are effectively required to put social justice causes and/or the goals of elites which, of course, vary wildly depending on the parties involved before profits, supply and demand, the desires of consumers, and other market forces that normally direct capitalist systems, which, don t forget, have created the most prosperous, healthy, safe societies humankind has ever known. ... Or put in much clearer terms, in a stakeholder capitalist system, companies should first serve the collective according to the demands of the ruling class in government, not their customers and owners. Stakeholder capitalism is just another way of saying  collectivist capitalism,  which really is not capitalism at all.  The consolidation of stock ownership in the hands of a small group of investment management companies is a relatively new and exceedingly dangerous development. The three largest stock index fund managers BlackRock, Vanguard, and Sate Street Global Advisors have quadrupled their average combined stake in S&P 500 companies over the past two decades.  The world s massive social media infrastructure and online publisher model have also contributed to the conspiracy theory pandemic. Most publishers and many authors earn much of their money by getting clicks on articles they produce, so the more outrageous the article, the more likely it is that the publisher and author will have a big payday. How many hundreds of millions of dollars did the media earn by churning out literally thousands of Trump-Russia collusion stories, most of which ended up being based on false information? It is probably to calculate, but I can say this for certain: they made a heck of a lot more money the collusion narrative than they would have made it. The truth didn t matter; the money did.  The United States has faced challenges and crossroads before, and they have come in many forms. But I am not sure that the country has ever experienced anything quite like the Great Reset. Never before have so many Americans been as eager as they are today to give away their freedoms to global elites. Never before have so many powerful U.S. business interests worked with such vigor to betray their country in pursuit of a lucrative new crony deal. Never before have American politicians and activist groups so openly demanded that more power be given to the ruling class and been [typo, my fault] by the media, Hollywood, and academic institutions with joy and excitement.  2 book reviews: Required reading for anyone who loves America  This book puts in one place most of what I had heard about the Great Reset. It also includes solutions. The one I agree with is localism: be involved in your local community. Read this book to understand what is going now, both in the US and around the world. 3 book reviews: This clarified so many facets of what is all around us.  Glenn Beck and his team have done so much in this work to bring together a clear minded analysis of the maneuvers being thrust upon us by an elite class of oligarchs who are certain that we will 'own nothing' and we will be HAPPY about it when their master plan is finally put in place. But he does not stop there. He suggests a few things we all can do to bring the nightmarish One World Order to an end. I wholly recommend you read this book if you like the nation you live in, AND that is not meant only for the United States.  4 book reviews: Beck writes about a very real problem facing this country today. I don t know if we the people can truly stop the globalization of the economy, where if you don t say or do the things government wants you to do they can control you by controlling your access to income. I think this eventually has to happen for the biblically prophesied one world order to take shape. But, I think we can perhaps slow it. Delay it to allow people to at least hear the truth. Not just about what the government is doing, but about the ultimate Truth.  5 book reviews: Well documented. The book will scare you as you discover what is happening in the US right now. I found it interesting that I ordered it from Amazon at $18.50 when it first was published. Amazon soon bumped the price to $39.50! I don t think they want it to become an Amazon Best Seller.  Bottom line: Read the book, think about it and form your own opinion. As Glenn says,  you do not have to believe every thing I write. If you disagree with me do your own research. I want to get America involved.    6 book reviews: Not Socialism or Capitalism, but Fascism Coming from the Highest Levels of Global Government.  Glenn Beck and Justin Haskins methodically lay out their case that The Great Reset is neither Socialism nor Capitalism, but rather a program of instilling 21st Century Fascism in governments across the world.  The authors do an excellent job of stitching together evidence from a variety of governmental, financial, and other leaders divulging their intent to fundamentally transform the governments of the developed world into 21st Century Fascist states with or without the knowledge, or consent, of the people. The authors extensively use direct quotes from the leaders themselves, as well as citing numerous laws, regulations, and policies which these same leaders have either enacted or advocated on their behalf.  The book was thoroughly researched and its sources are painstakingly cited, to allow the reader the opportunity to verify what has been written and decide on the validity of the books claims for themselves, based on the evidence at hand. As Glenn Beck is fond of saying, even several times in this book alone,  Don t trust me, do your own research.   I found this book to be, not the easiest of Glenn Beck s books to read, but, should his assertions prove correct, certainly his most important book.  7 book reviews: Most important chapter is chapter 5 which lays out the end goal of the Great Reset-international  stakeholder capitalism  aka corporatism-which comes after the climate and modern monetary theory chapters. The most surprising thing is how open this all is. Beck advocates libertarian and populist solutions like barring financial institutions from implementing ESG ( environmental social guidance  aka social credit score) and more broadly increase congressional representatives and a constitutional convention of the states to pass things like a balanced budget. One can favor certain policies like a carbon tax or a basic income, I think where the great reset is most objectionable is that it takes authority from elected representatives and individual consumers/investors and empowers big corporations banks and bureaucracies.  8 book reviews: This book is a must read for anyone not interested in living under the blanket of government enforced 21st century fascism. What I found most interesting is that the Great Reset (which funnily enough is what the creators of the plan themselves have decided to call it) should alert conservatives and liberals alike, and that establishment Republicans and Democrats are working together to bring us under the heel of unlimited regulation, circumventing the rights guaranteed to Americans in the Constitution. You will have to read the book for the details, a review cannot be a synopsis. It 's a nerve wracking topic once you get into it, but no one should be ignorant of the fact that it is a real threat to almost every single person in America 's way of life. That 's not hyperbole. There are 38 pages of citations for the numerous quotes in this book. The threat of fascism is real and proven, and we have to spread awareness because if the Great Reset plan is widely known, I believe both liberals and conservatives would reject it.  9 book reviews: informative  I actually thought the subject might be a little over my head so to speak. Yet I found it easy to understand and am anxious to learn more. I m going to try to do my part to get the word out. 10 book reviews: THis is a must read for everyone! We need to wake up now!! If we allow the reset to happen we wo not recognize America. Thank you Glenn Beck for writing this book!!! 11 book reviews: America 's Freedom is Worth Fighting for...  Glenn Beck brings to light the freedoms we enjoy are under assault by individuals that are greedy for power and control. It is important to spread the evils of the Great Reset before there is no turning back. Excellent research by Glenn Beck to expose the Great Reset through the supporters' own writings and quotes. No conspiracy theory, just the facts and history of the evil movement. A must read for freedom loving people who want to preserve America as we know it.  12 book reviews: Interesting read. No doubt the elites are trying to push through a reset of all of society. This book lays out what the plan is, what they doing to try to fulfill this plan & what you can do to stop it. But of course do your own follow up research after reading, don t take the authors word for it. It s full of endnotes ti follow up with. Informative and as usual depressing yet once you know the truth how can you look away?! 13 book reviews: MUST READ BOOK  MAKES A COMPLICATED SUBJECT UNDERSTANDABLE! Everyone should read it as many times as necessary to grasp the seriousness of the Great Rezet. 14 book reviews: An important wake up call  For anyone who has been asleep, this is a great introduction to the globalist agenda. For those of us who have been aware, it is helpful to see just how far the globalists have come in codifying their ESG (environmental, social, governance) according system into corporations and financial institutions. In particular, the section on modern monetary theory was especially eye opening. When the true story of this pandemic comes to light, it also reveals the true identity of these resetters. It 's all about money and power. When everyone sees the genocide that this group has just orchestrated, they will be ready to read this book and take the country back. Thanks, Glenn!  15 book reviews: Open your eyes.  I never had much contact or knowledge of Gen Beck. This book certainly helps me understand what I have been missing. We all need to understand that we really ca not risk being only observant bystanders and be more involved. This is a great read well worth my and your time. 16 book reviews: Hard truth  5 stars for making the most complicated nonsense both digestible and humorous. Not an easy task. This book is well written and well documented. It 's also scary, but these are scary times. This book has made me eager to find out more, on both sides. 17 book reviews: The next three years could decide our future  The truth will set you free if you recognize it vs the misinformation disseminated in much of our media. This book provides not only truth but answers. Is America listening? READ this and make your own decision. The fate of the country rests upon an awakening. 18 book reviews: well Written and massively Footnoted  I have read many books in this fringe opinion genre, but rarely one so well and firmly constructed that the personal opinion of the author on the cover didn t ruin the readability.  This summary is mostly checkable facts with occasional comments inserted in the first person.  The facts, names, titles and actions of the public personalities are arranged in an order that makes sense of all the current news items you see from the mainstream outlets. You probably already know most of this material, but the obscure bits dredged up by this research team connect the dots into a new picture well worth thinking about.  19 book reviews: A must read  Every American who loves this country should read this book, study what is happening to this country and ACT! Inform yourself and help save our republic! 20 book reviews: Very Good Book! 21 book reviews: A must read for freedom lovers everywhere  It is important for each of us to understand the Great Reset that elitists, government leaders around the world, corporations and banks are trying to force on us. Trying to understand the concepts outlined herein can us combat this evil plan. 22 book reviews: Glenn makes complex subjects easy to understand. A must read for anyone that wants to protect our freedom and way of life from those trying to destroy them. Exceedingly well researched and documented. 23 book reviews: very enlightening  An eye opening account of what s happening in our country that not many people are aware of. Especially the education system turning students against the United States. 24 book reviews: An eye opener!  Glenn Beck does a great job explaining how the Great Reset is systematically advancing all around us, and gives some very strong options to help us reverse this trend and save our blessed republic!! 25 book reviews: Information is power  An informative book about the current state of affairs. With footnotes galore to back all Beck has written. Research all sources listed and get involved before it is too late. It can be stopped. 26 book reviews: This is a must read for all.  Beck does a great job of attaching events and actions with real explanations that your brain will say, \"Oh yeah, this all makes sense\". A call to action for Americans. 27 book reviews: Some scary s#%t. I was relieved by all the 1-star reviews I saw on Klaus 's book (which basically is basically coming right out and confirming everything Beck alleges in this book).  I plan to do more homework . . . but this appears to be real and dangerous. 28 book reviews: It was a scary look into the near future about government control 29 book reviews: After hearing so much about The Great Reset for the past couple of years, I was finally curious enough to delve into what The Great Reset actually is. From information gathered on the Internet and in this book, it is a concept that was introduced at the World Economic Forum in 2020 by multimillionaire Klaus Schwab. The idea was to use the world disruption caused by COVID-19 to restructure the world and how it operates (see Klaus Schwab s book, COVID-19: The Great Reset). The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an organization founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab. It is composed of the world s wealthiest and most powerful people and meets annually in Davos, Switzerland. Its goal is to reshape the world for the greater good, as the WEF defines that world.  The two concepts which pose the greatest concern to me is the movement toward the Modern Monetary Theory (see this article in ), which states that a government which prints its own money should be able to print as much currency as it needs to run the federal government and not be concerned about accumulated deficits. This to me flies in the face of reason, but unfortunately, many economists and politicians are becoming accepting of this concept.  The second concept which concerns me is the move toward implementing ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) requirements for governments, banking, business and individuals. The concepts are explained on the ESG|The Report website (). In a nutshell, each entity is/will be assigned a score based on their ESG compliance, and this score will affect each entity s ability to do business. To me, this sounds like the western version of China s social credit score (see an overview of China s social credit score at ).  This book, with its 511 references, guided me to seek out direct sources in understanding the complicated concept of The Great Reset. It is a great resource to begin one s own research.  ",
    " The Lincoln Highway: A Novel": "book reviews: After loving the author 's previous two books, one of which is an all-time favorite of mine, no one 's more surprised than me that I did not end up loving The Lincoln Highway.  Emmett has just been released from a juvenile detention facility after serving time for involuntary manslaughter. Now that his father has passed away and he no longer has family in town, he plans to pick up his little brother and drive along the Lincoln Highway to California so that they can start anew. But his carefully laid plans fall by the wayside when his friends show up and force him to embark on a different journey altogether.  I hate to say it, but this book confused me. I thought Emmett was our protagonist, and I was all ready to cheer him on as he did whatever he needed to do to start a new life, mainly by driving along the Lincoln Highway (hence the name of the book, right?). But this must be a case of mismatched expectations because Emmett was not the actual focus of this book and he did not drive along that namesake road.  Emmett is but one character out of many in this book, and he shares equal limelight with them all. Each of these characters has their points of view and ample time in the book, filled with their corresponding backgrounds and narratives. But the issue is that the tales of these side characters are not vital to the story. You can just cut out their turns and still have essentially the same story overall. So to include them made the whole thing feel bloated and unfocused.  It does not help that a bunch of the side characters kept clowning around and getting up to shenanigans throughout the entire book. It almost feels like slapstick comedy, where outrageous things happen just for some laughs. This was especially odd because a lot of the notable events in here were people getting beat up or killed. But there was this incongruous, jokey tone permeating those scenes that did not really go with whatever horrible event was happening.  That is not to say this was all bad. I still enjoyed Towles 's writing, even if I did not really connect with the story. He always includes these little bits of wisdom coated in humor, and I gobbled up the Greek mythology references in here, as well as the trip down memory lane to FAO Schwarz. Clearly Towles was paying homage to 1950s Americana, and he does well from the parts I could pick up. But in the end, I just was not the right audience for this book, and I hope other readers trying this will have better luck than I did.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~         1 book reviews: I ve been writing short reviews these last couple of months, but I knew at some point a book would come along and I d be compelled to say more about it than just a few sentences. ******** I thought I was going on an adventure across the country on the Lincoln Highway, but I found myself on a journey of the heart with these characters, looking for  fresh starts  , each of them discovering who they are, how they fit into this world, each one having been abandoned in one way or another, each one rising up to meet their fate, trying to make amends. They don t actually cross the country from New York to California in 1954, but take a detour from farm country in Nebraska to New York City (and what an ode to New York City ! ). Three teenage boys, one just released from a juvenile work farm, two who have escaped, are flawed and well meaning, trying to do the right thing. And oh my heart, the eight year old brother of the first boy, who is precocious, yet sweet in his na vet  and belief in heroes.  It s about heroes, too, not just the ones in the book that Billy carries with him, but these unforgettable characters who are heroes in their own right to each other in some way, along with some other characters who I was touched by. I loved everything about this novel - the seamless way that Towles takes his readers to a time and place, the way he bridges that connection between fiction and life. He s an extraordinary storyteller. Despite its length, I didn t want it to end, didn t want to leave these characters whose journeys reflect love and friendship, sadness and joy and are filled with the stuff that life is made of.   As always a pleasure to read with Diane and Esil.  2 book reviews: ***NOW AVAILABLE, ONE OF MY TOP 10 BOOKS OF THE YEAR***  5+++++ stars  DO YOU WANT TO GO ON A ROAD TRIP????  The year is 1954 and our trip will take place along The Lincoln Highway. We ll start in New York City and travel to the end in San Francisco. What you won t know is how many different  side trips  and wonderful characters that you will encounter on your way. . Buckle up HERE WE GO!!!!!!  READY TO MEET YOUR FELLOW TRAVELERS?  Emmet Watson, age 18 is being driven to his home in Nebraska after having been released from a juvenile work farm. Emmet s mother has been absent for many years and now his father has passed away and the family home and failed farm are in foreclosure. Emmet will have sole custody of his younger brother Billy. He has come home to settle things and to pick up his brother and his car. He is ready to start life anew, out of Nebraska and headed West, Texas or California.  Young Billy Watson has been waiting for his brother s return for 18 months. He welcomes him with open arms!!!!!!!  After their father died, a neighbor and friend watched Billy until Emmett was released. Billy is a curious little guy, super intelligent and with lots of love to share, he has some interesting tastes in books!  His very favorite  big red book'' is something he keeps in his backpack at all times.  PROFESSOR ABACUS ABERNATHE S COMPENDIUM OF HEROES, ADVENTURERS AND OTHER INTREPID TRAVELERS . Given to him by the school librarian it is his most prized possession! Billy will read many stories to friends along the way!!  As soon as the warden drives away, two of Emmet s friends from the farm appear on his doorstep, having hidden in the back of the truck, they still have part of their  sentence  to complete.  Duchess is a  wild and crazy  guy. He s mostly kind hearted but has hatched a plan with Wooley that should get them all a lot of money.  He s an alcoholic and often not dependable. But when he sets his mind on something he will pursue it at all costs.  Wooley, is a well intentioned friend and will do anything for those he cares about. He is estranged from his wealthy family. He will, however, inherit money from his grandfather when he turns 18. Wooley isn t really that interested in the money, to him friendship and trust are more important. He is a somewhat troubled young man, always different from his peers, and often ignored by his family. He always felt like a PIECE OF A PUZZLE THAT DIDN'T FIT!  I completely lost myself in this story. Mr. Towles is a master storyteller. While I enjoyed his prior books, this one is definitely my favorite. This novel and cast of characters drew me in. It is, of course, beautifully and meticulously written. At times a bit wordy, I loved how this group of adventurers continued to get side tracked to different places. THAT S A LOT LIKE LIFE ITSELF!!!  The characters are so real, I feel a little lost now that the book is over. I had to wait a day to write this review because I knew I would  gush  and I still have.  This is a book that I would love to put into everyone s hands! It s about family that we are born into and families that are  made  by a combination of the people we love.  This is a quote from the novel  Wouldn t it have been wonderful, thought Woolly, if everybody s life was like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. . . .one person s life would just fit snugly in its very own, specially designed spot, and in so doing, would enable the whole intricate picture to become complete . Is that not a beautiful quote?  This novel is set to publish on October 5, 2021.  I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher and author through Edelweiss.  ,  3 book reviews: Choo choo choo! That s the sound of my disappointment train which suddenly left the town. With this ominous cue you may sense some very unpopular review is on its way!  I m not sure if it s about my changing literary taste or dark winter mood, but lately I start showing less interest to highly appraised and five starred books! After seeing those high recommendations, I thought I would absolutely love this book from the author of Gentleman in Moscow! I have to admit: the beginning was so promising and gripping which made me think I found another five starred gem but  till the characters hit the road, everything has changed, things got repetitive, new characters were thrown into equation and I didn t like them much. Actually I showed no interest to learn more about their stories. And that ending .should I say disappointed, abrupt, empty  I don t know what adjective I may use to define the ending without giving spoilers.  I think I was expecting something more than reading a story about teenage boys and tangerine obsession.  The beginning was impressive. In 1954, at a juvenile work farm, Emmett Watson who served for fifteen months because of manslaughter is getting to be driven to his house in Nebraska. His father passed away and his mother is long gone so only he and his eight years old brother left. The bank is already planning to take over the family farm. So at young age, his plan to have fresh start is driving to California with his brother Billy. But unfortunately the warden s car which will take him to his home is already taken over by two friends at friend and now they are both headed to Big Apple . After that point the story s direction absolutely changed. And I didn t enjoy it!  Well, of course I m not gonna give two stars !I really don t want to get booed! ( it happened to me when I wrote my unpopular review to Cloud Cuckoo Land) I m giving my solid three stars! I was expecting so much more but actually this book was definitely not for me!  4 book reviews: Audiobook .read by Edoardo Ballerini, Marin Ireland, Dion Graham  ..16 hours and 39 minutes  Being a   .HUGE FAN of  A Gentleman in Moscow  and  Rules of Civility  I was excited as any other fan to dive into Towles third novel. However    The Lincoln Highway  wasn t my cup of tea.  Great beginning  But . as the story moved along, the adventures and stories grew tiresome to me. I grew tired of Billy s young voice. His zealous fervent perky-curiosity became annoying and laborious to me.  I wasn t a fan of many of the devious-clownish characters.  I didn t care for theatrical stories of Hercules, Galileo, Edison, or other imperial dramaturgic tales. I didn t want a Shakespeare lesson   I had no interest in the sailboat stories  or  Heroes of legends Sorcery and enchantment intervention of the Gods   or  Toys in FOA Schwarz . or  lessons on how to make strawberry jam or pie   I didn t mesh with some of the quirkiness- words-of- wisdom  slants  Example:  When a piano falls out of the window and lands on a persons head there s a good chance he ll understand why he deserved it .  Plenty of repetitiveness, too. How many times did I need to hear about the nine postcards?  Sometimes I felt that had Towles written this as a middle school children s book -it could have been brilliant- but as an adult book mixed with childish stories - it just didn t work for me.  I didn t care for the mischievous humor-satire-ish-thriller-ish .book that this was.  That said  Amor Towles is an eloquent -talented writer/storyteller. I admire him - and seriously loved his past two novels.   The Lincoln Highway  had powerful underline messages about human behaviors which were heartfelt  but the adventurous-packaging that they came in was too fatiguing to me.  2 star-personal enjoyment .(I don t like sour cream either),   so this is just a personal preference review . not a slam on the author whatsoever.  4 stars for Amor Towles eloquent skills.  Rounding out my final rating to 3 stars.  5 book reviews: holy cow. this roadtrip is a nightmare. everything that can go wrong, does. all because of duchess, who is one of the most unenjoyable characters to read about in the history of books. and honestly, this is probably closer to a 2 star read, but the relationship between emmett and his younger brother, billy, deserves so much better than that.  and its such a tremendous shame that too many other POVs take away from this amazing brotherly bond. i found nearly every character POV, other than emmetts, to be lacking and begging to be skimmed. with the exception of duchess and sometimes woolly, whose POVs do progress the plot, every other POV could be cut from the story without consequence. sure, they add some side stories but, for me, they just took away page time that could have been better spent on emmett and billy. the removal of these very distant side characters also would have helped with the long length and slow pacing.  but gosh. again, i keep going back and thinking about emmett and billy. their connection is just too wholesome. i love their dynamic - emmetts cautious protection and billy innocent affection. they both steal whatever scene they are in and truly outshine all of the other characters. i easily could have read 600+ pages of just them and given it 5 stars.  this also has some really great writing and storytelling with quintessential AT charm throughout. so its a shame that the story is bogged down by unlikeable and unnecessary characters.   6 book reviews: Another winner from the talent that is Mr Amor Towles .  It s June 1954, and 18 year old Emmett Watson is being driven home by Warden Williams after serving time in a Kansas youth facility. Emmett has to tie up his late father s estate, and then he and his little brother Billy will be leaving town for a fresh start in life.  Emmett and Billy have different ideas about which direction they should head - Billy wants to follow the Lincoln Highway, where their mother, (who walked out on the family many years ago) is thought to be living. Emmett wants to follow wherever the work is, however, much to Emmett s surprise, Duchess and Wooly, who are still supposed to be serving time in the facility where Emmett was, have managed to secrete themselves in the trunk of Warden William s car, and are intent on a road trip of their own! What follows is madness and mayhem, but what a journey!  What an inventive and absorbing read this is. The characters are wonderful - all memorable in their own special way, the storyline is just an escapade full of humour and joy, not to mention some moving scenes thrown in for good measure. Can t praise it enough!  *Thank you to Netgalley and Random House UK Cornerstone for an arc in exchange for an honest unbiased review*  7 book reviews: Amor Towles spins a beguiling and rollicking historical adventure set in the 1950s, brilliantly imaginative, and with an unforgettable cast of characters, ostensibly about a Lincoln Highway road trip to California that keeps gets derailed. 18 year old Emmet Watson is a surprisingly composed and mature young man, who arrives back home to Morgen, Nebraska, after serving a sentence for involuntary manslaughter at a juvenile work farm in Salina. His unsuccessful farmer father has died, debts mean their family farm has been foreclosed upon by the bank. None of this is a shock to Emmet, he has planned for new beginnings, to pick up his 8 year old brother, Billy, driving in his 1948 Studebaker, to start a more secure future in California, where it appears their mother went after abandoning them years ago.  However, two of his friends, Duchess and Wooley, from Salena have escaped, hiding in the car that Emmet was driven home in by the warden, and they have other more immediate ideas of going to New York. Duchess is a good, if frustrating, man, but his ideas and misguided good intentions fail to take account of the consequences of his actions, he seeks to balance the scales of justice in his life, which includes taking a beating that he feels he deserves. Wooley is a dreamer, out of sync with the world and his wealthy family 's expectations, requiring medication for his condition, looking for a one of a kind day rather than the normal every day kind of days, he has access to money that could set all of them for the new lives they all dream of. So begin a series of adventures, where Billy 's precious book, Professor Abernathe 's Compendium is key, including a thrilling freight train journey to New York, taking in a circus, the Empire State Building and so much more.  They encounter a memorable set of characters on their oddyssey, including the Great Ulysses in search of his wife and child, a villainous Pastor John, Wooley 's sister, Sarah, and are joined by the remarkable Sally from Nebraska. Towles vibrant storytelling is spellbinding, oozing with a sense of magical wonder, with its echoes of ancient myths, legends and heroes, brought to life in 1950s America. This is a beautiful, multilayered read, of life, brothers, love, friendship, the spirit of adventure, misfits that a world struggles to accommodate, and the heartbreak of tragedy. I adored young Billy, wise beyond his years, with his heart of gold and simplicity that cuts through what might be thought of as logical and normal. A superb novel that I recommend highly, a wonderful must read. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.  8 book reviews: Still catching up on books I finished this spring. My apologies. THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY is a gem. I adored Amor Towles 's first two novels, and I savored every moment of this one. It 's 1954, and three young men and a boy are on the adventure of their lives, traveling between the Midwest and Manhattan and the Adirondacks, and while there are meticulous reasons for their incredible journey, what makes this masterpiece work are each of the characters. They have their scars and their demons and their eccentricities. Two you will want to take under your wing and adopt; one will leave you uneasy; and one just might have in him the stuff of heroism. All of them you will care about deeply. I savored this book: every page.  9 book reviews: It took a long time for me to make it to the  Lincoln Highway  and what a long winding road / read it was, but what an adventure and what a touching exploration of human nature with this intricate character study from the master storyteller that is Amor Towles.  A mix of very ordinary and extraordinary events shape the lives of two brothers and two uninvited travelling companions. With a hint of tragedy looming from the opening pages and a sense of the inevitable you know fate will play its part.  Once again, I find myself asking the same question about an Amor Towles book. Why do I love this so much and the answer is the same? I just do!! There is nothing sensational about the plot, the language, or its characters, but there is something sensational about the way the stories are perfectly nuanced, the characters are intimately observed, and the story is beautifully written.    The year is 1954 when the story begins with a warden releasing 18 year old Emmett Watson from a detention centre for involuntary manslaughter. After serving 15 months, Emmett is released on compassionate grounds after the death of their father to care for his younger brother Billy.  Deciding to make a fresh start, Emmett, and Billy plan to travel along the Lincoln Highway to California to locate their mother, who abandoned the family years earlier. That is until they meet up with two of Emmett s fellow inmates and now escapees; the dangerous swindler that is Duchess Hewitt and Woolly Martin, a man addicted to prescription medicine.  The story is a time capture odyssey of one week, with a smooth transition from one chapter to the next as the four main characters narrate in the first person providing the history to their story as they learn to live in the present, deal with the past and look forward to their future.  The lives of the four males become so entwined and all of them are taken on a different journey and in a direction that has some devastating consequences. The road is perilous, their mission is thwart with obstacles and the outcome reflected the tragedy and justice you often get from Greek Mythology   which the book often references.      was superb and the dynamics between the group and between individuals within the group make this such a unique and extraordinary story.  With the 3 teenagers all aged 18, the perfect backdrop of people on a journey was created. Emmett, Duchess and Woolly were at that crossroads in life when they transition from boys to men but also an opportunity to put right the wrong start and decisions they had made to that point. However, with the desire for retribution, a past haunting them and an opportunity to make money fast, you are totally caught up in their dilemma between doing what is right and wrong. For themselves and the others in the group where the emotional intelligence seems to constantly work against them.  The only character that jarred with me was Billy who was wise beyond his years, and although I enjoyed the character, I would have preferred he was cast a few years older. It would have avoided the constant eye roll from me, because sometimes he felt a precocious little twirp, but still adorable when his innocence shone through.    was saved by the story telling. First of all, what was wrong with the plot? There was not much substance to the plot and events and conversations were often repeated. There is something wrong with the plot when I only decided I loved this book halfway in and then the ending felt a bit incomplete and lacked the closure I wanted for the four boys.  Then I reflected on the closing chapters for a while and concluded that the ending was in fact perfect and did not need a contrived happy ending for everyone. The book is permeated with so much light and darkness, with loss and hope, that it would have been wrong to write the ending differently.  There is an understated elegance to the writing, brilliant in its simplicity and tragic with its constant referencing back to Greek mythology.  There is no doubt that Amor Towles is the master storyteller who does not need the sensational twists or bold characters to tell a story. The mood and the relaxed tone of his writing together with the delicate way he deals with strong themes all create the right atmosphere and a fabulous reading experience.  (4.5 stars rounded up) so 5 stars overall for a book that is incredibly touching in its sentiment and heart breaking in some of its story. A coming of age story that is not about adolescent outbursts but a story of 4 males trying to make life decisions in a world that they have not learned to live in yet.  Enthralling and life affirming with some epic qualities to the storytelling and characterisation.  10 book reviews: Five stars. It might only be the first week of 2022, but I have a feeling this will be my favorite book of the year. It s been a long time since a book tugged at my emotions like this one did. It grabbed me, and over and over again, I found myself gripping my chest. It hurt. It scared me. But yes, I also laughed. It s an adventure story, an odyssey, an  escapade , as Duchess calls it, with undertones of mythology. Everyone has hopes and dreams and they clash because not a single one can be realized without denying someone else theirs. As with his other books, the writing is gorgeous. Towles has a way of creating characters and putting them in scenes so realistic, it was like watching a movie. He has a real knack for setting the time and place. I wanted to savor each moment while at the same time frantic to see how this story would play out for each of the main characters. But not just the main characters, I found myself caring for even the secondary characters. I even loved Duchess, a total scoundrel if ever there was one, even as I was shouting at him multiple times to stop his nefarious deeds. And oh, that ending. Talk about being caught off guard. I listened to this and bravo to the narrators. Each definitely added to my enjoyment.  11 book reviews: It is hard for me to rate this book because I loved the first third and was extremely disappointed by the rest.  While listening to the first 30% of this book I was so enamored with the writing and the characters I was sure that this novel was going to be my favorite book of the year. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. As soon as the boys hit the road toward the Lincoln Highway Amor Towles' brain was taken over by a much lesser writer who specializes in stories for teenage boys and loves tangents. Many new characters are introduced, none of whom grabbed my interest. The story lost momentum and I began to skip the chapters which were not narrated by the 2 main protagonists and Sally. I loved Sally. She had some of the best lines. After praying to God for months that her father will marry the woman he is dating and therefore have someone other than herself responsible for cooking and cleaning for him she is sorely disappointed when they stop dating. And she quips:  \"They say the lord answers all prayers ....but sometimes he answers 'no.'\"  I was shocked by the ending. Where did that come from? It changed the tone of the book from folksy, old fashioned story telling to... well, telling would be a spoiler.  I loved but nothing of Towles' since, including . I know. I know. I tried to read it twice but it never captured my attention. I am sure it was all me. One day I will try again. I was definitely in the minority on \"Gentlemen\" just as I seem to be in the minority on .  12 book reviews:   for most people, it doesn t matter where they live. When they get up in the morning, they re not looking to change the world  And if it doesn t matter for most people where they live, it certainly doesn t matter where they re going. That s what gave the Lincoln Highway its charm.   Let me start by saying that I absolutely adored both Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow. They remain two of my very favorite books, with copies of both holding special places on my bookshelf designated for such treasures. Amor Towles soared to the top of my author list. However, just as brothers Emmett and Billy s plans to travel to San Francisco to find their mother (who abandoned them eight years ago) went way off course in , this reading experience derailed for me in a pretty big way, too. That s as far as I m going with the clich d phrases, however, because that was one of the problems I had with this book  lack of subtlety and the too-obvious feeling that the entire story was a parable of sorts. I m sorry to admit it, and I hate to complain about this novel. I just don t do well with tales that set out to impart some moral wisdom, especially when I don t feel as if I ve learned any lesson by the end. In fact, I was a bit puzzled by the final act.    If precocious children and adventure stories are your cup of tea, then you will very likely find this book to be rather charming and highly entertaining. It s not told from just eight-year-old Billy s point of view, however. The story alternates, quite quickly, between the various characters that Towles has dreamed up. I don t mind switching from one person to the next, if that allows me to gain a better perspective of each character. In fact, just before this book, I read , which had a similar structure. In that one, however, the reader was allowed to spend a great deal of time with one character before moving along to the next. Each person had more depth as a result. Here, Towles rapidly jumps from one to the next before I had enough time to truly appreciate the company. Again, if you re in it for the fast-paced action, then this works quite well. As a reflective reader, this didn t appeal to me personally. I m also not opposed to precocious children, as a rule, but when they seem too good to be true, well, I get a little bored. Billy is not the only one rather mature for his age. Given the fact that Emmett, Duchess, and Wooly had all been inmates at a working farm for juvenile delinquents, it was safe to assume that they all landed there before the age of eighteen. This story takes place right after Emmett has served his time. Emmett, Duchess and even Sally (Emmett s next door neighbor, peer and former if not current object of affection) were all wise beyond their years. I realize that hardship and an early dependence on oneself to get by when a parent or two is absent can make for more quick-witted and self-sufficient temperaments, but I couldn t get past the fact that so many of these young adults were gifted with these qualities. I have to admit, I felt the presence of the author himself while reading.    Enough about my quibbles for now. There were indeed some satisfying points to , and it wouldn t be fair for me to ignore them. One thing that I could fully relate to was Billy s love for reading. His most prized possession is always at hand   a beautifully bound book of adventure stories written by Professor Abernathe. He opens the book and shares the wonders inside with anyone who will listen. Which one of us doesn t hope for such a captive audience when we want to gush about our favorite stories?! Then there was Ulysses, a man who has consigned himself to a fate much like the fabled Ulysses. He s been traveling by rail aimlessly and illegally for years to atone for a transgression. He s in search of a wife and son. I could have happily spent a lot more time in his company. One thing that Towles always does so well is drop the reader smack dab in the middle of his settings. 1950s America, the railways, and New York City were all brought to life with his magical words. The idea that life does not travel a straight path is one that s examined often in literature. It s forever winding and changing course. The mention of Zeno s paradox, the inability to get from point A to point B, is even thrown in for good measure. Towles manages the whole thing in a fun, engaging way. Despite the fact that this novel felt less substantial (not page-wise!) and more young adult-like to me, there s no doubt in my mind that I ll read Towles again. I like it best when Towles sticks to a small cast and a smaller scope. I m happy to be locked up in a hotel room or just wandering the streets of New York City rather than traversing the United States! You must judge for yourself, however   I m clearly an outlier!      13 book reviews: I feel like I ve just been tucked in: snug as a bug in a rug, by this masterful storyteller.  Towles has a way of writing that sweeps a reader away to where only the story matters. A journey of sorts - a new beginning. It s 1954. What becomes a direct route along the Lincoln highway - which stretches from the east coast to the west- quickly becomes a backward one. Emmett, who has just finished his time in a juvenile detention, goes home for his younger brother, Billy, to begin their trip. Two other boys - Woolly and Duchess- show up the same day having escaped from the farm. And so it begins.  Without going into detail, you can savour this one yourself with a brandy by the fire. The characters are unique, authentic and just as charming as the writing.  If you want an adventure, you ve arrived at the right spot. Sit back, settle in and enjoy this divine ride.  And If you haven t read , I urge you do so.  There is just something so mesmerizing and hypnotizing about Towles' writing that you ll pause for a long bit after and realize what a pleasure the journey was. 5   14 book reviews: A madcap adventure story, a fantastical story set in the fifties, a story about retribution, forgiveness missed connections, and peopled with some outstanding characters. An ode to reading, travel and the family we have, the family we make.  Towels has the talent to entertain with his scenarios, to pull a reader into a time period, a situation, to make the unbelievable, believable and to entertain so well that almost 600 pages just flyby. These are characters that one does not easily forget, even what one would call minor characters are central to the plot. One in particular is very young, Billy, but at times it seems he has more belief and wisdom than his elders.  I am not quite sure I understand the ending but I intend soon to go back and re-read, and discussing with Angela and Esil will I am sure aid in my endeavor. Another unforgettable story from Towles.  15 book reviews: I know I am in the minority, but perhaps because I am not a fan of quest books, this one didn t live up to the hype for me. I say that having absolutely loved Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow. So I eagerly awaited receiving my copy, and I read it through to completion. I didn t find the characters likable or the plot plausible. It meandered through irrelevant and illogical anecdotes. By the end, I didn t care what happened to any of them. It also made maneuvering across the country and navigating NYC seem extremely uncomplicated and easy for 1954. All you needed was a Howard Johnson s map. And it was incredibly easy to find people you were looking for. At times I wondered if this really was a myth or fantasy. The writing, as would be expected, was terrific, but other than for that, I don t know anyone for whom I could recommend this book. Now that I think about it, people who had read advance copies just told me to read it. They never told me why I would enjoy it.  16 book reviews: 5   592 pages and I miss each and every one of them. I want to start it over again. 17 book reviews: It s June 12th 1954 and Warden Williams is taking eighteen year old Emmett Watson home from Salina, a juvenile reform program after which Emmett s debt to society is paid in full. His father has died, his bank loans against it are called in and the farm is to be sold. His eight year old brother Billy shows him a map of the Lincoln Highway stretching east to west, their intention is to drive Emmett 's 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser westwards to San Francisco. However, best laid plans and all that, when everything is thrown up in the air by the unexpected arrival of Duchess and Woolly from Salina. What transpires over the next ten days is very far from what the Watson brothers imagine especially as it becomes clear that Duchess and Emmett are on a collision course. The story is told from multiple points of view.  What an adventure! It is no surprise that this is brilliantly written, it s extremely creative, imaginative and so vivid. The characters are superbly crafted, they feel authentic and real and whilst three of them have erred there is an elegant yet simple morality to them , with Emmett being an especially good man. Billy for me is the stand out character, I just fall in love with his thoughtful yet simple approach to life, his sweetness, wisdom and intelligence and particularly how he is inspired and guided by Professor Abacus Abernathe s Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and other Intrepid Travellers. This is a key component of the novel and a great deal mirrors the compendium with a sense of it being prophetic. There ARE heroes, certainly adventurers, they meet intrepid travellers and on more than one occasion the book saves Billy and the rest of them. Their journey deviates, as does the storytelling but it does take you to some magical and fantastical places. At times the book is funny, at others it makes you uneasy and has shocks and surprises along the way. As the story meanders east before heading west ( you ll have to read the book to find out why  ) on occasions it feels like a madcap movie like a Chaplin or Keaton silent film caper which incidentally are mentioned in passing(!) with these scenes being especially delicious!! The dialogue is  absotively  brilliant making you want to join in. As it reaches a conclusion it takes a darker turn, which I guess has been in the cards with the signs there for all to see.  Overall, I think this is an excellent and original novel. The storytelling is lively, engaging, takes the reader on a wild ride as it twists and turns away from the brothers original intention and into some lively and unexpected situations. It s a character driven study with all the facets of humankind on display, the good, the bad and the endearingly wonderful.  With thanks to NetGalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.  18 book reviews: 2.75 stars  All aboooooooard! There is a love train for this book and it 's filling up fast. That train will be leaving the station without me. Amor Towles is a gifted storyteller. The trouble here was that he could not seem to decide which story he wanted to tell. So he told them all. In one novel. What it felt like to me was that he knew a lot of odd and eccentric things about the early to mid-20th century, and he wanted to find a way to include them all in the book. So we get digression after digression as we are introduced to a parade of peripheral characters and their life histories. This would have been a much better novel if it were more focused, and if Emmett and Billy had actually driven to California as planned.  19 book reviews: I can t tell you how excited I was that Amor Towles came out with a new book! And it s a road trip!!  The historic Lincoln Highway  It 's 1954, and 18 year old Emmett Watson has just finished serving time at a Kansas juvenile work farm for accidentally killing a boy who was bullying him. His mother abandoned their family years ago, and his father, a man haunted by his failure at farming, has just died, and the bank is poised to foreclose. Emmett does not mind losing his home because he 's got a plan: pack up his 8 y.o. brother Billy and start a new life in Texas. But \"California,\" says Billy, certain that 's where their long-lost mother is living. They can drive the Lincoln Highway to San Francisco and be there by the 4th of July.  But as it turns out, neither Texas nor California is in their immediate future. Two of Emmett 's friend from the work farm, Duchess and Woolly, broke out of the facility early and propose going the opposite way, to New York City, where Woolly 's large inheritance is hidden in a family safe. If Emmett takes them there, Woolly will split the cash between the four of them.  Emmett is determined to stay on the right side of the law and wants nothing to do with this plan, but things happen. Well, mostly Duchess   a clever, charming and utterly self-centered young man   happens. Duchess and Woolly take off to New York with Emmett 's car (not to mention Emmett 's cash hidden in the trunk), and Emmett, now destitute, decides to chase them down the only way he can think of. He and Billy stow away in an empty car of a freight train heading to New York City. Their adventure is just beginning.  is one of those books that got better and better the further I got into it. Amor Towles' (author of ) take on mid-20th century road trip is given such an original twist here, and Towles' gift for writing shines through and takes this novel to a whole new level. The boys' adventures are related with sympathy and insight. The characters are also fascinating (with the possible exception of Woolly, who never felt quite real for me). I especially like   and hated   Duchess, an unreliable narrator whose charming exterior hides a darker core, and I loved Billy, a bright and occasionally unworldly boy (I think he may be on the moderate side of the spectrum, though it 's never explicitly said).  One of my favorite subplots of the book involves Billy 's favorite book, When Billy meets a black wanderer named Ulysses, it feels fateful, and Billy 's love for literature and faith in Ulysses' story help change the paths of several lives, including that of the book 's author.     Highly recommended!  Bonus material: Towles talks about this book and gives some fascinating insights into the plot, why he chose this particular time in history for the setting, and the book 's structure, including the reason why the book 's sections count down for each day rather than usual method of counting up.  Original post: I am very proud of myself for catching this one on my library 's online catalog before it was even on the shelf and putting in a hold. It 's now in my hands! Hoping I will love it as much as I did .  20 book reviews: \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\" Ralph Waldo Emerson  How many ever reach their destination, their dream of what might be? Life takes us all on side trips, some more enjoyable than others. Would Homer 's epic poem have lasted through the ages if Odysseus had gone right home to Penelope? It is a great theme and Towles, mostly, does a terrific job taking us along with the four boys on this meandering trip.  I enjoyed the shared narration. I thought the characters were well-developed, except for Emmett. He just did not have the charm and charisma of Billy, Duchess, and Wooly. Although Sally played a lesser role in the story, her nascent feminist views as well as her bigheartedness felt real and relatable. Wooly reminded me of Forrest Gump, simple and yet profound. His fascination with Lincoln and his unworldliness were endearing. He was too gentle and pure for this messy world. Duchess, the lovable scoundrel, who due to his horrible childhood and abandonment, needed to learn how to survive, how to thrive in one way or another. And Billy - who would not love a little boy so in love with a book of twenty heroes, each one better known to him than any of his family members.  I loved Towles' beautiful sentences and pearls of wisdom in his first two books, and he did not disappoint me in this one.  EMMETT \"Was not it hard enough in the course of life to distinguish between fact and fantasy, be- tween what one witnessed and what one wanted?\" DUCHESS \"When it comes to waiting, has-beens have had plenty of practice. Waiting for their big break, or the bars to open or the welfare check to arrive.\" WOOLY \"Questions can be so tricky, like forks in the road. You can be having such a nice conversation and someone will raise a questions and the next thing you know you are headed off in a whole new direction.\" \"The funny thing about a picture is that while it knows everything that 's happening up until the moment its been taken, it knows absolutely nothing about what will happen next.\" SALLY \"I do it because it takes time. And I do it because it is unnecessary. For kindness begins where necessity ends.\"  Although I prefer lengthy books, those that give me time to become totally immersed in the story and the characters, The Lincoln Highway had too many unnecessary details. Some of the period add-ons seemed \"in your face\", not well embedded in the narration ( a pet peeve of mine). I thought the vocabulary of Duchess and Sally unrealistically sophisticated for their backgrounds. Lastly, the ending did not seem true to Emmett 's character. Yet, Towles does describe the best of people and the worst of people, the saints and the sinners and all those in between. Will that long and winding road lead to her door as it does in the Beatles' classic? Maybe not, but it was a fun ride.  21 book reviews:  ...for most people, it doesn t matter where they live. When they get up in the morning, they re not looking to change the world. They want to have a cup of coffee and a piece of toast, put in their eight hours, and wrap up the day with a bottle of beer in front of the TV set. More of less, it s what they d be doing whether they lived in Atlanta, Georgia, or Nome, Alaska. And if it doesn t matter for most people where they live, it certainly doesn t matter where they re going.  That s what gave the Lincoln Highway its charm.  When you see the highway on a map, it looks like that Fisher guy Billy was talking about took a ruler and drew a line straight across the country, mountains and rivers be damned. In so doing, he must have imagined it would provide a timely conduit for the movement of goods and ideas from sea to shining sea, in a final fulfillment of manifest destiny. But everyone we passed just seemed to have a satisfied sense of their own lack of purpose. say the Irish, and that s what was happening to the intrepid travelers on the Lincoln Highway. It was rising up to meet each and every one of them, whether they were headed east, headed west, or going around in circles.   reads like one of those long Sunday drives wandering here and there without a specific destination in mind, wandering to and fro... Until, that is, all the back roads it follows lead to one road which was your fate. Like which leads to your door, the place where you end up even when it wasn t your destination, but more like your destiny. It floats along, and we re glad to be a part of the journey, even if we are only silently observing these characters, and the journeys - both physical and emotional - they are on. It has the adventure of Tom Sawyer, and the charm, as well as the relative innocence associated with the era which makes for a delicious combination. A sense of an almost magical journey that offers a wistfulness that gives a nod to that essence of Dorothy s journey, including the flying monkeys, with the wicked witch replaced by other nefarious characters in search of this story s version of the ruby slippers, with the charm of Dorothy s crew of the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and the Tin Man being found in the characters in the journey of Courage, heart and brains make up the ingredients for the magical spell this casts. Throw in a sprinkling of a few Marx brothers type moments for some laughs, as well.  What made this seem both charming and believable was the sense of love, forgiveness and a hopeful confidence that the journey they embark on will come true, that sense of hope is at the heart of it all. A sense of believing in all those seemingly trite sayings that still seem to hold a ring of truth. Most of the characters in this, and there are many, seem imbued with that old school confidence and quirky charm, although there are exceptions. In order to appreciate the goodness of life, and protect it, we have to remember that there are others who would steal it, given the chance.      22 book reviews: After his father 's demise, Emmett Watson is driven home by the Warden after 15 months in a juvenile detention work farm. He decides to leave Nebraska and drive to California with his younger brother Billy for a fresh start. Billy dreams of traveling the transcontinental Lincoln Highway as their mother had when she left them when they were younger. Old postcards sent in the course of her travels give Billy an idea of where she might be and he tries to convince his brother to follow the same route. The appearance of two of Emmett 's friends Woolly and Duchess, who stowed away in the trunk of the Warden 's car, results in a change of plans.  Emmett and Billy end up having to travel to New York after Duchess 'borrows' Emmett 's car leaving them stranded in Lewis, Nebraska after a visit to an orphanage where Duchess 's father had left him for some years before coming to collect him again. Sally, a family friend of Emmett and Billy, eventually joins them in New York.  Through multiple POVs Amor Towles takes us on a journey - not just on a road trip in the 1950s but on an exploration of these different characters , Emmett, Billy and, Woolly, Duchess and Sally - their stories and aspirations, their strengths and their flaws. The internal dialogue of each of these characters is extremely well written. The bond between Emmett and Billy is heartwarming. Emmett is a level headed young man who is trying to do his best for himself and his brother. He has learned from his past mistakes and genuinely looks forward to a better future. Billy, a child who seems wiser than his years with his big red book on heroes, is endearing in that he sees the best in everyone around him. He is a smart child, but unassuming and trusting(not quite discerning between an 'acquaintance' and a 'friend') and how his perspectives are broadened over the course of ten days is beautifully laid out for the reader to see. Duchess, at times, is the street smart one who knows how to fend for himself but at times is as vulnerable as can be and whose take on balancing his rights and wrongs may seem foolhardy and cause friction but the author gives so much dimension to his character that even though you might not like him at times you still want him to get a happy ending. Woolly comes from a privileged background but is all heart. He is quiet and introspective but takes joy in sharing stories with Billy. He revels in adventure and novel experiences with his friends. Sally is depicted as a willful young woman and a true friend to Emmett and Billy.  You feel so invested in these characters and the people they meet over the course of the ten days, that till the very last page and beyond you wonder where their adventures will take them. With its memorable characters and brilliant storytelling The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles is hard to put down!  23 book reviews: I was hooked on this tale of adventure featuring two brothers, Emmett, just out of a prison/work camp, and Billy, his younger brother. Immediately I was endeared to each of them, and then the story widens with other narrators who are part, or become part, of Emmett and Billy s world as they travel the country.  That s another thing I loved- the adventure story within this novel. It takes place across just ten days and goes in directions I never expected. The layering of the two main characters  lives is complex and provides a deep understanding of their feelings and perspectives. I m an emotional reader, and for 95% of this book, I was completely invested and could not imagine loving the story more.  The last 5% lost me a little, and for personal reasons, one of the happenings and how it was portrayed did not suit me. I can t tell you why without risking a spoiler, but I found it insensitive. I also would have liked to have learned more about Sally and why she was part of the story. Ulysses, too. More closure and follow-up with them would have added to the story for me, but I know; it was already a longer book.  All that said, revisiting the fact that I m an emotional reader, due to my investment in these characters and the vast majority of the book, my overall feeling is that I enjoyed it even if there are things I would tweak about the ending. I read this pretty fast, especially for a chunk, and I think that may be the way to go if you can carve out the time. The quick chapters and pacing keep the plot moving exceptionally well. Now to visit Towles  other two books! I can t wait!  I received a gifted copy and also bought a copy.  Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: and instagram:  24 book reviews: This is another beautiful and well-written tale by Amor Towles, almost as heart-warming and addictive as A Gentleman in Moscow. I loved each of the characters, their story arcs, the intersections, the bit players, the Shakespearean and Homeric references, the nostalgic atmosphere. I loved the moral lesson about too much of a particular virtue can become a disservice and even occasionally a vice that was poignantly demonstrated throughout.   What surprises the reader is that we are expecting things to move in a certain direction, but it turns out to be a road trip in the opposite direction than we expect. The US of the 50s is described with beautiful nostalgia and with many interesting anecdotes and diversions. Each of the characters is fully fleshed out and the dialogs are highly realistic. It has a light tone like Gentleman, but I think that the latter has even more charming characters than this one. It really is up to you, the reader to decide.                  (p. 282)           (p. 520)  Definitely up there as a 2022 Pulitzer contender in this reader s opinion!  25 book reviews: I was really looking forward to this one following the excellent  Gentleman in Moscow  but unfortunately it failed to grip me in the same way. Undoubtedly well written but I felt it generally dragged and failed to engage me. I have read many reviews that contradict my review but at the end of the day it is my personal opinion and nothing else.  In June 1954, eighteen year old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His father has recently died and his mother left a long time ago so the family farm is about to be taken over by the bank. Emmett plans to head for California to start a new life with his eight year old brother Billy. Once the warden drives off, Emmett discovers that two friends from the farm have stowed away in the warden s car and have very different plans regarding Emmett s future. Together the four travel in the opposite direction and head for New York.  Well written but too slow and unengaging.  I would like to thank both Net Galey and Random House for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.  26 book reviews: I know the year is still young but I won t be surprised this masterful novel will be my fave 2022 read. I finished it last night on audio   no wonder it was nominated for an Audie award - at midnight and had to wait until this morning to talk about the ending with my husband who was reading the print version (he finished it at 5:30 this morning having to also wait until I awoke at seven to talk about it).  This, friends, is the best book club kind of book. The kind of book whose prose is so beautiful and whose characters are so deeply drawn (Woolly!!  ) and where the reader s journey is so satisfying and multifaceted you just cannot wait to talk about it with someone when you re done.  It s the kind of book that I am sad I won t be able to ever read again for the first time.  I m strugglng to think of how to give you a brief synopsis of what it is about because somehow I think any attempt at that will spoil the read for you and that would be cruel. Suffice it to say that it is about a journey, as the title and cover art suggests, but not the journey you re expecting.  I am in awe of the talent that gave the world this story.  27 book reviews: What do I say about this book? It contains a little bit of everything; drama, comedy, irony, mythology, red herrings, mystery, throw in a little bit of magic, and a large and very wonderful cast of characters. The four main ones: Emmett, the dependable guy everyone can depend on. Duchess, a wild card capable of anything. Wooley, the wisest slow-witted fellow you have ever met. And 8 year old Billy, no words to describe how intelligent and intuitive and kind he was, and in my opinion, the originator of all the action in this novel. Then there were the special peripheral characters. Sally, Ulysses, Professor Abacus Abernathe and his Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers, and Other Intrepid Travelers, and many others too numerous to mention.  This is a road trip novel, and veers off into detours and side trips and takes us all over the place and into all sorts of situations. A lot of reviews complain about this fact and some readers give up entirely. All I can say is just put yourself in the capable hands of Amor Towles, ride along, and trust him to take you on a one-of-a-kind adventure. You will be glad you persevered.  28 book reviews: This book had a promising beginning when 18 year old Emmett Watson returns from serving time for involuntary manslaughter. His parents are dead and the family farm is lost, so Emmett and his 8 year old brother Billy decide to set off to California to start new lives. That promising beginning crashed and burned a few chapters later when Duchess and Woolly, 2 friends from the work farm, turned up to complicate Emmett s plans.  The book devolved into a picaresque tale without a single believable character. Everyone acted and sounded older than their age. Sally, the only significant female character, was added to the book for no reason that I could discern. The story changed point of view in each chapter so that each character, including a few who appeared only briefly, got to explain his or her story. It felt disjointed. The book was 300 pages too long. Maybe the author was aiming for a fable and he tacked on a serious ending, which I hated. I can t believe Towles wrote this. Very disappointing.  29 book reviews: I have taken a very long time to read this book, partly because it was the audio version and Christmas and family got in the way of listening time! Also I took a long while to attach to any of the characters and have to admit that I actively disliked Duchess to the point where I often had to turn the book off when he became too much for me!  So why have I ended up giving it four stars. Firstly it is because I love the way Towles writes and this carried me through the whole book. Secondly I grew to love Emmet and Billy and Woolly and Sally. (If I have any spellings wrong it is because I listened to the book and have not seen them in print).  Lastly it was the way the story finally wound up to that perfect ending. It was very sad, a little brutal, but realistic. All the ends were tied up and the people I had grown to love the most seemed assured of a happy future.  Not my favourite of this author 's books but still a very worthwhile read.  ",
    " The Love Hypothesis": "book reviews: I want to say this is a case of  It s not the book, it s me.  But then again, isn t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?  The Love Hypothesis follows Olive, a PhD student who wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.  Olive is a woman in STEM, but that is really all she is. I admit, I loved this representation, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she s not American (she s Canadian), she s not male, and she s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in. Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.  Other than that, there was nothing.  One part of the problem is Adam himself. Adam felt very, very It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially from Olive. I usually like fictional men like him, even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new, but this case didn t work for me.  Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5 8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive s mind (since it s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. The whole book, we don t really know what Olive looks like or what she likes, and all we know about Adam is that he is a who hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. Oh, and we can t forget that he s big, especially when you re reminded every fucking page.    Speaking of, Olive s personality also felt a little childish sometimes. It made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date. Olive s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.    Also, it s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum, specifically demisexuality. It s briefly mentioned in the beginning (even the term is used) and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam, For starters, I literally got second-hand embarrassment, and second, I can t help but wish it was was expanded more on. It was as if the author just wanted to add more to Olives lacking personality so she sprinkled some pretty damn humiliating ace representation.    Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating. Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student 's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the first kiss, feeling the comfort of the other s touch, realizing you re falling for for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced that I wondered how the two would develop feelings. They were also in moments where they had been  dating  for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they were not friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole  We are dating, so we need people to see us  scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they re fake dating.  While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn t understand how or why Adam liked Olive. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn t anything to appreciate.  Olive first had a crush on Adam, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into  I love him  mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue.  We do not talk about it.  I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn t laugh at anything. Well, I did laugh at the stupidity of this book.  The side characters also felt too immature for me, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) were ridiculous and could have been solved easily if they literally just talked like the  adults  they were.  Overall, had zero appreciation from me. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull.   1 book reviews: Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTok   Update: I made a TikTok about this book! https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8F6eLXf/    Previous review: Why does that look like Kylo Ren and Rey wearing lab coats tho    I have a reputation for being a harsh reviewer, but honestly-- I am just immune to hype. If I like a book, I like a book, whether it 's popular or not. Usually, I find myself not liking hyped books, so I tend to avoid them, but as someone who works in STEM and did lab research, something about the premise of this book was constantly beckoning me. I NEEDED it.    Now that I have read the book, I have some thoughts.                          2 book reviews: idk what kind of drugs y all are on but i evidently did not receive my portion   maybe manvi is right and i just really hate popular books but, this was just  not good?   the pure of having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about it  i actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he s not happy.   this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.  also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of  raising  good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of  buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him . first of all, have you considered that you re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict.   there s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man s physical attributes and if it s not the eyes it s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big. HUGE. ENORMOUS. A FUCKING GIANT. HE HAS MUSCLES. I GET IT!!!!!! HIS FINGERS ARE MASSIVE AND SO IS HIS DICK. GREAT. you didn t have to tell me in every paragraph though. i know i have shit memory but i am not close to dementia yet. once or twice would have been enough. like what do you want me to do? shall i applaud him? good job growing, i guess you ate your carrots as a kid, go you!   have i mentioned that this book could have been 350 pages shorter if they had just talked to each other? communication, so important.   this book started every chapter with a hypothesis except that most of them weren t actually hopotheses but who cares. who cares. wait  my test theory prof is calling and i think he does.  other than that, the science was actually the best part of the book. also the criticism of the bad working conditions of phd students was very well done. i m only a master s student but a phd might be in my future plans and i can already feel the poverty, so #relatable.   there were only two chapters i liked: chapter 16 and chapter 20.  chapter 16 is the sex chapter and in chapter 20 a certain character gets called out on their behaviour and adam does this sexy thing of nearly beating them up.  having read another review that has quoted chapter 16 though  ugh  cringe. idk what i was on reading this. in my defense i haven t seen my boyfriend in a week so maybe i was feeling touch starved. also, there 's this very fine line between finding your partner so sexy that you ca not control yourself and premature ejaculation. i am not saying that adam belongs in the second category. but i am.  i still stand by my opinion that chapter 20 was sexy.   i did actually like adam even though he s a very stereotypical grumpy-only-drinks-black-coffee-and-eats-broccoli kind of character. he is definitely kinda bland. but maybe i just like my men bland *shrugs*. i have like zero opinions on olive though. she was there i guess.   all in all: i don t think this book has done anything new or swoon worthy. the characters were average. the story was average. the writing was average. i don t really get why everyone is so crazy about it. i guess the STEM aspect was fun but even that has been done before i think?  overall, i was mainly bored and infuriated by the amount of unnecessary drama and height descriptions. you all do you i guess. but i ll do me: 1.5 stars  3 book reviews: once upon a time, i read this book, and despite the fact that i have a heart of darkness (sorry joseph conrad) and am full of hate and vitriol (makes me a fun gossip though) and eat romance novels for breakfast (as in am very picky about them - i am actually not a big breakfast eater)...  i enjoyed it.  and then i read everything else that this author has ever written, and i hated all of it.  and when to came time to revisit...  well, welcome to judgment day.  i hated this too.  maybe most of all.  (well, almost most of all. a love interest putting our protagonist 's entire boob in his mouth is still not quite as terrifying and unsexy and jail-worthy as , a real thing that happens multiple times in an actual ali hazelwood novella.)  i am an adult woman. i am tall. my hair is a normal, non-neon or -pastel color. i own zero pairs of knee-high socks with lisa frank prints on them, i am capable of feeding myself, and i do not live my life between instances of awe-inspiring misogyny from men that only other men can rescue me from.  this is a relatively typical list of traits, i think, and yet these details completely prevent me from enjoying even a moment of any given ali hazelwood I-Big-You-Small-Let 's-Spend-40-Pages-Talking-About-How-I-Ca not-Fit-Inside-You \"romance.\"  c'est la vie.  bottom line: i officially give up on sunshine, rainbows, love, and happiness. and also this author.  ---------------------                            ---------------   science nerds fake dating!!!!!!!!!!!  4 book reviews: Ah, scientists in love! Be still, my heart!  Olive is a third year Ph.D. candidate, filling her pipettes and titrating like a boss, when she somehow manages to land herself in a fake relationship with the ever glowering Dr. Adam Carlsen. She really ca not believe her bad luck. Unfortunately, she has spun her lies, so she has no choice but to see them through. But the more time they spend together, the more Olive starts to realize he might just be the one she 's been looking for all along.  This was just a hoot and a half! A lot of romcoms manage to get the romantic part exactly right, but hits the comedy bit out of the park too. Olive 's dialogues are witty and snarky, and she pretty much cracked me up from beginning to end. I could not stop giggling and snorting, even while reading in public, which definitely got me some weird looks from strangers.  I absolutely loved that Ali Hazelwood chose a woman in STEM as her main character and highlighted the difficulties they encounter as part of this story. As a woman in STEM myself, it warms my heart to see someone like me take center stage in a romance. A lot of what Olive went through, including how intimidating it is to be in a field surrounded by men and how unsure she is of her worth and her ability, I understand intimately.  The romance between Olive and Adam developed slowly, with plenty of tension and sizzle. The premise to set up the trope of fake dating was a little silly, but once you get past that, the rest is nothing short of sweet and satisfying. Adam is reticent in the beginning, but he soon thaws and warms up to Olive 's relentless cheer and good-natured teasing. His support of her in their shared field is particularly touching and it made me root even harder for this couple.  With romances, there 's always the question of whether it contains explicit, open-door scenes. And whichever way the book chooses to go, it inevitably alienates half of the readership who wants it the other way. That 's why I was particularly fond of the way it was handled in this book. All those scenes are in one contiguous chunk (spread across two chapters), so it 's easy to skip if that 's not your thing and you can still enjoy the rest of the story without having to worry about missing anything crucial.  This story totally checks all the boxes for me. It 's sweet, smart, and uproariously funny, and it touched my heart and my mind. No doubt about it, anything Ali Hazelwood writes from now on will be devoured by me posthaste.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~    The STEMinist Novellas   ~~~~~~~~~~~~   5 book reviews: OMG! Look at the cover reminds us Reylo (Kylo and Rey disguised in lab coats, kissing each other till they get breathless), two nerdy adorable characters who were pretending as couple: a rigid-a.hole but also charismatic 34 years old professor and sweet, quirky, gold hearted Phd student who tries to find the cure of pancreatic cancer! I m sold!!!  Banters are nerdish, sexy, entertaining but I have to scream at hot professor Adam s face at each time he calls Olive smart ass! I wish he may have called her something smarter, catchy, more affectionate maybe?  Olive Smith is an orphan, insecure, hard working, smart biologist spending the most of her time in the lab for her research and emailing colleges for funding to work on the cure of cancer with brand new method.  After losing her loved ones at young age she becomes insecure about relationships. She is happy with her research, spending time with her close friends. There s nothing she cannot sacrifice for them.  As soon as she breaks up with her boyfriend she doesn t even like, she realizes her bestie Anh likes her ex way too much. To prove a point that she already moved on her life, she decides to kiss the first guy passing through the corridor while Anh is watching so she can believe in her and date with her ex.  The plan was simple till the guy she randomly kissed turns out Adam Carlsen, a young, hotshot lab tyrant most of the students curse the day they met.  But interestingly he doesn t get furious about her love triangle tantrum. Actually he agrees to pretend acting like lovers for his own reasons to get enough fund to finance his own researches. Both of the parties seem like benefit from this arrangement till Olive realizes she likes way too much their Wednesday coffee dates and don t forget the fact that she keeps drooling over his six packs. Even though he s named as professor from hell, he always treats her sweet, respectful and he seems like he also enjoys to spend time with her.  But Olive has to wear big girl pants to face with her true feelings even though her love is unrequited. Could she be brave enough to come clean with him? What if she has to risk at more than broken heart?  Overall: I loved nerdish heroes and their gibberish scientific sweet talks! I enjoyed their chemistry!  #metoomovement , emotional and physical abuse themes were sensitively added into equation.  Holden and Malcolm were my favorite supporting characters.  I loved the academic romcom premise!  I went back and forth between four and five sisters but finally I rounded up 4.5 stars to 5 because of my love for MCs. Especially Adam earned millions of brownie points after the final revelations. He s sweetest kind of douchebag!  This book made me feel so good and put a long and wide smile on my face, made my entire week.  Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this digital copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.  6 book reviews: The Love Hypothesis is the kind of book that I think is better for newbie romance readers. For me, with thousands of romance books under my belt, it became painful to read by the end.  I started out reading The Love Hypothesis feeling giddy and elated. I *adored* the geeky, surly professor and poor grad student dynamic, and the narration by was . I was 100000% sure that I was going to love this book, and I started recommending it to everyone. But slowly, slowly, things starting creeping in.  I will be the first to admit that is an impressive debut from . I am impossibly excited to read her future work, but I dearly hope she changes a few things about how she crafts romance books for her second novel.  With such a skilled narrator and such a great start to the book, you would think I would be riveted to the story, but by the end I had to speed up the narration a ton just to force myself to finish. I wanted to smack both characters in the head. Repeatedly.  It is a huge pet peeve of mine when authors rely on miscommunications for the whole tension and plot of a book, and by 50% of the way in, it became abundantly clear that this is what we were facing. I was pretty upset that what had seemed so promising took such a sideways turn.  Look, maybe you will love this book and eat up every morsel, but I was actually angry by the end of this book. Your mileage may vary with this one.  |||  7 book reviews: it gave what it was supposed to give and 10x more! this shit is a literary masterpiece! flawless! perfection! excellent! splendid! and above all epic   these characters have bewitched me body, mind, soul! these bad bitch scientists had me acting all submissive and breedable    Olive- pumpkin spice loving bad bitch was so inspiring and all around an enjoyable MC to read about. this book proves ANYONE (especially nerdy girls like me and olive) can girl boss, gate-keep, and gaslight!! she s a bad bitch that deserves the world !!! but i m also jealous of her because she has Adam !? like um sharing is caring #SelfishScientist  anyways   Adam- this mfing dadddddy! had me screaming, clutching my pearls, and aggressively ripping my shirt off! i fucking love this strong, needle phobic, 6 foot something KING!! he s a fucking thot y all! don t even fight me on this. he had my legs fucking divorced in chapter 16; his pov and Olive s  the plot and writing were excellent! yes this is fiction but it s written so realistically ya know? it ain t fabricated. the emotions were raw. my heart was swelling for these characters. bruv why did i read this so MFing fast?!?! i don t want it to be over.  overall this book had me trembling, gasping for oxygen, sweating through my hairline, weak in the MFing knees, and pinned down to the ground.  i had so much fun reading this. it had my attention from cover to cover! ain t no one doing it out here like queen Ali Hazelwood!! Ali deserves the world for birthing this. She fucking DELIVERED   she deserves to get her kitty cat meow meow eaten out from the front to the back, up & down, side to side, in & around!! she deserves the world!!  this is yet another book that hit me from the back, ate me out, and gave me a kiss on the forehead. let s gooooooo    8 book reviews: **Spoiler Alert**  The best part about this story is the focus on women in STEM everything else is a blurry, one-dimensional mess that left me with way too many questions.  1. What if Olive had not fake kissed Adam? Would he have continued to wait even more years before engaging with her?  Olive kissing a random guy instead of properly communicating with her supposed 'best friend' is outlandish. Their motivation for keeping up the lies (and yes, they were both lying) was unconvincing.  How did Olive go (within a span of 2 hours) from being a victim of sexual assault to joking about bad sushi and inconsequential things. That scene could have been so powerful yet it was poorly handled by Hazelwood.  Anh, the 'best friend', is such a cliche character. Ugh  Hazelwood threw in asexuality to tick a box, not because she wanted to actually write an asexual character. Olive trying to explain her sexuality while Adam was going down on her was one of the funniest non-funny scenes I have ever read. Like, girl, stfu.  Finally, what exactly does Olive look like??!!! I knew she was 5'8\" and skinny. For that matter, I know more about Adam 's henleys and plaid shirts than I do him.   9 book reviews: It is IMPOSSIBLE and downright HORRIBLE for this book to get anything under a 5 star rating    ITS SOOOO FUCKING GOOD and I m in such a hangover now i literally do not know what to do with myself.  Start to finish HOLY SHIT. You re hook line and sinker baby.  Not one dry page here.  Adam is one of the MOST WHOLESOME CHARACTERS IVE EVER READ Jesus Christ I m so in love with this man. And OLIVE?!? My dedication to these two is downright unhealthy.  I ll ride hard for this book forever. It goes down as one of my top reads this year.  SOOOO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK.  The banter. The SPICE. Wait on chapter 16 JUST WAIT ON IT!!! The friendships. ADAM BEING SCARED OF NEEDLES. Olive wrangling out an ice cream sandwich from him. HIM LETTING HER!!  WOMEN. IN. SCIENCE.  I was a weeee bit scared that the science talk would confuse me because science is definitely not my strongest subject but easy peasy.  I m just obsessed. Rightfully so.  This book is phenomenal and I REALLY REALLY need an Adam POV.  That epilogue was amazing. The layout of the book is amazing.  I m thrilled about this. Holy crap. What else can I say to convince you . absolutely top notch.  10 book reviews: Re-read 10/12/21: Reached that point of fall when all I want to do is re-read my favorite romances and I am so!!!! happy to report that this one has joined the ranks. Adam and Olive are perfect I will be accepting zero (0) criticism at this time  Original read 7/1/21: I went into this one on a complete whim bc I needed an e-book to read on my nightly walk, and it ended up absolutely blowing me away. Everything about this was honestly perfect. The writing, the characters, the chemistry (literal and figurative lol), THE SMUT. This was SO hot, but also SO cute and SO funny and I just loved absolutely every second spent in between these pages. I did not know who Ali Hazelwood was before going into this, but I will now be anxiously awaiting every book she will ever publish because this was JUST SO GOOD YOU ALL NEED TO READ IT / ADD IT TO YOUR TBRS IMMEDIATELY! My heart!!!!!!!  CW: terminal illness (pancreatic cancer), death of a loved one, sexual harassment  11 book reviews: Hypothesis: Maybe I really am just a lonely bitch who only finds happiness in seeing fictional couples get their HEA? And that 's okay? Just kidding lol, but also definitely not?  I genuinely did not think that I was going to enjoy this book as much as I did, especially with the obscene amount of hype it has received all over the internet....but DAMN was I wrong. The Love Hypothesis melted my stone cold heart and made me experience every single human emotion possible in 385 pages, so intensely that I have very few words to say about it that can be typed without keyboard smashing.  If you need me, I will be busy sitting in the corner physically restraining myself from rereading this book & weeping over the fact that fictional love is fictional (asjkfgsdjakls).  12 book reviews: for a book about science there was some dubious physics at play (see: hero fitting heroine s entire boob in mouth)  this was cute though. heroine did irritate me at times but i m a curmudgeon when it comes to quirky heroines. she did stand up for herself in the end though and despite the aforementioned whole boob snafu, the sex was   13 book reviews: I don t think reylos deserve human rights sorry 14 book reviews: In the words of Adam Driver .  Good soup    4.5  15 book reviews: Lesson I learned was to never trust booktok ever again. 16 book reviews: if you want happiness: read this book  17 book reviews: did i devour this book or did this book devour me? 18 book reviews: the rumours are, in fact, trumours.  this book really is as adorable as everyone is saying. 19 book reviews: Oficialmente en mi TOP 5 libros de romance favoritos. Ahora le rezo (y le lloro) a Adam Carlsen.  No le pongo rating porque es sorpresa para cuando haga el video. 20 book reviews:   4.5 stars  I heard this book started out as a Wattpad story and people were not impressed with the writing, but honestly I would take that as a back-handed compliment. Have you read the right Wattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I do not take criticism. And no, I am not talking about After either    The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I could not outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.  I have read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!! Olive and Adam 's meet-cute already had me on a chokehold.        Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I did not mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:    age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)   sunshine-grumpy   fake-dating   slow-burn   workplace romance   Ph.D student x professor (but it 's not forbidden)   mutual pining   friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers   one-bed trope (kinda)   Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is ca not talk for a second   guy simping for the girl first   dimples   asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl   endless banter and teasing       I will spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else         Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam 's hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte).     Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He 's super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive 's #1 fan.  Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive 's frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work.  Olive 's smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she 's a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee   the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch      The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it   Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine does not know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I'M SCREaMINg   When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out   When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I am on my knees for my consent king    Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou                 Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I am going to love this girl. Not biased or anything. Anh was a queen anyway and it was not hard to stan her     Find yourself a best friend who would marry you if she thinks you will get deported back to Canada and need a green card.   You do not understand how much I love Anh. She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot).  My love for her already started that she did not want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it 's for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she 's over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair   Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam   Olive kissing Adam  ) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I would love to see it.         The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden 's friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam 's back.           Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive 's feeling for Adam even tho he did not like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo.       Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that 's how much I loved Olive and Adam 's first meeting   But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me.  I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy 's pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the \"amazing girl\" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like   guys I thought you were SMART    And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance does not have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his \"I love you\" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that was not all that satisfying either..       Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1) Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2) Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3) Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3) No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I have read this year.    P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I will always remember that. I will go into the exam with that mentality, I am suing if I am still going to fail    21 book reviews: *sigh* when is it my turn to be happy? 22 book reviews: I am blocking everyone who said this was good on booktok. 23 book reviews: Olive plants a giant kiss on a random person in the hallway. Her friend, Anh, has a crush on a guy that Olive went out with one time, and she wants to convince Anh that she is free to go after her one-date wonder. However, the random guy in the hallway turns out to be a world famous scientist and a very grumpy, mean one at that. He is the famous Adam Carlsen. Will Olive and Adam be able to convince everyone that they are a couple? Will they discover any real feelings? Plus, Olive is about to graduate....  As far as romance novels go, this one was pretty sweet and funny. It was also a quick read. Although I do wish that Adam was not always described as essentially an underwear model. Is not it enough just to be ridiculously smart with a decent job? Do you have to have six-pack abs too? Setting expectations a little high? This might have alienated some readers but if Adam and Olive are both scientists, why do not they have more scientific discussions? I am not a very scientific person, but I would assume that it would be like two literary buffs quoting book phrases to each other.  Overall, this was an enjoyable book with some quality plot development.

Aqu  nos encontramos con Olive, una cient fica que est  intentando encontrar fondos para su investigaci n sobre un tipo de c ncer y, al mismo tiempo, est  tratando de que su mejor amiga se anime a salir con un chico que le encanta, pero que resulta que es su ex. Para impulsarla, Olive decide que su amiga debe verla feliz con un hombre, pero el problema es que su vida amorosa est  m s desolada que el desierto del Sahara. Sin embargo, un d a, en un impulso y aprovechando que su amiga la est  viendo, Olive se lanza a besar a uno de los profesores del departamento  que resulta ser nada m s y nada menos que Adam Carlsen, a quien b sicamente todo el mundo teme porque es fr o y despiadado con los estudiantes. La cosa es que, contra todo pron stico, Olive y Adam terminan entrando en un acuerdo de , cada uno con sus propios motivos, pero todos sabemos c mo acaba esto.  Si me conocen, saben que a veces suelo ser supremamente impaciente con los libros que tienen romances   y es la definici n de eso. Sin embargo, les juro que no hab a disfrutado tant simo un libro en mucho tiempo. Toda la historia de Olive y Adam, la tensi n que se fue desarrollando con cada encuentro inc modo, con cada situaci n loca en la que se met an, con cada malentendido, con cada escena en la que se notaba que ambos ten an un poco oxidados sus capacidades de relacionarse con otros seres humanos, con cada peque a sonrisa que Olive le sacaba a Adam, con los chistes internos que empezaron a aparecer, con las miradas, con la angustia, con el miedo de estar enamor ndose del otro y quiz s no ser correspondido  wow, todo eso fue como una flecha que se me iba clavando cada vez m s hondo en el coraz n, que me recordaba eternamente mi desgraciada solter a y que me hac a quererlos a ellos cada vez m s. Es absolutamente demente lo mucho que uno puede llegar a involucrarse emocionalmente con dos personas que ni siquiera existen. Pero esa es la magia de los libros, supongo.  Y s , hubo momentos frustrantes en los que quer a golpearlos a los dos y encerrarlos en una habitaci n para que dejaran de pensar cosas idiotas y, por fin, aceptaran que estaban locos el uno por el otro  En serio, hay momentos en los que me sacaban de quicio. Pero al mismo tiempo todo era hermoso y parte de sus procesos. Sobre todo con respecto a Olive. Y me gustar a much simo hablar de un aspecto de ella con el que me identifiqu  a niveles estratosf ricos, pero eso ser a un , as  que dejar  que lo descubran ustedes cuando lean el libro.   Y el final?  Qu  puedo decirles? Esos  ltimos cap tulos son perfectos, incre bles, , llenos de sentimientos, de m s malentendidos, de momentos  picos y, sobre todo, de much sima, much sima felicidad. No les puedo decir mucho m s, pero sepan que es uno de esos libros que, aunque te pueden frustrar por momentos y que pueden tener escenas tristes, siempre van a quedar como un de felicidad en tu memoria.  26 book reviews: someone forgot to take the wattpad out of this book   27 book reviews: edit: 1 star.  The reason? Oh, well, I did not enjoy this book whenever I think of it. And it makes me anxious to think that I rated it with 3 stars, lmao... After this, I might be able to rest in peace, knowing that I rated as I thought when I first finished it. Straight to \"big hype, big lie\" shelf. :D      Buckle up, bitches, there are some spoilers ahead!  I honestly have not read a lot books with \"miss sunshine and mister grumpy\" trope, but I kind of know how the thing goes, so yikes.  For what I know, this book was a Reylo fanfic, so picturing Adam as Adam Driver was not complicated. But it made it hard for me because. . . Idk, it 's not that I think he 's ugly, but I do not think either that he 's sexy. If you find him attractive and that stuff, then you know your reasons.  I have seen a LOT  y'all know that I do not lie with this  of hype for this book. *looks at booktok, booktwt, bookstagram* So, I had to give it a try. . . Every single day appears on my feed at least 6 times in a row friends' updates of this book, so, I thought \"this book must be good\".  Anyhow, I do not actually know how to feel about this book. . . It was. . . weird? Sweet? Awkward? Immature?  Idk, you name it.  I am fan of nerd and smart people who are not smug, arrogant and assholes. Actually, there 's more probability that I fall in love with some nerd (I am not straight, so, lol) like Adam or Olive than for someone like Tom (he was hot, but he was such a fucking dick).  I had expectations from this book because lately \"great\" and overhyped books tend to disappoint me to the point of not wanting to have high hopes (do not start with the \"then why do you read them?\" because I am not a nice person when it comes to insult people, lmao) aND YET, HERE I AM, WRITING THE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.  I need to check up on my life choices. . . Which makes me go to the thing that drove me mad in this book: eVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME OLIVE WAS LIKE \"YES, THIS IS MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY DECISIONS\", YES, SIS, WE GET IT. YOU'VE MADE SOME SILLY AND POOR DECISIONS, BUT BUCKLE UP, AND MOVE THE FUCK ON.  Also, I was so fucking tired of the Yes, we get it, white men are mediocre. Most of them are. I just do not know why, but that phrase pissed me off.  Chapter 16 was so hyped. Bitch, no. It was awkward and it seemed very very very forced. It is mentioned (briefly, but there it is) that Olive might be asexual, which is fine and I do not judge that because I am ace and I totally get how it feels. Nevertheless, I did think that was forced: perceived her uncomfortable doing that, despite the fact that she agreed. I honestly do not know how sex works, lol. Totally unnecessary. I get the hype for some things, but not for chapter 16. It was not spicy in any single way. It made me feel uncomfortable and I was cringing every 10 seconds. I thought that something good was gonna happen, and I was left with empty hands because I received nothing from that chapter.  Idk why, but Olive seemed VERY immature and Adam was flat? Yes, Mr. Grumpy and-I-hate-everything-black-is-my-color-because-black-is-my-soul-and-I-make-my-grades-cry. I get the trope, I really do, but give him some personality???  Adam it 's perceived as someone complicated and who loves their own personal space (again, I do not judge because I enjoy my own personal space as no one) and Olive describes him as \"antagonic and unapproachable\" aLL THE TIME. If people told me that, I would take it as a joke, but deep down that shit hurts, even as a joke or random comment, but, yeah, us, grumpy people, are like that. I get that Adam is huge, that have big ass hands, big body, big shoulders and big dick. wE GET IT. Just please stop repeating it every damn time the damn man appears.  Sometimes, I disliked Anh. I did not know if she was around 26 or 15. She basically forced Olive to do things that obviously she did not wanna do, despite the fact that Anh thought that Olive and Adam were dating and she did not know the whole truth. She was very flat and at the very end we did not have a lot of her.  After the big disappointing that chapter 16 turned out to be, I was even more disappointed than ever. I mean, as I said: I had very little  if none at this point  expectations, but chapter 16 made it go from 0.01 to -00000000000000000000 in a span of 5 minutes, and I did not wanna read anymore.  When Adam said, and I quote: I lost my shit. I was fucking melting and no, I am not ashamed of it, lol.  The romance was okay I guess??? I do not know why, but I expected more. Please do not ask me why, because even I do not know the answer to that... Perhaps it was all of the hype on booktok and bookstagram, but it was a flop to me, lmao.  Overall I guess it was fine? Idk dude, writing this review made me realize that I did not like this book as much as I wanted.  Tho I would fake-date / fake-marry someone to get out of Latin America (third world country issues, lol) and get the citizenship in another country, perhaps Europe or Canada? Idk, love can come with time, lol.  Tom was an asshole and I wish Adam would have punch him in the face :)  In overall, as I did not enjoy a lot of romance (or think that actually was romantic, cute and that stuff) makes me think that I am a heartless and cold bitch who ca not feel a single thing or will never fall in love. bUT I'M ALSO A HOPELESS ROMANTIC. I NEED HELP.   The only way I am gonna live a rom-com story is gonna be when I fake-date or fake-marry someone to get mi citizenship in another country  28 book reviews:  I have never been surer of anything. Except maybe cell theory.   the love hypothesis is the best romance i have read in years. it 's smart, funny, and oh so swoon worthy! and it was truly one of those books that reminded me why i love reading. i fell in love with both olive and adam so quickly, but i also found this to be one of the most believable fake dating romances, too. from the very first page, i was absolutely hooked and only felt more and more endeared throughout! (and even more late into the night when i desperately was so i could unhingedly get an adam pov bonus chapter!)  this book deals with some heavy themes at times, so please use caution and i will list some warnings below. i personally felt like the author does a thoughtful and important job at highlight what women of stem can face in many lab settings, while also always shining light on how much more noninclusive (and scary) that it can be for bipoc women and nonbinary people of stem. (the author note at the end with some resources was really amazing, too)  i just appreciated so much of this book and this author 's words. this story was a little niche to me and my personal life, so i think that also helped me fall in love! (i am not sure if i can blame it on why i was giggling a sickening amount into my pillow - but i will pretend!) and i also want to note, that the word is never on page, but there was some demi rep in this story that i found very relatable and it meant a whole lot to me too.  (if you would like to learn more about pancreatic cancer research !)  talk of cancer, loss of a parent in the past, talk of fear of needles, and sexual harassment, abuse of power, + bullying in work/college settings.  | | | | |           29 book reviews: \"Ik hou van jou, Adam.\" That pretty much sums up my thoughts on this book   The hype is justified. This was such a PERFECT book. I am so in love with it. Damn, why did I not read this sooner   Although I gotta say that epilogue was totally rushed. Oliva and Adam make such a cute couple. I will fight to protect them. I was for real giggling, blushing, smiling, jumping and laughing throughout my read.  To those who have not yet read this- DO READ! You are missing out on something so beautiful and exceptional. Highly recommend!!  ",
    " The Maid: A Novel": "book reviews: I was initially really excited about this title because I love historical fiction and can still remember an episode of Wishbone dealing with Joan of Arc. (Please tell me there is at least one person who remembers Wishbone, the cute little dog that imagines himself the main character in classic literature? I got a Jack Russell because of Wishbone.)  However, once I started this title, it became very apparent that it wasn t for me. There were several instances of child abuse and even a moment where Joan (who is called Jeanne in the novel) punches another child because they pick on her for being too religious. That made no sense to me, yes she had visions but historically speaking, the inhabitants of the villages in this time would be just as religious as Jeanne.  I also thought that there was too much sexual content. I think it was a misplaced attempt to put emphasis on the fact that she was supposed to be virginal. In every chapter there seemed to be a man who wanted to sleep with her; leading her to have another monologue as to how important it was that she remains chaste. The sexual content became distracting.  I could not get past the personality of Jeanne either. I was expecting her to be somewhat reserved, perhaps meek, yet still able to lead. Yet she came across as mean, bossy and self-righteous; the latter not being a compliment. I started this novel expecting to feel inspired by this character, when in actuality I was more so tempted to punch her. She expected everyone to listen to her (Yes, I know, she was hearing the voices of God and several Saints) but she didn t extend that same courtesy to anyone else. Anyone who showed any hesitation to what she wanted, she treated like an idiot and an enemy.  I wish I had more enthusiasm for this title, as I am a historical fiction freak and because I was really excited to read this one, but I don t. There were too many things that I didn t like about this title for me to really like the book. I do think that there will definitely be an audience for this book. Sadly, I am not the one of them.  1 book reviews: A simple peasant girl is born during the Hundred Year 's War in Domremy in 1412. She learns how to read and write only one word - her first name - Jehanne. Her sister gets murdered by the English. She escapes both an abusive father and a forced marriage.  At the age of sixteen, she starts having visions of saving France from English invasions. Her visions are very clear, she needs to get to Chinon before mid-Lent in order to save France. It 's not an easy task for a peasant girl to get to the King. She prays vigorously to receive help.  With the received help, she meets the `King' who at the time is Dauphin and later thanks to her gets crowned as king. While the `King' makes his decision, she learns how to horse ride, joust, swordplay and studies attack strategies.  The decision is made and Joan of Arc leads her men. One fight after another is successful until the first arrow pierces her back. Maybe this is the first sign of her losing her powers. The scene of her getting out the arrow is so vivid that it is painful to read it.  At the end, she gets captured due to the lack of support from the King. Her own people betray her, most of all - the King who does not pay her ransom. She receives unfair trial. She gets a second chance, but her choice is very clear. As we all know, at the very end she gets burned at the stake in Rouen.  My only problem with this story is the foul language. Otherwise, this is a very engrossing story, which I honestly was not expecting.  2 book reviews: A poetic retelling of one of the most fascinating women in European history. Cutter fluently combines fact and legend to create an enjoyable read, both educational and entertaining. 3 book reviews: I went into The Maid knowing the Jehanne d Arc story mostly from high school history class   and Luc Besson s movie, The Messenger. I assumed this book would be a guilty pleasure   not necessarily something I d want to read again, but fun, and hopefully only mildly irritating in its anachronism. After all, it s hard to find a novel about a great woman in history that doesn t insert modern sensibilities into the character s mind, so I was bracing myself for a feminist re-write that down played Joan s faith.  But then I read the first page. The first thing that struck me is that Cutter takes Jehanne s faith very, very seriously. And not only that, but she gives you a taste of it   her language is most inventive and fresh when she s writing about Jehanne s experience of God and the saints and angel that visit her.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about The Maid is that it s almost all completely true. Her predictions of the tide of battles, of one of her wounds, of the time of her own death; her jumping, unscathed, 50-70 feet from the tower where she was imprisoned by the Burgundians   it s all true.  Jehanne d Arc was   and is   an extremely compelling, mysterious character in history. There s still strong contention over whether she was carrying out a divine mission, or whether she was mentally (or physically) ill   whether she fought in battle with the French army, or was merely a standardbearer   whether she was raped in prison   how she managed to convince the dauphin and France to believe her and give her the means to complete her mission. As a Christian, I find her compelling and perplexing   with all the violence and nationalism integral to her story, she doesn t fit easily into my idea of what a Christian looks like, but I can t write her off as a lunatic.  Cutter s interpretation of Jehanne s character was similar to Luc Besson s movie -- the line between her divine mission and her often wrathful, prideful will is often unclear. But both sides are there   it is neither wholly one nor the other that drives her. This, together with Cutter s vivid interpretation of Jehanne s visions, makes for a character at once thrillingly unlike ourselves and yet still just as subject to the same human sins as any of us. We re also made to feel the poignancy of how Jehanne s apartness feels to her   to know that she will never be married to anyone but God, will never have children, and she is left to anticipate the time of her death; an apartness that, as Cutter notes in the book, perhaps only Christ shares. And there are many, many men   half a dozen, maybe   who remind her of her loneliness, and who she must keep at arm s length to remain true to her mission.  The book was a wonderful read, and I read it at a breakneck pace even as I knew the end   and her end   was coming. It was a hard read, though, too   it s a book about total war, and includes many, many vivid battle scenes that are hard to take, as well as crude (but believable) language. It also includes at least one psychopath, Gilles du Rais, whose particular violent perversions are not only nauseating but linger in the mind.  A nice touch was Saint Margaret calling Jehanne by the nickname  cabbage    which is, strangely enough, a real term of endearment in French ( chou-fleur ).  One thing that bothered me, though, was that while Jehanne is in every other way an orthodox (small  o ) Catholic, each mention of Christ appears without capitalized pronouns   God is He, Christ is he. This is extremely unusual and, for me, very distracting. This is perhaps the one solid criticism I can make, though, besides the difficulty with some language and violent scenes.  Cutter s book includes a brief factual note at the end, stating what things she interpreted, adapted, added or otherwise changed, as well as a list of books and authors whose work was helpful in writing The Maid   both of which are great resources that I m glad to have. I also appreciate how closely Cutter hewed to the facts   she gave us her view of Jehanne s character without spoiling the true story.  Ultimately, it was a thrilling book , and I plan to reread it. It has reignited my interest in Jehanne d Arc, and I m happy to have read it.  4 book reviews: 2.5 stars  Author Kimberly Cutter recounts the short life of Jeanne d'Arc (Jehanne here), The Maid of Orl ans and later canonized as Saint Joan of Arc. This is one of those too complicated bits of history to try to explain in a review, and Wik can most definitely do it better than I can.  Joan 's history is a fascinating one, and I have been eyeing novels on her for some time, so I was thrilled when this showed up on Net Galley. However, the book I read was very dry and the history itself is hard to follow - there seems to be an assumption the reader is well versed on the period. When I read a historical novel, I do so with the expectation that I will be educated and entertained at the same time, I do not expect to have to *read up* on the historical events before I begin the novel.  The chapters were very short for the most part and I found this distracted from the overall flow of the story. I also did not find any emotional connection with the characters, particularly Joan. I did not pick up on any grand passion nor religious fervor for her Godly mission. Overall, this was a dry and slightly disappointing read as it currently stands, but perhaps a bit of editing and fleshing out of characters can raise the bar a bit higher.  5 book reviews: There 's no reason on the surface for me to love \"The Maid\": I am not a huge fan of Joan of Arc, I am not a woman, I do not know a whole lot about the history of the period. But I think this is a novel that transcends all of the usual categories through the sheer power of its writing and the way it brings Jehanne, the illiterate peasant girl who changed history, to indelible life. The prose is clean, clear and lyrical in a way that you do not often see in historical fiction. It 's not larded down with faux-periodisms and fake Medieval diction that would only detract from its authority and power. This is an unforgettable novel about a heroine who refused the life that was open to her as a child bride and housemaid and, instead, led a rebellion against an occupying power. It 's a thrillingly good read, especially the battle scenes. This is also the rare novel that takes religious belief seriously (and deals with Jehanne 's visions brilliantly) without having a religious agenda itself.  6 book reviews: I was almost hesitant to read this book because of some of the bad reviews. I am confused as to those, because this was a great book! It 's about Joan of Arc, called Jehanne, from when she starts hearing voices till she 's executed. This is a sad story, but definitely leaves me wanting to research more about this remarkable woman. Even in present day, a poor woman with no education would not be able to rise up and lead armies, but back then, when it was an executionable offense just for a woman to wear men 's clothes, to have a woman do this is nothing short of amazing! I loved the way it was written, it really brought everything to life, very vivid and connected. Joan was so human and realistic, not a stylized saintly woman but a normal young woman who was abused at home, lusts after handsome young men, has a fiery temper... What a brave person. I ca not wait to go read and learn more about such a remarkable woman. I highly recommend this book!  7 book reviews: I approached this book with some trepidation, since the only works about Joan I would read (except Shaw 's and Twain 's) left me unhappy. I do not like anything that takes Joan 's saints away from her, and one deep, abiding question I have--the question of Gilles de Rais, one of her great generals, later one of the most infamous mass murderers of children and the foundation for Bluebeard, burned at the stake himself for witchcraft and heresy--is never addressed in other works.  The story starts at the end and goes to the beginning, something that I always think is unnecessary. If the story is any good, it will carry us from beginning to the end, and we do know Joan lands in the hands of her enemies. But the storytelling is vivid and realistic, with no words spared for the grittiness and foulness of life, the nastiness of court politics, the smells, the mixed motives of human beings and their sheer pettiness, and their desperation. It is Joan who makes it all glorious, Joan 's vision that makes the landscape glorious, Joan who gives the simple people the understanding that they can re-make their country and bring themselves some glory in their lives. If they lose that understanding, it is because they stop seeing things through her eyes. If she loses it, it is because people wear her down, and her own very real humanity wears her down.  This book is so wonderful. It is so real. It is about the transformative nature of belief and determination as wielded by one young girl. It is about the power of an idea that does not need to be soft-soaped to work.  8 book reviews: Those who are seeking a tidied-up, romanticized tale of Jean d'Arc and the 100 Years' War would be well-advised to look elsewhere.  Kimberly Cutter brings us a gritty, realistic story about medieval warfare as she brings Jehanne, a young girl from Domremy (in the Lorraine) to life. Starting with Jehanne 's childhood (including her sister 's murder by the English), Cutter brings readers straight up through brutal battles, political intrigue both for and against Jehanne, and the girl 's eventual execution at age 18. We see her humiliation and her humility, her pride and her patriotism. Overall, Cutter shows us a complex young woman who is out of her depth dealing with the politics of her time -- but one who is so driven by her faith that she cannot envision failure.  This is the kind of book that serious historical fiction fans love to get our hands on. It 's fact-based and well-researched, and gives us insight to the characters we have read about in drier tomes at school.  (Review based on uncorrected advance proof.)  9 book reviews: The Maid was one of my spontenious book-buys. Saw it on a bookshelf in Heathrow Airport, realised it was a book about Joan of Arc, thought to myself that I knew less than I would like about her life and work and thus concluded that I should buy it. It is a very readable book, written with the simplicity which is so characteristic of novels sold in airports during summer months. This simplicity, however, does not appear to effect the story itself, something which I personally felt was more the result of the serious subject matter rather than Cutter 's literary skills. Where Cutter does excell is at the portrayal of the complex character and psychology of the young Jehanne (Joan) who is thrust into a violent, masculine world of war and betrayal by a trio of angelic and saintly voices (namely those of Archangel Micheal and Saints Cathrine and Margaret). Saddly, Cutter never gives the reader any reason to doubt the authenticity of the voices and thus indirectly concludes that she was indeed a saint, a conclusion which many readers might find hard to digest. Whatever the case, Jehanne jumps out of the pages as a very special young woman (which she no doubt was) and her charisma and skill are justifiably emminent throughout the book. Her masterful portrayal of human -and female in particular- psychology is no doubt a result of the experience Cutter has gained from working with popular magazines in which, I am sure, she was faced with the letters of troubled teenage girls more than once (none of which concerned reclaiming France in the name of God, hopefully). Where Cutter really loses points in my rule book, is in her clumsy portrayal of the age. She describes army camps as smelling of gunpowder, in an age when cannons where used mostly (if not solely) for sieges and would most probably not cause an entire army camp to smell of their ammunition. Also Jehanne, for all her 'holiness' still a peasant girl, addresses her superiors by calling them  'sir' instead of 'your lordship'. Cutter needs to remember that medieval society was rigidly built upon hierarchical foundations and that anachronisms of the kind suffered in the book work towards misguided portrayals of an age which is terribly difficult to define and understand as it is. I do not want people to click away from this review thinking that this is a bad book. Far from it! It is gripping and engaging, very hard to put down! It was a very enjoyable read and I am sure the book will be seen in many sunbeds around the beaches of the world. I doubt that many of those lying on them will be historians, though...  10 book reviews: There were sections that dragged slightly with a little too much war and bickering(of course that is expected)yet other sections completely grabbed my attention. After recently reading a very thorough non-fiction about Joan this book felt like it was well researched. The closer look at her life from a personal point of view, emotions etc. was nicely done and overall worth reading even for those who are not a particular fan of Joan of Ark. For those who are what a delight!  I received a copy in exchange for an honest review via Libboo.com.  11 book reviews: The Maid: A Novel of Joan of Arc by Kimberly Cutter is an intimate portrayal of Joan of Arc s rise and fall from her pivotal role in the Hundred Years War. It begins with Jehanne d Arc as a twelve year old girl from Domremy, France, whose father is the tax collector and king of the peasants, so to speak. Life at home is difficult for her; Jehanne, her mother, and brothers have to endure the patriarch s violent outbursts. Her beautiful sister Catherine had been murdered, which is the possible catalyst for her father s unpredictable behavior. One day, she receives a vision that sends her on a mission to save France from English invasion, as ordained by God. Her destiny is to bring Dauphin Charles VII to his rightful reign after having been cast out as illegitimate and humiliated by his mother, who sold out the French to King Henry V. Once she fulfills her destiny, she falls out of favor as a threat to the new king s reign and is sold to the English, then prosecuted as a witch.  Joan of Arc has been labeled saint, visionary, heretic, witch, etc. However, human is not one of those labels. The stigma of being labelled a saint is that the saint loses their humanity by being placed upon such a high pedestal. Ms Cutter does an excellent job of portraying Jehanne s humanity: she is flawed, impatient, has a temper, has desires. The story doesn t come off as feminist reading, which I appreciated (not that I have anything against feminist literature, but it would be easy to propagate that element in this story).  Another thing I really appreciated about The Maid is that while everything centered around Jehanne s religious beliefs, there is no religious agenda. I felt comfortable reading this book and didn t feel like I was being slapped in the face with a Bible. The book was also well researched and historically accurate (except for Catherine s death, which there is no record of what had happened to her) while still allowing for artistic license with Jehanne s character.  The writing was beautiful. At times, however, I felt the descriptions were flowery.  I felt that the sequences where Jehanne is enraptured by God s light were slightly contrived. It was difficult to imagine the people around her changing their views and feelings by seeing her enthralled, although, I cannot imagine that that is something so easily described.  I also felt that the ebb and flow of the story was slightly awkward, as well as the switches from present to past tense when she rehashes her story to the priest Massieu. I also felt that the battles and everything in between were handled with too much brevity.  All in all, I really enjoyed this book. Had I not won it on goodreads.com, I may not have read it until another year or two after its release. Excellent debut novel; I look forward to reading more of Ms Cutter s works.

It is far too modern in its speech/behaviors and the characters are far too flat.  It does not help that I just finished (finally) A Game of Thrones, and this book absolutely pales in comparison. This is almost a real-life version of Game of Thrones: different kings vying for the same throne, a child leading armies, massive intrigue and brutal deaths.  The real-life people of this story are as compelling and deep as any character: Joan herself, an illiterate peasant girl who helped lead France 's armies to victories over the English, at a time when hope was nearly lost for her country; , king of France during Joan 's childhood, who thought he was and once slaughtered his own knights because he confused them with traitors; the young king who owed Joan his throne but ultimately left her to die; , an English knight who led men against Joan 's forces and who may have been an inspiration for Shakespeare 's ; , Charles VII 's advisor and Joan 's political opponent, who let personal jealousies undermine his support for France 's best military commanders; and of course one of Joan 's military leaders who would later be better known as a serial killer of children.  Joan of Arc in real life must have been a young girl of incredible intelligence and breath-taking charisma. You do not lead a country to war by being mousy and boring. that Joan 's trial record reveals her remarkable intellect and wit. Yet the heroine in this book radiates no cleverness or charisma. Like everyone else in the novel, she is incredibly bland.  Besides the fact that I found myself incredibly bored and disappointed while trying to read this book, I was also irked by everyone 's attitude toward Joan. No, not the \"help, help she 's being oppressed for being a woman!\" That is par for the course in ye olden days and if this was a better book, it would have been oh-so-satisfying watching Joan use men 's low expectations against them (people underestimating you can be a useful tactical tool) and watching Joan triumph over her doubters.  No, what annoyed me was the fact that Cutter portrayed Joan 's medieval world as incredibly secular as the modern world. It was not bad enough that everyone spoke like they were in the modern day, they had to act as if they lived in it, too. Look, I understand that not everyone back then was super-religious, or that even if people were religious (or even members of the clergy!) it did not mean that they were not primarily focused on secular concerns. Some people used religion as a tool for manipulation/power even back then (and I would have been happy if a patron/king 's advisor/the king/whoever would see Joan 's religious reputation as a perfect tool for manipulating/whipping up the populace, and play along with her religious aspect while not actually believing she could talk to God).  BUT, this was still a world where people . I am not talking just saints, either. When Protestantism came around, people died horrible deaths instead of converting to a religion they did not believe in (whether it was Protestants not willing to become Catholics or Catholics not willing to become Protestants). They also made long, dangerous pilgrimages and worshiped saints' bones. And yet, in this book, everyone in Joan 's village rags on her as being \"too religious.\" And maybe she was annoyingly pious, but many people would see her piousness as a good thing, as a fine attribute for a young girl. (and this was without Joan telling anyone about the voices - this was just about the fact that Joan prayed a lot). Throughout the book, people 's comments/reactions are oddly out-of-tune with a world so steeped in religion.  13 book reviews: 3.5 stars for this nice debut.  A very interesting read about Joanne of Arc, which mostly comes across as well researched. (Having been to both Chinon and Loches myself I was excited to read about these places, though the descriptions of them were not very detailed which left me wondering if the author ever visited.)  The chapters are really short, which some people object to, but which I always kinda like, as it makes the book seem like a box of candy. I have noticed another thing some people object to is the story being a bit hard to follow if you have no previous knowledge of this part of French history. I would like to recommend to first read \"Blood Royal\"/\"The Queen 's Lover\" by Vanora Bennett and do some Wikipedia browsing. Another thing people object to is not being able to fully connect with Jehanne, and I fear I must admit to having that problem a bit myself. But I liked how at the end of the book, the chapters and Jehanne 's thoughts seem to become a bit muddled. I thought this was a good way to show us how her power was gone and her doubts grew, and it made me connect more - Well done! I will most likely make sure to find this author 's next book.  14 book reviews: l liked the quick pace and the short chapters. The author had access to a lot of research and the book could have become bogged down with historical detail and background, instead I got the sense of being in Jehanne 's head, seeing and feeling what she did, understanding how everyone and everything looked to her.  This book was a perfect intro to a complex historical figure. I got a feeling for the limited ways women could be in that era. Jehanne was such a departure from the norm that she really stood out. Today, short haired women wearing men 's clothes and who speak their minds are normal. But in the 1400s it was heretical.  I felt the power of Jehannes' conviction about hearing her voices. I do not think it was any mind disease, as has been alluded to, because how else could she have withstood the men of the church and even the french King 's disdain for so long.  I wish I had read the epilogue first because I did not know that the whole book was based on well researched fact. It read like a young adult novel.   15 book reviews: What a cracking good read! I was expecting a dry history novel - this was anything but that! Not having studied this in school, I only knew of Joan of Arc as a young girl fighting for the French who was eventually burned at the stake. This book gave me her entire history and just WHY she did what she did. Written like a story rather than an historical recount, it was easy to get into and easy to just keep reading and reading. Highly recommend this book, well done Kimberly Cutter!  16 book reviews: Joan of Arc. Jeanne d'Arc. Jehanne d'Arc. I knew her by these three names. I always love to read about history. From folktales to historical figures, I love them all. When I first discovered this book, I thought \"now I am going to read more into this Maid of France 's life\". I did not expect her story to contain this much sadness. I mean, in Jehanne 's life from childhood to the end of her life, I feel like she did not experience happiness. She only devoted her life to her God, brought France the freedom it needed and in the end, abandoned by the king she crowned. I think I pity Jehanne a bit, because if I can, I want to tell her myself that sometimes, those temptations are normal because we are all, just humans, and when she resisted them all, it proved that she was a strong woman. I like this book, really. But sometimes, the war stories were a bit hard for me to digest.  17 book reviews: Kinda like 2.75 stars I guess. 2 stars is too few but it s not 3 stars either. Some of the descriptions annoyed me and were gross. The sex shit was a bit much but  guess I learned so I m not complaining, it wasn t a loss. I took a lot of notes. 18 book reviews: Quite an excellent novel of the life of Joan of Arc. I wanted to read this in anticipation of my visit to France later this year. 19 book reviews: Found through Libboo The Maid ...The Maid: A Novel of Joan of Arc is in my opinion an excellent historical fiction with plenty of actual historical facts in it. Author Kimberly Cutter did a phenomenal job and capturing the story of the peasant girl, Jehanne d Arc s beautiful struggle. A woman would not have been treated with any real respect or dignity when it came to affairs that were considered a man s work in the 1400 s but for a 17 yr old girl to leave all she knows because she truly believes that it is God s will and to be successful in influencing so many men in that was AMAZING! How could you not admire Joan of Arc. By convincing Charles, heir to the thrown of France to give a poor young girl such as herself command of his army because she has told him that God wants her to defeat the English and Burgandies as well as assist in seeing he is crowned King of France, one cannot doubt that Joan had great impact during the Hundred Years War. Kimberly Cutter captured the harshness of the time period as well as the awe inspiring events that really took place that elevated Joan d Arc to one of the strongest female heroines of all time. If you can t tell already, everything about this book impressed me. The writing style, the characters, the battles, struggles and the church depicted as a dictatorship in a way that could suffocate the most holy and devout of Christians. I will however say that at first the book did not capture my heart but toward the end I was in love with it. It was like watching an artist paint a scenery portrait, at first you may see some colors and not think much of it but when the artist is finally finished you can see the whole picture and it suddenly becomes amazingly beautiful. If you do end up reading this book then I highly recommend that you read everything, including the two epilogues and author s note at the very end. It was all fascinating!  20 book reviews: Set in the fifteenth century during the Hundred Years War, The Maid tells the story of Jehanne d'Arc (later known as Joan of Arc) as she sets out to fulfill her destiny. Jehanne has grown up in the French countryside and watched as English soldiers tear the country apart. When she is young, she begins hearing voices and seeing angels that tell her that she is the one who will save the France and return the exiled Dauphin to his throne. After overcoming enormous obstacles, she does just this but soon falls out of favor with the new King and is sold to the English who prosecute her and burn her as a witch.  I thought this was an interesting book and well researched but I have to admit that I had trouble getting into it and enjoying it. I never really connected with Jehanne, or any of the other characters, even though I wanted so badly to. She came across many times as two-dimensional and I could not see the religious ferocity she was supposed to project. The battle scenes were interesting but I felt that the rest of the book could have used more detail. Joan of Arc seems like she was such an amazing person so it was a little disappointing that the story felt so flat. I did not hate the book, I did not even really not like it, I just wish there had been a bit more to it and that I had made a connection with the characters.  21 book reviews: This is an interesting, and well written debut book, which focuses on the life of Jehanne d Arc. The story begins, when as a child, Jehanne bewilders her peasant family by her religious zeal, and her ability to communicate directly with saints. Guided by her religious voices, Jehanne sets out to change the focus of European history, when, convinced that God has chosen her to restore power to the French, she embarks on a brutal, and courageous fight for glory. Startlingly honest in its narrative, and loaded with religious fervour, I thought the book explained the historical period very well. The chapters are short and concise, yet manage to convey a huge amount of historical information. The characterisation is excellent, from the historically accurate figures, to the lowly foot soldiers; all seem to blend seamlessly within the narrative. I really enjoyed this book; I felt like I had travelled every step of the journey with Jehanne, and found myself seething at the injustice perpetrated against her.  22 book reviews: 23 book reviews: After every section I forced myself to stop reading 'The Maid' so that I would not stay up all night reading it and so that I could savor each part and delay ending the wonderful experience of reading this book! Sometimes the conversation seemed too modern day, but otherwise an excellent book! 24 book reviews: Read This Review & More Like It On My Blog!  Joan of Arc is a far-famed and widely recognized name, especially if you are a. Catholic or b. French. As a rebel, as a saint, and even as a peasant, this young girl captivated an entire country, following her 'voices' and fighting the English for freedom. Taglined with \"the girl who led an army, the peasant who crowned a King, the maid who became a legend,\" Cutter sets the stage for her version of the world famous knight right from the get-go. I did have to do some reading up on the Hundred Years War during and after reading this because a few details were blurry in my memory and I wanted to check the validity of the events in this novel (medieval France is not my historical forte). Happily, and incredulously I might say, I found much of this novel to be factually correct, all the while maintaining a snarled plot and a brisk pace. Even the most incredible events from the book are recorded as fact (Jehanne 's predictions of a defeat at Rouvray, telling Charles \"Use me. I will last little more than a year\"), and Cutter does a fine job of meshing the facts of the past with her interpretation of the person. She also steers clear of the inane repetition of titles and names of the nobility that some other historical fiction authors cannot seem to avoid. I thought that this was a well-told tale, and Ms. Cutter a more than able storyteller. Never dry, or dull, I was swept up in the story from beginning until the end and her Jehanne is more than believable: she is three-dimensional and vibrant.  The story is told by Jehanne herself, explaining her life up to capture by the English to her seemingly sympathetic jailer in a brisk, almost unfeeling reminisce. With the Hundred Years War raging from 1337 (before her death) until 1453 (twenty years after her execution), Jehanne begins and lives her entire life directly in the tumult of this dynastic warfare, and it leaves a lasting impression on the girl. With the third person perspective in use Cutter is deftly able to weave a complete - and devastating - picture of life in English-controlled France. And it is a harsh, unyielding picture full of mostly misery. With the external pressures of a mad father, a murdered sister and a devastated country, it is not hard to see why she turned to prayer for solace and then began to hear voices. Though plays the voices as if they are actual saints (Michael, Catherine and Margaret to be specific), it is not hackneyed element nor a podium from which Jehanne preaches. I did find the pet names from the saints to Jehanne a bit off (\"cabbage\" and \"darling\"? I could see \"lamb\" I suppose, as in lamb of God, but it was not used) and it threw me when one of the three would reference Jehanne with one of them. Jehanne was also never full of herself, simply stating she was \"a lamp in which God had chosen to burn for a short time.\" Her humility rang true, and remained the forefront of personality for the duration.  Moving at a brisk pace, the novel shows Jehanne through five parts, divided by age or events within. Jehanne 's early life was surprisingly compelling for a peasant in medieval France, and Cutter shed light and personality upon the mostly-historically-ignored family that brought Jehanne into the world. The abduction and murder of her sister Catherine at the hands of the \"Goddons\" (English), though one of the fabricated events, served as a nice foreshadowing of Jehanne 's future treatment by the same nation, and also served to explain more of Jehanne 's reasons for her calling. Her relationship with her father was severely troubled, a symptom that reappears in almost all Jehanne 's later interactions with men and possibly the reason for such issues in the first place. Jehanne is shown to be a full, complete person: she does not survive of religious fervor. The author took care to craft a well-rounded personality who can feel and express doubt and fear instead of an unfeeling zealot: her latent feelings and romance with the Duke of Alencon, her struggles with violence, and even nostalgia from home.. these are all problems with which Jehanne must wrestle and overcome. Jehanne grows into herself: from a shy girl turned away from the dauphin, she becomes a ferocious general, dealing with insubordination and mistrust with ease. Cutter does an admirable job of showing a human side to a saint venerated for her supreme piety. Slowly, her Jehanne is revealed as a woman that is much admired, but sadly not liked within her support base.  Jehanne represents much more than just resistance from the English. She took a dynastic struggle lasting decades between nobles and kings and made it about the country itself. She is a living symbol of the peasantry, fighting for their freedom rather than a King defending his inherited lands. While her prowess at Orleans could be laid at the feet of \"surprise\", I tend to think Jehanne 's natural abilities were the cause. The excellently described, gory battle scenes were a high point for the novel as well: each seemed alive and different than the preceding fight, practically thrumming with excitement and action. All in all, this version of Jehanne was utterly compelling and engaging. Though the end cut off before her execution, the timing was perfect. It felt like the end; there was no need to see read her execution at the hands of the English. A nicely well-rounded and plotted historical fiction, alive with tension and fear... this was one of the better historical fictions I have read so far this year. More than enjoyable, and though not astounding, is a great historical fiction novel for anyone looking into a fun read about Joan of Arc.  25 book reviews: This is really a 3.5 for me. I have, of course, always been fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc. Kimberly Cutter 's treatment of the story is both engaging and thought provoking. 26 book reviews: We know the story. How it starts and how it ends. So, why bothering reading another book about Joan of Arc?  Well, this book superbly fills in the periods between the historically documented events.  ~Spoiler Alert ~  This is a story of Jehanne whose beloved older sister is raped and murdered by the English. Their father grieved the death of his favorite child like a madman - screaming, sobbing at the sky, and hurling himself against trees. When he finally returned home, he slept. For a year.  When his father came out of this grief-stricken lethargy, he became clairvoyant. He saw terrible things about Jehanne 's future in his dreams, and they horrified him. Jehanne suffered beatings at his hands before, but after her sister 's death, she could not walk for a week after one of his savage beatings.  The more he tried to control her life, the more defiant she became, in little ways he could not directly detect. Then the final straw came when he arranged a marriage for Jehanne. After having watched the wretched lives of women around her, Jehanne would rather die than get married and lead a miserable life with a husband who would beat her.  She decided she would rather die.  About the same time, her voices came to her. The voices told her to do things that were impossible for a peasant, let alone a peasant girl to accomplish. She was instructed to raise an army and to drive the English from France. She must lead the Dauphin to Reims to be crowned. How was she to accomplish all this?  Well, she started by teaching herself to ride and fight. Then she raised her army by persuading one important man at a time. The courage to face the entrenched enemy and the tenacity to stay with the struggle when she was betrayed by the very man she was trying to crown king of France was inspiring.  How did she do it? Or the better question is, why did she do it? Why did not she just walk away? Others have. Other knights and men have abandoned their struggle and went back to their homes, why not Jehanne?  She knew she would die. She had an inkling of how painful her death would be, but she stayed the course, even after it seemed as if her voices abandoned her, too. But as soon as she followed God 's instructions, the voices came back. Finally, she was able to face her horrific death with comfort and peace.  I ca not imagine what it would like to have your greatest fear or joy (depending on how you look at it) come to life. I do not think it will be a blessing to hear voices in my head, even if they tell me they are angels. How do I know they are who they say they are?  I would like to believe Jehanne was very human. That she felt all the joys, sorrows, humiliation, rejection, and rage that anyone would feel under the circumstance, but she marched forward and followed God 's will.  But I kept thinking - why did not she just walk away? Or could she walk away, even if she wanted to? Did she have anything to walk away to? Had she walked away and returned home, what would await her?  I think she would be a ruined woman - situated uncomfortably somewhere between a saint and a whore. Ruined either way. Who would want to bed a saint? That would be blasphemy, right? And remember, she wore men 's clothing and intermingled with them freely. Either she would have to get married and she would rather die than marry. Or she might be locked away in a convent for the rest of her life. Maybe a horrific, heroic death was better than slow, spiritual death by physical, emotional, and mental abuse. Bodily death would follow in time. Maybe too slowly.  I recommend this book because it wo not let me go. I keep thinking about it, even several weeks after reading it.  27 book reviews: I reviewed this book for luxuryreading.com.  I think it s fair to assume that most people have at least heard of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d Arc). We ve read of or seen the movies depicting Jeanne on her divine mission to rid France of the invading English and put the rightful King on the throne. However I, for one, did not know the full story of where she came from and how she ended up a martyred saint of France.  The Maid by Kimberly Cutter has done a wonderful job of bringing Jeanne to life and giving me a firmer grasp of who this young, brave maid was and what she really did for the God, and country, she loved.  In The Maid Jeanne relays her story   from dirty, abused farmer s daughter in Domremy to captive prisoner of the English   to a priest named Massieu. We learn of her humble beginnings and her firm belief that she was born for so much more than the meager, cruel life of a farmer s daughter and eventual wife. When she is visited by the powerful voices of saints in her parents  garden at the age of twelve, she realizes that she cannot be tied down to any man but must do whatever God commands in his service. And what he commands is for her to ride through France, lead an army to fight off the English and crown King Charles VII in Reims.  For me, the beginning of Jeanne s story was slow going. Once she leaves Domremy behind and begins her quest, however, the story becomes unputdownable. It s action-packed and you cannot help but cheer for Jeanne in the hopes that she will be able to fulfill her mission and find some happiness in this cruel land she s been born into, even as we re told she is destined to die early on. The language and violence can be harsh at times but I felt it helped showcase the brutality of the war and warriors that Jehanne was surrounded by. The final betrayal by Charles VII and the seeming abandonment of her saints were devastating, but her ultimate decision to either live as a liar or die as a righteous daughter of God brought her story to a sad but satisfying conclusion.  Cutter describes in the author s notes that much of what is told in the story is known fact and it makes the book that much more fascinating. She was able to take these seemingly miraculous facts and surround them with enough description and character development that I felt like I was right there next to Jeanne on her journey and on the battlefield. I am now very eager to read more about this enchanting heroine.  28 book reviews: I have always had a \"thing\" for Joan of Arc. Book reports and essays in school too numerous to count. When I saw an historical novel about her I grabbed at it and thank God I was given this advance.  I LOVED this book. So many stories have been told about Joan but none that makes you feel what Joan felt like this one. Much of the book is based on true history - events and what times were like - the rest filled in to give us this enlightening account of Jehanne d'Arc.  Jehanne was, above all, dedicated to God and her religion. She believed her voices were her saints, giving her strength, courage, and determination. Given those things to help her survive her peasant, destructive family and the horrible death of her sister. Given those things to help her be stubborn and persuasive, getting her army together, getting men to follow this lowly maiden.  Cutter 's story is exquisitely told. I never wanted to put it down. The fluid, beautiful writing bore into my heart and soul. I felt Jehanne 's pain and agony, I felt Jehanne 's adrenaline and power, and most of all felt Jehanne 's light and love for God. I understood the passion that overtook her, that sometimes made her doubt, but that was always there to guide her forward to her destiny.  Cutter gives us a perfect interpretation of what the times were like, what the warriors were like with their booze and their women. This was so important to understand, that this young peasant virgin got men of this kind of rawness to follow her in order to save France. It was something I feel I never \"got\" as completely as I finally did reading The Maid.  Joan of Arc is, to me, the greatest woman in history, religious or otherwise. The Maid is the book that finally does her, who she was and what she did, justice.  29 book reviews: I started reading this book knowing next to nothing about Jean of Arc and quickly found myself hooked on the story. It facinated me how a girl of seventeen could achieve so much, be so brave. However, though she was a brave and fierce leader, she started out as an uncertain girl, which I thought was good, because it made her seem human and relatable, rather than just the legend she has come to be. After all, despite the things she achieved, she was still just a girl.  The book was quite simply written, but I think that style of writting fitted nicely since it is the story of Jehanne, who was an illiterate peasant - it would have seemed weired and out-of-sorts if it was complex and poetic. Also, I think the simplicity of the sentances often made the reading more intense, especially when Jehanne was pulling that arrow out... that actually made me cringe.  A few times, I did find myself getting confused as to who was who, since there are so many characters and a few have similar names, but at the same time, the Author 's Note at the end explains that they are all real and that pretty much all of the events were also real, hence why there were so many characters. I was also really pleased to hear that pretty much everything that happens in the book actually happened - I love it when a book sticks to the true events rather than embelishing them.  All in all a very good book, which would be great for Jean of Arc fans, or for anyone who just wants to know a little bit about her.

    " The Whole Body Reset: Your Weight-Loss Plan for a Flat Belly, Optimum Health & a Body You'll Love at Midlife and Beyond": "book reviews: This took a whole lot of pages to basically say eat healthy foods, but add more protein at breakfast. This information was shared over and over. There were some good recipes at the end, though. 1 book reviews: This book is primarily for people around 50 years old, trying to counteract the physical decline of aging - loss of muscle mass being given the most importance. By following the Whole Body Reset, you are eating protein in the proper amounts during the day and avoiding the crash & burn of carb loading by forcing your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates to keep up a constant source of energy. This approach is a little more reasonable than strictly limiting carbs altogether. The recipes are very good and emphasize portion size and timing of meals. A good rule of thumb is to make sure the amount of protein and fiber you consume at each meal is larger than the amount of sugar or carbohydrates. This method of weight loss does not promote intermittent fasting, but does say to make your heaviest meals early in the day. Drinking adequate amounts of water and exercise is of course, important, especially using weights, to build muscle. I especially liked the kale smoothie recipe and use that for one of my meals. I have not lost more than 5 - 6 lbs at this time, but the diet is for a 12 week period and I have only been following it for 4 weeks (with 1 week of vacation in between!) However, I wanted to post a review close to the publication date. The Whole Body Reset method is not totally new or groundbreaking, but it does seem to be a sensible way to live a more healthy life. I have reviewed a digital copy and will probably purchase a hardback version of this book so I can have easy access to the recipes.  2 book reviews: A new way to look at dieting. I love the adding more in rather than cutting and depriving yourself. 3 book reviews: While not entirely new concepts, \"The Whole Body Reset\" did provide some good compass points for improving health in middle age and beyond. The first half of the book is based on scientific principle, while the latter focuses on recipes (many of which were appealing). I did find this probably would have stood just fine as a magazine article, as the underlying principles are simple and often repeated:   for women, eat at least 25g of protein per meal   eat 5g of fiber per meal   make sure your protein and fiber exceed your grams of carbs   stack your protein heavier early in the day than later The focus is on adding nutrients and activity rather than removing \"bad\" nutrients or habits, which can help many find a sustainable nutrition plan rather than feeling deprived.  4 book reviews: Outstanding! This book offers a practical, evidence-based, and sustainable approach to nutrition for middle age and beyond. While it is targeted to those 50 and older (a demographic that has not historically been the focus of nutrition research), it is absolutely appropriate for those in their 40s. No special foods are required, and nothing is strictly prohibited (though, not surprisingly, surgery drinks, white bread, and fried potatoes are not recommended as part of your daily diet). Also, this approach is completely adaptable to any diet and lifestyle: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, etc. Here s what s different: New science shows that our metabolism does NOT slow down until about age 60, and even then the decrease each year is minimal (.07%). However, we don t absorb or as efficiently use nutrients as we get older and this causes loss of muscle mass over time. Loss of muscle mass leads to weight gain (in particular, belly fat), which is correlated with loss of mobility, several chronic diseases, and premature death. Bottom line: You ve got to preserve that muscle! To do that, it is important to eat at least 25 grams of protein (which helps to build and maintain muscle) at every meal and, no, you cannot do as most Americans and just eat all that protein at the end of the day with dinner because the body cannot process more than about 30-40 grams at a time. You also need to eat at least 5 grams of fiber at each meal and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. And, you absolutely must do some form of resistance training, whether that be lifting weights or doing bodyweight-only exercises (e.g., yoga, pilates).  I started weight lifting a year ago and began following a nutrition plan similar to what s presented in this book about 6 months ago and was able to lose all my COVID weight (between 10-15 pounds) and, at 43 years old, become the fittest I ve ever been. However this book made me realize that I need to eat a bit more protein at each meal, and that I don t always eat enough in general, so those are changes I have started to make, and I m already noticing that I have more energy.  The only reason this book does not get 5 stars is that there is quite a bit of repetition. I m certain that it is intentional, and it does help to cement the ideas presented in the book, but it also makes for somewhat clunky writing. 4.5 stars.  5 book reviews: All over the place  This did not teach me anything new. I also wish I could find a helpful book that did not involve shoving eggs down everyone 's throats. Some of us are allergic to eggs. With that said, this book was all over the place, no step by step, more here, there and everywhere. If you are a human with a brain, you already know that as we get older, EVERYTHING slows down. We do not need to be reminded in every sentence.  6 book reviews: I do not know what I expected from this book developed by AARP. If you are over 50 and have not read much on senior health and dietary issues it would be helpful. For the rest of us, there is little new information but it is synthesized well for others. The author compares some popular diets with this one which is based on protein timing. It includes many recipes, ways to evaluate the foods we eat, and what to select in stores and in specific popular restaurants. One chapter gives exercises for strength and balance. Action Steps pages at the end of some chapters invite the reader to set improvement plans.  7 book reviews: Eat protein and fiber. Ta-da! 8 book reviews: great book here is a link if you want to check on amazon https://amzn.to/3Hz7u5U 9 book reviews: Meh, it was alright; I liked it enough to finish it. While there are probably a lot of people out there looking for good sound health and diet info who will find this book and its recommendations, recipes and meal plans educational and informative, most of it was stuff that I already knew and have read before. The author is an author and editor for the AARP Magazine as well as the  Eat This, Not That  (I love that column), which gives him some credibility about health and diet knowledge for older people (50+).  There is a lot of good info on how no matter how much you exercise or diet, once you hit your 50 s, your diet and exercise plan can actually work against you and the author explains why and what you can do to change that. As someone who discovered the Mediterranean diet back in my 20 s, when I became a vegetarian for many years, I learned what were the healthier choices when it came to veggies, carbs, fats and protein sources. I learned the value of  protein timing , which is basically eating more protein earlier in the day. I also learned what healthy portion sizes where and the importance of portion control.  While I m not a vegetarian anymore, I remain an advocate and practitioner of the Mediterranean diet to this day. I ve also remained active for most of my life and still exercise regularly, with both cardio workouts and strength training. Unfortunately, I have also learned (the hard way) that my biggest diet weakness (gaining weight) as well as my greatest diet strength (losing weight) is directly tied to my ability to manage and control stress. Additionally, menopause has wreaked havoc on my body. I m not alone in my difficulty in maintaining a healthy diet because of stress and menopause; a lot of women in their 50 s suffers from this. Unfortunately, neither of these topics warranted more than a brief mention in this book.  Like a lot of folks, the pandemic with its isolation and the stress of remote work took a toll on my life, work, health and my body. My stress levels were out of control. It wasn t until last year, after a physical where I was told I was pre-diabetic because my A1C levels were higher than recommended for a woman my age, that I knew I needed to make some serious changes in my life. First, was to address my stress levels because I knew, from experience, that nothing else I could do would make a difference until I got that under control.  Today, my stress levels are sooo much better, as a result of instituting some non-negotiable work/life balance parameters. As for my A1C levels, that s a whole other conversation for another day. After getting that diagnosis, I immersed myself in research on A1C levels (thank goodness, I LOVE to read). Suffice it to say that I was glad to see that the author did address the fact that the US dietary guidelines can, at times, be outdated and not cognizant on new studies and findings about certain types of diet, health and lifestyle choices. Yes, I am more cognizant of my sugar intake these days, however, I am not going to worry about my A1C levels that are just slightly higher than the  recommended  level for a woman in her 50 s. These recommended guidelines need some serious updating.  Once again, this is a good book for someone who doesn t know what a healthy diet looks like. It s also good at teaching people like that how to make healthier choices. For that, I would also recommend the author s health column,  Eat This, Not That .  10 book reviews: Book rather disorganized structurally....felt like it hopped around a lot. However, I did pick up some ideas to try for managing weight when older. I will be paying more attention to how much protein I get at breakfast and monitoring my fiber each day. 11 book reviews: I recently finished the https://flipthischick.com/ program, a transformation program that is similar to The Whole Body Reset. The book gives great advice and confirmed what Alicia teaches. 12 book reviews: It makes a few good points but is repetitive  The Whole Body Reset makes the case that your nutritional needs change after 50 and as such, your eating patterns should change as well. The book is very specific as to what that should look like, no fad diets here, basically Mediterranean eating with a focus on spreading out protein intake throughout the day, and making sure to eat plenty of fiber and nutrients. Nothing to argue with here. The writing style is distractingly repetitive and does not add anything after a while. The recipes were nice but not that compelling. The exercise descriptions were basically useless without pictures, there are many better ways (videos) to learn the same thing. Worth a read (or a skim) if you want some reinforcement to take up healthier eating habits.  13 book reviews: This is not a weight-loss book. These are guidelines for getting the nutrition we need as we get older. Lots of information on what to eat and how to Incorporate it into your life. Highly recommended. 14 book reviews: \"The Whole Body Reset: Your Weight-Loss Plan for a Flat Belly, Optimum Health and a Body You will Love at Midlife and Beyond\" was referenced in a webinar that I took. I looked it up and ordered it. I found the book to be revolutionary for me! If anything, it has generated a lot of discussion with friends and family. My husband bought his own copy of the book, and several others in my sphere have ordered and read the book.  Author Stephen Perrine (with Heidi Skolnik) focuses here on a healthy lifestyle for those fifty and over. AND the lifestyle that he lays out here is based on RESEARCH done with those fifty and over. This is something that we rarely see or read about in the media. Healthy lifestyle recommendations often are really for those younger than fifty. Our bodies and needs change as we age. Duh!  \"The Whole Body Reset\" focuses on the following:  - increasing daily protein intake (25g. per meal for females) - increasing dairy intake - eating colorful fruits and vegetables (30 different fruits and vegetables per week) - increasing daily fiber intake (5g. per meal) - eating more healthy fats - not drinking calories  Takeaways:  1. This is a lifestyle, not a DIET - no counting calories, no measuring portions, no recording food (though these might be good things to do if you are having trouble getting started, or not making the progress you would like) - no incessant weighing of oneself... 2. Perrine 's work is well-supported with research, and that research was actually done with subjects who are 50 and over! 3. This is so doable! Even after making minor changes for a few weeks, I feel better! The idea of eating breakfast and including lots of healthy protein at breakfast was an area where I really needed work. 4. The book recognizes those who are vegetarian, vegan, etc. Personally, I have a dairy allergy. Though this is mentioned, I wish that more time had been spent on how to incorporate more protein (especially at breakfast) for those with allergy issues. Dairy is an easy source of healthy protein, but not all of us can make use of this. 5. Over 100 pages of the book are dedicated to recipes that incorporate the \"Whole Body Reset\" philosophy - excellent!  I highly, highly recommend this book for those of us who are of a certain age!!! It really has changed the way we eat and live in our household.    15 book reviews: Whole Body Reset is perhaps an overstatement. The point isn t to lose weight, but to avoid losing muscle as we age. It s targeted towards so-called elders, many of whom are younger than me these days. Anyway, I like the protein-loading-in-the-morning idea. It does cut down hunger later in the day. The book s whole point is protein loading, with a side of fiber from veggies. This is good advice, but incomplete for maximum health.  The book de-emphasizes aerobic/cardio workouts in favor of a bit of strength training. In my experience, cardio movements keep the body flexible and increase stamina. Walking is an important skill to maintain! The exercises suggested are easy to do, and there are few of them. But from my experience, other exercises are needed to maintain muscular strength, for example a triceps stretch with weights, and Pilates style movements for core strength.  Overall, I found the dietary information useful. A few of the recipes look good, though I haven t tried them. I have put the  add protein  idea to use in my own cooking. Hopefully I m maintaining my muscles, because I did not lose weight! (Nor did I gain.)  Overall 4 stars (really liked it) for quality of dietary information and practical protein-building ideas. Especially the charts quantifying the amounts of protein and fiber in best food sources. But I d look elsewhere for the important exercise component to maintain and build muscle strength.  16 book reviews: First, this is not a diet book. It is a book that teaches us how to eat through midlife and beyond. There 's a lot of info about how to stop losing muscle as we age, through simple food choices. I found the info to be straightforward and explained in a way that made sense to me. As a person who has NOT eaten healthy my entire life, I have already made some changes in my food choices. After checking it out from library, I plan to buy my own copy. I am also impressed with the authors' education and experience in this field, and that it 's recommended thru AARP.  17 book reviews: A practical guide to understanding what and how to eat in midlife and beyond to live longer, healthier, and leaner. This isn t a diet so much as it is a way to eat and nourish our bodies as we age and the WHY behind it, which I really appreciated. 18 book reviews: Protein, protein, protein! That is the theme of the book. We do not eat enough of it, especially at breakfast. (And we should eat more fiber, too.) The author explains how these needs change as we age and offers research and recipes as well. 19 book reviews: A very interesting and seemingly practical way to change the way we eat. Recipes, restaurant information, nutritional information as well as tips and troubleshooting strategies are included. This whole body reset concept makes sense to me. 20 book reviews: One of the best health/diet books I have read. Practical advice. Doable actions. This was tested by an AARP study and is geared toward older adults. A book I will refer to again and again. 21 book reviews: Interesting perspective on how our nutritional needs change as we age. 22 book reviews: Lots of great information in this book to eating healthy. Taking notes was a great idea. It s the kind of book you may want to purchase. So glad it was recommended to me. May borrow it again from the library. Really enjoyed! 23 book reviews: Breezy, fun tone; science seems reasonable. I ve only read it, though haven t tried out what it says. If the recommendations pan out, I ll come back and re-review (I pinky-swear!). 24 book reviews: ** This review was written years after the book had been read. Instead of writing immediately after the reading, some contents may be recalled inaccurately. Date started and date finished are approximate for reference. **  \"Weight loss\", \"Midlife\" and most importantly \"Flat Belly\" have caught my attention to save and read this book. Based on my understanding, it is very difficult to lose weight on a specific part of the body. The closest approach is to train and tone up specific body part or muscle. However, I do not find any information useful or convincing to achieve a flat belly. The counter argument probably pinpoints due to my unwillingness to try the diet plan or the way of living suggested by the book. In contrast, without much convincing argument or evidence, I am not convinced to give a try.  Most contents in the book are not something novel or new to me. Eating and living healthily are keys to achieve good health. However, I do not find its findings or suggestions novel enough to lead to a reset to one 's whole body. To me, reset indicates something so novel or intrinsically different to restart or refresh our way of life and our physical body. Eating non-processed food, lean protein, low GI carbo, fat with fatty acid ... have been embedded into our mind (though it is another matter when embedding into our lifestyle).  Still, there are a few points noteworthy including the generic approach of cutting down calories intake to achieve weight-loss without sufficient in-take of quality protein. This approach helps reducing our weight as well as our muscle which is already in the process of losing during mid-age. Muscle is key to our physical strength and fat burning rate. Our aim should focus specifically on reducing fat instead of muscle in our body to achieve ideal figures and weight.  Another point is the harm caused by belly fat on our body. It is a vicious circle of poor diet and living style leading to generation and accumulation of belly fat which causes inflammation to our body and further deterioration to our ill-health. Somehow, I also have some hesitation to this argument as fat also accumulates in different parts of our body e.g. chest, limbs and bottom. Body fat (especially too much of them) certainly causes harm to our health. Most probably, the author wants us to focus on a flat belly and thus mentions this part of body fat most throughout the book.  This book offers a bit of insight on what we should pay attention to when losing weight at mid-age. However, do not expect lots of unknown or innovative information in particular on achieving a flat belly.  25 book reviews: Reading a variety of diet books is fascinating because each author develops theories on what is right and what is wrong with our diet, what we should eat, what we should not eat, when we should eat, and when we should not. Each book is motivating, but it leaves the reader confused. What can I eat for optimum health?  When I read these books, I look for what they have in common and what the authors agree on and take it from there. The Whole Body Reset shares the same theories: stay away from refined sugar, processed foods, red meat cold cuts, the middle isles of the supermarkets, and eat more whole foods. Good, solid advice.  I liked this book because it focuses on a specific audience (those 50 and older), how to avoid muscle loss, a realistic exercise routine (including resistance training), solid nutrition guidelines, and it is liberal in regards to the type of foods we can eat. Thank you Mr. Perrine for not making me feel guilty each time I pick and eat a nightshade vegetable from my garden, including my peppers and tomatoes.   26 book reviews: My 1st recommendation for following the advice in this book, is to contact your physician and ensure that your kidneys can handle this level of protein. While I understand the need to have adequate protein, and to space it out for better absorption and utilization, I also recognize many older folks have less than perfectly functioning kidneys. (Retired nutrition professional)  Pros: It 's a fairly easy read The explanations of other diet plans is decent Advice to eat more whole grains and produce is excellent Options for lean proteins and vegetarian sources are abundant This can be done fairly well on a tighter budget.  Cons: The book could be far shorter. If a person who does not eat much fiber hit this too hard, too fast they might experience GI distress as they adapt Sodium could be high if eating out too often Exercise chapter not well done. No illustrations E version is difficult to read. Charts are split between pages No real consideration as to a person 's size. I tried the principles for a week and was miserably full. I normally follow a DASH/Mediterranean style of eating, and it was simply too much food.  27 book reviews: I read about this book in AARP. The article gave me all the information I needed. It would have been helpful if there were a few diagrams for the exercises that were given. I may be trying some of the recipes. 28 book reviews: Wow! Hope for anyone over 50 who struggles to lose weight. It s different for us! And they say it s not about metabolism but muscle loss and can be fixed with protein timing. Been following their guidelines for 3 weeks and what I love the most is that I feel so full! Also love that it s not a deprivation diet. No food categories are off limits. It s a very healthy program you can do forever. Hoping the scale goes down  they say it will. 29 book reviews: Listened to this and it constantly mentioned PDFs for more information yet there were NO PDFs included. Very disappointed. ",
    " Ugly Love: A Novel": "book reviews: 1.75 stars    oops this is awkward. i know this is a beloved CoHo book and yes, i loved this back then when i first read it but rereading it now i- do not look at me.    my reading taste have changed oookay? i might have overlooked every shitty thing back then but now that i am more petty, have the penchant for holding a grudge, and have high standards for books ooohh boy.        i read this years ago and the only things i remember is that Miles got horny while he was wearing swim shorts? (idfk why i remember this do not ask), Miles and Rachel 's shower scene (again, idfk why i remember this but i wish i can unsee it thank you very much), and then the Nick Bateman trailer??  anyways, that 's all i remember and i know, they are all irrelevant but do you know what i forgot?? huh? do you? DO YOU??! well, if you have read this then you can probably guess what i did not remember because HOLY SHIT- the scene at the end. guys... GUYS.    i was speechless- . i canNOT believe i forgot that scene holy shit. the anger. the annoyance- the fucking that i felt when i read that oh my god. anyways, i am ranting again and y'all know the drill so,          you know what, i am gonna be straight to the point: . or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it was intense. now, now. lemme explain.  the problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking                  do y'all see this   ? this is the type of thing i wanted to see from Miles' pov when he 's talking about Tate Rachel but we never got to see this until the very end. and then when we get to the present chapters it 's 98% in Tate 's pov where we see falling in love with Miles and this is annoying to me because seeing Miles treat Rachel like a goddess in his past chapters and then Miles being a little dickhead in Tate 's chapters ugh-  energy? not .  and with most of Miles' pov being in the past and falling in love with Rachel, obviously i could not help but compare and overanalyze every single thing and think he seems more in love with Rachel. and the thing that annoys me the most is that Tate 's present pov and Miles' pov alternates so whenever we read Tate and Miles' romantic progression, the next chapter is Miles being so deeply in love with another woman, it 's just...    i could have done with just past Miles pov instead of making it every second chapter or making it 50% of the whole content and showing the way he fell in love sooOOoooOo deeply with Rachel instead of just having 1-2 chapters of his pov about Tate, who 's the . it 's just so and icky the whole time for me and i just felt bad. i know i have always complained about telling >>> showing in other books but this is the only time i will ever accept all tell, no show.     what makes everything more annoying is how Tate just lets him use her for sex and forgives him way too easily all the damn time like bish NO make him work for it for once and stop being a doormat it 's annoying (yes, i know i have said the word annoying one too many times but that 's how i felt 99.9% of the book OK).    ma'am pLS-    the whole time i was just yelling at her, . ugh this pissed me off so much i could not even cheer for their romance because Miles was eh and honestly had no redeeming qualities in the present and then reading about his past pov being all in love with Rachel and in the present he just uses Tate for sex and pushes her away quite rudely all the damn time is, , A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G.     no seriously. all they ever did was have sex, Tate hoping he would renege his rules and tell her that he does indeed love her and want a relationship with her, Miles pushing her away, Tate forgives him and then they fuck. repeat.     and then- AND THEN i was just reading Tate and Miles' repetitive interactions where i thought the same shit would happen again and again in peace but THEEENNN...  ... ...  ... ... are you ready? OK    um excuse me-    you are probably wondering, well, i do not know let 's look at the quote again shall we? are you guys ready?        there. did y'all see that? okay? good.  now, not gonna lie with you guys, this one . when i read this scene i did not know how to feel to be honest. was i shocked? appalled? speechless as fuck? all of the above?? yes. now with this scene, my annoyance reached its peak and is higher than the fucking stratosphere because why you ask? well, it 's because there is !! Tate leaves, Miles lets her go and says it 's hard to feel bad for her because she 's never felt real pain, then goes to Rachel for closure, goes to Tate and explains his past and all is forgiven???    i am pretty sure this is where my hatred for trope came from.  now, some might say that he gets a pass because of his sad past- because it really was sad by the way - but you see, for the majority of the book we have been reading about how Miles fought for and loved Rachel, and Tate fought for and loved Miles, for once i wanted to see him fighting for Tate but we never got to see that because again, there is       : *.  .* : .    i ca not believe i rated this 5 stars back then. i do not know who pre 2019 mel is. we do not know her.  honestly, because of the ending, i was this close to rating this 1 star because that 's how annoyed i was with everyone but i felt generous today so. as always, i liked the emotional writing and how i can feel the longing and passion between Tate and Miles when they are having sex, the whole \"ugly love\" message, and learning about Miles' past and why he 's the way he is?? it was so sad.  but overall, everyone annoyed the f outta me (except for Cap- he 's the best character in this book), this is basically Miles and Rachel 's story, and the ending was unsatisfying as fuck.  * * *     1 book reviews: **** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: 6 STARS!!! ****    Casting for Miles...     It was absolute stunning perfection in every way. My heart is just overflowing with emotions    Starting with  and , then with ,  and , and once again with , Colleen Hoover has proven over and over again that her stories are unique, powerful and incredibly well written. I have come to trust her writing implicitly. I love the passion she conveys in her words, the depths of the connections she establishes between her characters, and the effortlessly beautiful style in which writes her stories. Without a doubt, she is one of my favorite authors.  is beautiful, sexy, and heart-wrenching. It 's powerful, compelling and emotionally charged with a unique storyline that was truly unlike any other I have read. For days after  I finished reading, my mind would drift back to Miles and Tate and relive moments of their story because I just could not let go.  ________________  I fell in love with the story on page one. You might think that the first page is a little early to proclaim undying love for a book but I instantly felt  -- it was like I would just stepped right  the story.  We first meet Tate when she moves in with her brother for a fresh start where her path quite literally crosses with airline pilot Miles Archer as he lies passed out drunk outside her new place. Despite her initial judgment of his character, she quickly learned there a whole side of himself he was hiding from the world -- a deep, bottomless pit of pain and sadness.  She was not looking for a relationship and he wanted nothing to do with love but they had an undeniably powerful attraction towards each other. Drawn together, but unwilling to give themselves wholly over, they agreed to a friends-with-benefits arrangement following Miles' two, unwavering rules that would forever keep a distance between them.   The more time they spent together, the more complicated things became as the lines between friendship and love began to blur. As Tate began to give her heart over, Miles fell further away. The pain of his past was so great that he never again would allow himself to fall in love. Not for any reason, or for anyone.   However even through the most painful and ugly times, there 's a healing power to love. This story left me emotionally drained but on the most amazing book high you can imagine. It was a powerful journey that showed how even after the worst possible devastation, love can always find a way.  ________________  Every single moment while reading this book, I was something, and feeling it strongly. It was thrilling, mysterious, sexy, alluring, emotional, it was in the exact perfect balance. From the start, it was clear that we were not seeing the full picture so each scene gave us another piece of the puzzle that was Miles' past. Everything just made me want to know I could not turn the pages fast enough!  Miles was such an intriguing character to try and figure out. Enigmatic. Mysterious. Smart. Sexy. Sensitive. His past so full of pain that it shut him away from wanting any hope for his future. Not only was he unable to move on, but he genuinely did not  to.... and he was willing to do everything in his power, to sacrifice, to never again have to experience so much pain. Seeing him struggle internally with both his aversion to love and his growing attachment to Tate was just heartbreaking. His pain felt so that I can honestly say, I have never wanted to hug a fictional character this much before.    We were shown the story through both Miles and Tate 's POVs in a mix of both present day storylines and flashbacks. The present was told from Tate 's perspective and, because of how mysterious Miles was, we got to see flashbacks from his POV six years earlier. And as these little pieces of his past slowly began to line up with his behaviour in the present, I was able to begin putting together the real story he was hiding.  He kept so much hidden that all the little things between them -- the hint of a smile, the stroke of a thumb, a quick glance -- became much more powerful and meaningful. And because of the build up of all these little moments, when Miles and Tate finally got together it was explosive!  Dear long-time CoHo fans, be prepared for !!!!!  This is a whole new side to Colleen Hoover 's writing and let me tell you, it is and Trust me, you will be fanning yourself ;)    But on a more serious note.... The more I read, the closer I got to discovering the source of Miles' pain and when it hit, it was!!! I can honestly say that few character 's backstories have made my heart shatter as Miles' did.I cried -- no,  so much that I could no longer see the words and so I just sat there with tears steaming down my face absorbing the huge emotions this story evoked.    I want to promise you though that this story is worth every tear because the way all the pieces of the story come together was absolutely gorgeous. The ending will leave you with a joyous feeling but the journey to get there is not an easy one. It 's beautiful but so broken.  ________________  I have read the book twice now and I know I will be reading it many more times to come. I have the book hangover of the century and I am finding it hard to let go of Miles and Tate because of how strongly I connected to them. Truly, I do not think there can be greater proof that this was a book.  I have loved every book Colleen Hoover has written but  one is my favorite.  is a must-read book of the year! I loved every word, I felt every moment, and I will never forget this story.  I do not give out a lot of 6 star ratings (in fact this will be the first one I have given this year) but the truth is that this book went above and beyond. The story was powerful, the writing was stunning, and the way every single piece of it was woven together was simply breathtaking.    And... I still want to hug Miles              2 book reviews: HOLY CRAP ON A CRACKER!!!! MY HEART IS SO PERFECTLY BROKEN! I DON'T THINK I TOOK A BREATH THE WHOLE TIME I READ THIS BOOK! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME COLLEEN HOOVER!!! I HATE YOU BUT I LOVE YOU! YOU RUINED ME AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH!  IF YOU CAN'T GUESS IT BY MY NON STOP CAPS THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THAN SCREAM \"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!\"  WOW JUST WOW! I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHEN I'LL GET OVER THIS BOOK HANGOVER.    was nothing like I expected it to be. I excepted it too be like a fan fiction with just a butt ton of thrown together steamy scenes... No, it was not it was so much more. I knew I was going to like Miles (because he sounded so hot), but I had no idea that I was going to love him. That he was going to have an actual back story... That he was going to be actually interesting in a realistic way... I had no idea he was going to break my heart. All that being said I have a few bookish confessions to make before I really get into the review, I choose to read this book 1) because I heard it was becoming a movie and if there 's anything I love nearly as much as reading it 's seeing movies 2) because this is who they have playing Miles:    Yeah I did not notice the dog at first either...  and 3) I also need to admit that I did not get what was so appealing about this book that it was actually going to become a movie... I get it now. I get all the hype and talk surrounding this book. I have cried so hard in a book. That 's the very last thing I thought this book was going to make me do.  The characters in this book felt so real. Tate was naive and normally that would make me wanna punch a B, in her case it made me love her. Unlike most leading ladies she is not overly sassy, or has incredible lol rebuttals,she was realistic. Her brother Corbin, OMG CORBIN, I loved every single thing about him. He has to be one of my favorite sub characters ever. He was what I imagined a brother would be and even with him not being a constant character just his presence had me. Then there 's Miles and he is hands-down the star of this book. The moment you meet him you hate him. He is a mysterious mess and I thought he was going to annoy me fast. He won me over once they started going into his back story. The further they went into it the more I could feel what was coming...  The switch between time and POVs was done flawlessly and revealed the perfect information at the perfect time to keep you hooked and wanting more. Colleen set up this story so at first you would only like Miles because of his looks (which I have already made clear I was guilty of)...    And yes, he is a looker, but by the end I could have cared less about what he looked like. He could have worn a bag over his head for the last half of the book and my heart would have still been his. The relationship between Tate and Miles is like nothing I have read before. It was something else that really surprised me about this book. Saying it was complicated would be an understatement. I thought that the steamy scenes were going to take up most of this book, but it did not... Yeah that 's something that would normally make me rank a book lower, but the scenes were so well written and again realistic. They were well placed and well thought out. Just enough to make this book not \"too much\" which is what had me falling hard for this read way harder than I anticipated. Miles and Tate 's conversations roll so smoothly and the moments between them are so; I do not even know a word for them, they are just perfect (). Not only is he romantic but he made average things so hot.  whoosh.  Honestly though the scenes that turned out to be my favorite were just \"average scenes\", like when they all go and visit Tate and Corbin 's family for Thanksgiving. That whole section had to of been my favorite. I loved how I thought this story was going to be Tate 's but turned out to be Miles'. I love how I thought this book was going to be a light sexy read but turned out to be a heartbreaking love story. I just loved how everything came together while falling apart.. Because when all Miles story is finally shown and is laid out in it 's fullest I was basically like this...    I want to rant and rave even more about this book, but this is something you really need to read and experience for yourself. might just be the biggest surprise read I have had all year. I ca not express enough how impressive the characters, plot, and play out of this story are.   I do not know if I can ever forgive Colleen Hoover for what she did to me, but God dang it I love her so much for it. I did not see this coming and I have never been so happy to be emotionally slapped in the face like I was reading this.  3 book reviews: If you are a fan of the book, please do not read this review. It 's going to upset you, and then you are going to hate me and leave mean comments, and then we ca not be friends anymore. It will be awkward all around. So yeah, best avoid.  Seriously, last chance to turn away.  Okay, now that I am among like-minded readers (all three of us who did not like this book), what the heck was this? Was Colleen Hoover blackmailed into putting her name on a book written by a hormonal teenager? Because I ca not comprehend any other explanation for the hot mess that was this book.  Gosh, where to even start? How about with Tate and Miles, our main couple. So they meet and it 's lust at first sight. But Miles ca not do relationships because some unexplained thing has hurt him in the past. So now he can only have no-strings-attached sex. (Cue eye roll.) Of course, Tate ca not say no to such an amazing offer, so she jumps right in. (Another eye roll.)  Sure, the premise is a bit wack, but not all hope is lost. The characters must at least be likable, right? Well, no. Miles does not talk or smile, which is mentioned at least once on every single page. In fact, he smiles so rarely that Tate composed a poem on the one occasion he did:    If you are wondering how anyone could possibly fall for a nonverbal, expressionless man-child, your guess is as good as mine.  Then we come to Tate, the world 's biggest pushover, letting Miles walk all over her and treat her like a sex doormat. Yet she keeps going back for more, reeking of desperation and utterly devoid of self-respect. Lest you think this makes for an exciting story, I assure you there 's a reason why silent/clingy has not taken off as a popular romance trope. You would think he promised her the moon and the stars, but no, he just said, \"You look pretty, Tate.\" I kid you not.  We also have interweaved the story from Miles 's younger years, the one that explains his pain. He and Rachel are young and in love, but things keep getting in their way. It definitely makes for very angsty (shudder) drama. But that is not my biggest issue. My biggest problem is that it 's written like this:     Is this a joke? And here 's another example:   In case you think I cherrypicked the most ludicrous examples, those are actually from the same page. In fact, every page written about Miles and Rachel reads like this. And it has the most ridiculous formatting, with line breaks galore, everything center-aligned, and random italics thrown in for emphasis.  Why is the writing so juvenile when Miles is supposedly 18 years old? Why is every scene between the two couples so cringeworthy? And why is not this book called \"Idiot Love\" instead? I do not have any answers, just questions.  As I was reading this, I kept feeling like I was on some hidden camera show, and any moment, someone would jump out of the bushes and yell, \"Gotcha!\" Then they would hand me the real book written by Colleen Hoover, and we would all have a good laugh over how thoroughly they got me. But sadly, that did not happen.  I have a love/hate relationship with Colleen Hoover, and this one unfortunately falls squarely in the hate category. Since I have read most of her recent books, I thought I would catch up on some of her older ones. But that was clearly the wrong decision. Maybe she 's one of those authors who gets better and better as they go, and this is just too far back from her current style to resemble even a little of what I love about her writing.  And one last closing thought: if you are a young woman (or young man) reading this, and you think this is the way love is supposed to be, just no. You can have spark and sizzle and lust, and still be treated with kindness and respect. Do not ever let someone walk all over you and do not ever settle for less than you deserve. Tate should have kicked Miles to the curb a long time ago. If she had, this would have been a story worth reading.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  /     ~~~~~~~~~~~~         4 book reviews: 2 stars!    First, I really have to thank my good friend Geri for buddy reading this with me or I would ve taken a screwdriver to my eye long before I finished this book. I honestly have nothing positive to say about this book so I m going to put all my complaining in a spoiler tag so I don t purposely hurt anyone who loved it.                                                                         Everything this woman has written, I have enjoyed reading but it s too bad that this time, CoHo wasn t able to win over my emotions. Out of author loyalty and because she wrote the Slammed series (one of my top favorites), I m going to give it 2 stars when I really want to smack one star on this book.  5 book reviews: 2-UGLY Stars    I know most of my GR friends in fact, most everyone loved this book, so please do not throw rotten tomatoes at me. I wish I could say I loved it, too, but I ca not.  When I read a romance, I need to some semblance of that romance. I need to at least of the characters. If that 's not possible, I need to be able to with one them. Unfortunately, I never once felt the romance, and I could neither like nor sympathize with either one of the characters.  As this story progressed, I found it impossible to like the hero or the heroine when I felt neither one of them deserved respect or admiration. The hero, Miles, treated the heroine, Tate, with such blatant disrespect it was appalling, all the while wallowing in self-pity and self-hate to excuse his behavior. Then there was the heroine, Tate, who had so little respect or dignity for herself when it came to the hero, that she continually allowed him to use and treat her like a PIECE OF TRASH. I did have to give her some kudos for the fact she was honest with herself and admitted she allowed him to treat her so abhorrently.  As for the romance, for me, it was nonexistent. I found it impossible to feel any romance when most of the hero 's POV took place six years in the past. His POV did give light as to why he was so broken, but also focused on how completely, madly, and hopelessly he was with  So basically, the whole book was the hero showing love and respect to his first love, while treating the heroine, with her blessing, like trash. It was , which I guess was the point of the story, but I certainly did not enjoy reading it.  Colleen Hoover is a very talented author. Her characterizations are consistently outstanding and she has such a beautiful way with words. My respect and admiration for her work is the reason I am giving this book two stars instead of one.    6 book reviews: This book was miserable. It goes toe to toe with Hopeless for the worst book I ve read by her. There are three things that I think went horribly in this book. First, there is blatant sexism and the perpetuation of gender stereotypes on every. single. page. Second, this main character had absolutely NO self respect. I know this may be part of the plot, but it was absolutely despicable. She let Miles walk all over her and decimate her feelings to a pulp. She was spineless and pathetic, which was infuriating. Even when she would say or think something sassy, she would NEVER follow that up with real actions. But lastly, and probably most significantly, the way that this story is told was just twisted. The main conflict in the book follows Miles. It s about Miles  tragic backstory and how he comes to terms with that and how he can never love again. Why, then, does this story attempt to revolve around Tate? She is completed subordinated to Miles, and she s the main character!!!!!! Tate was pretty much a doormat this entire book for Miles to walk across as he sorted his own issues out. And she tries to sell this as a book about two people in a relationship just for sex? No. It s manipulative, it s one of the most UNHEALTHY relationships I ve ever read about, and it gives off COMPLETELY disgusting messages to young women reading this book. Colleen always writes books that deal with mentally destructive topics, and each and every time it is always done SO unhealthily and wrong. Every time I read a new Colleen Hoover book, it genuinely shocks me that people rate them so highly.  7 book reviews: i read this in one sitting and it was ok. i was invested from the first page to last. i appreciate how easy this was to read with the complex emotions involved. it just wasn t epic like i wanted it to be.  i don t hold these characters to perfection but at times they were so frustrating to read about. at times i was like  Tate, stand tf up, you deserve better  and  Omfg Miles.  the ending felt a little rushed but i did have the biggest smile on my face when i read that epilogue. i simply wanted to be head over heals for these characters by the end but i wasn t. or not to the extent i wanted to be. their connection with each other just wasn t as strong as it should have been for me to give this a higher rating.  i loved the writing and the flashbacks weren t annoying like i thought they would be. reading Mile s poetic pov was refreshing. i love the relationship both Tate and Miles have with Cap. Definitely shed a tear once i realized what the cover represents. i m over happy i read this book. i just kinda wished it had a bigger impact on me ngl.  8 book reviews: Finished Ugly Love in exactly 24 hours, could not put it down! So good. Now I know what all the fuss is about with Colleen Hoover books! Ca not wait for the movie :) 9 book reviews: this definitely elicited emotion but i ca not help but feeling like a lot of the issues in this book could have been solved with some therapy 10 book reviews: everything could ve been avoided if miles just went to therapy 11 book reviews: Fuck you Miles   12 book reviews: coho male leads seek therapist first before hitting on women challenge (impossible) 13 book reviews: this book is my 13th reason 14 book reviews: miles go to therapy challenge 15 book reviews:  We both laugh at our son s big balls.   enough said. 16 book reviews: In those six whole years he never thought about going to therapy???????? 17 book reviews: i ca not believe they are talking about his son 's balls 18 book reviews: this one s for all the  i can fix him  girlies out there. not me, y all stay safe though 19 book reviews: perfect for fans of life with derek or brandon and callie from the fosters 20 book reviews: wow i literally cried  from the horrible writing 21 book reviews: Jeny przez przypadek za pierwszym razem oznaczylam j  na pi  gwiazdek xddd 22 book reviews: guys did colleen paid you all to say this book was good or what    the main characters     tate, my self respect queen   is the most two dimensional character ever and trigger warning!   miles was playing with tate s feelings the entire time saying things like  If I were capable of loving someone . . . it would be you.  like okay    and yes it was just \"friends\" with benefits but she fell in love and he did knew that or had a clue and still said those things like (????) if you were so sure you were never gonna love her then why say those things and when miles acted like an asshole to tate and shit she still went back to him every time and there was no groveling that was the worst thing about it she forgave him way too fast (because poor miles ) girl was literally treated like garbage the entire book and did not even hesitate to forgive him I ca not even try to defend her honestly and do not even get me started on the  My God, Rachel  because the fact that she could look past that is just unreal     their relationship was awkward and painful to read and his trauma should not be used as an excuse of how badly he treated tate the entire book, there is something called therapy. a year time jump where he actually goes to therapy and then they reconnect would ve been great tbh but we all know colleen likes her unhealthy couples  It 's the beautiful moments like this that make up for the ugly love  lol no. there are obviously books with a lot more of questionable behavior from the mc but how they wanted to make it seem this is how a relationship or love should be is ugh. this is definitely not something anyone should allow, want or search for in a relationship and I know this is fiction but still it 's so frustrating.  finally, the fact that Rachel gets blamed for everything is fucking stupid, my girl was traumatized as much as miles, she obviously didn t act in the best way but stop the unnecessary hate       23 book reviews: for the love of god, let 's stop romanticizing emotionally abusive men. miles archer is shit. 24 book reviews: 2.5 'underwhelming' stars!  Well...    I hate being in a minority when it comes to books. I wanna be able to love or at least like the books that most of my friends love. Furthermore, there is no other book I would really love to have the same feelings for than this book because it 's CoHo, you guys. I love CoHo.  But. But... I. Did not Love. This. One.    I wish I did. Most of the things that bothered will be reflected in the way I am writing this review.         See, I could forgive Tate for being a doormat during most of the book. I really could. While I do not understand why she allowed herself to be treated that way by Miles, I was willing to overlook it since I have enjoyed doormat-y heroines before. I mean, whatever floats your boat, Tate.  But the writing just threw me off. Sent me on downward spiral through.......  PURPLE. Hell.  The 'lyrical' prose did not work for me. If you can call it lyrical. To me, it was just repetitive. I am sorry. But it was.      If it is not repetitive, it 's too flowery. I come from the School of Less is More when it comes to my prose. Suffice it to say...  This. Annoyed. The. Crap. Out. Of. ME.  It was a chore to read. And honestly, it did not lend itself well to Miles' POV. I mean, this does not sound like an 18 year old male.    Does it sound poetic? Yes. Is it romantic? Sure. Does it feel authentic?  I would probably felt more of Miles pain had it been written in a straight-up, no BS prose. I wanted it raw and gritty. I wanted the words to hurt. I did not want to be lulled to sleep by it. Frankly, if I would wanted to read poetry, I would read a poetry book.  I did not hear Miles through the narrative and because of that, I became disconnected with his character. I wish I could have gotten more of his POV in the present. I really do. And did not like that his past was told separately from what 's going on in the present. I never really got the satisfaction of seeing Miles tell Tate about what happened to him. Maybe I would have felt something then. Again, I am in the minority with this but that 's just really how I felt about it.  I did like parts of it, hence the two stars. I like how the message of how the ugly side of love is sometimes worth experiencing to get to the beautiful parts of it. But Tate and Miles relationship did not really evolve for me. I think Cap and Tate spent more meaningful time together than Miles and Tate, which is really sad.             We both need to find a five-star read, chickie. Our BR record sucked ass!! LMAO!   25 book reviews: I am surprised I am still medically okay after rolling my eyes so much.  blog wishfulfillmentsylwia twitter exsixtwosix booktube wish fulfillment 26 book reviews: There 's one thing I do not understand with romance novels.. When the characters and plot does not actually remind me of a love story. This is pure lust and obsession. There 's a trope that everyone is familiar with: the man who does not want to commit and the woman who wants to change him for the better. It 's not new, it 's not exciting, it 's just boring. This one had it all and I was terribly not impressed. Sprinkle that with sex scenes and this is what you get. I was more interested in Miles' past and I had many theories, but I was not truly accepting of him being super in love with a girl he laid his eyes on for 5 minutes. He literally falls in love at first sight. But if you read it, it 's more like an obsession.   She 's in everything. Every single thing has just become Rachel. It 's consuming me. My new favourite flavor is Rachel. My new favourite thing is Rachel.   I was expecting a shrine dedicated to her. I could not stop rolling my eyes.. Not only is Miles the wounded hero with the tortured past, he was also just blah. This man had no expression and I get he had an invisible wall but still.. I just could not find his character attractive.  Tate is also just as bad in my opinion. She will literally talk about how his hand is touching her or his foot or knee and I could not keep my eyes from rolling. Please just stop Tate. You are attracted to his body. You barely know a thing about him and you say it 's love? This is not love. It 's lust with a little bit of like. You like him because he 's mysterious and I applaud you for not giving up on him but really??? A relationship hardly starts with just sex involved.  More quotes from Tate:   I am not Tate when I am near Miles. I am liquid, and liquid does not know how to be firm or stand up for itself. Liquid flows.   Tate is literally obsessed with Miles. Miles used to be obsessed with someone else. Definitely not a love story I would enjoy. I am upset I did not like this more but the characters were all tortured and obsessive and addicted to one another. We all know that is not remotely healthy at all. I just also did not care about them. It was all lust and sex. Where was the romance?? And that ending????? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? After 6 months??? Ugh I did not find it entertaining at all. I was bored and pretty much sped read through most of the sex scenes.  First time reading Hoover 's work and I had such high expectations, maybe I should have started with another of her books because I am seriously disappointed.   RATING 1/5  QUOTES  \"I have always found guys more attractive when they put less effort into trying to appear attractive.\" (58)  \"That 's how it is when a person develops an attraction toward someone. He 's nowhere, then suddenly he 's everywhere, whether you want him to be or not.\" (59)  \"I just do not want to like you. I do not want to like anyone. I do not want to date anyone. I do not want to love anyone.\" (82)  \"Addiction is an illness, and it pains me to see people forced to live this way because they are unable to help themselves.\" (132)  \"I have wondered how someone could make me so incredibly happy if God did not exist. And I realized just now that God gives us the ugliness so we do not take the beautiful things in life for granted.\" (142)  27 book reviews: 1 STAR You know when even one star feels too generous? Yeah, that 's me right now.  \"Ugly love becomes you. Consumes you. Makes you hate it all. Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts aren t even worth it.\"      Someone, please explain to me why everyone hates Miles? Now do not get me wrong, i do not like the guy either but i perfectly understand the cause of his actions. Did he ever promise Tate \"true love\" or any other shit? No, he offered fucking with no attachments and no sentimental bullshit, and that is exactly what he delivered. I do not see what the problem is here. I despise Colleen Hoover for romanticizing this kind of behavior. Like, or Ugh are you fucking kidding me? Am i the only one who ca not stand women like this? Bitch, please! Self-respect, you need some in your life.    Trust me when i say i really wanted to like this. It started out great but after about 70 pages everything went downhill. I feel like there were lots going on at once, but none of it was original. I have read better.        Despite it 's unoriginality, it could have still been enjoyable were it not for our main character, Tate, who i hate with a passion. She ruined this entire book for me. Man, i do not think i have ever read a character this stupid or this exasperating before . . and i have read my share of idiotic characters.  Was i supposed to be on her side? Was i supposed to feel bad for her? I could clearly see why Miles sees her nothing more than a good fuck. She has no respect her herself. I feel nothing for her and Miles as a couple or fuck buddies. The sex scenes were extremely boring and tedious. I pretty much skipped most of their parts.. which is the entire book, sadly. I was so fed up with her bullshit.    For me, it was always Rachel and Miles. I was always looking forward to the flashbacks. The only reason i did not DNF this is because i was so hooked on \"WHERE IS RACHEL?\" or \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO RACHEL, MILES?\" I hated HATED the ending. How the hell do you move on from something like this? They belonged together.  This is possibly the last book i would read by Colleen Hoover. It 's more than obvious her and i do not get along. However, i am low-key curious about Maybe Someday. Maybe I will read that one as well but i am in no hurry.      There is a very thin line between cute and and annoying.    Kady and Ezra: Annoying. Nik and Hanna: Adorable AF! ^()^    Miles' crush on Rachel: Hella fucking cute! Tate throwing herself at Miles: Fucking irritating.  Dat poetry tho! LMAO!    ^^  ^^  I am not the biggest fan of Hoover, but want to give her one last try before completely giving up on her.  28 book reviews:  Love isn t always pretty, Tate. Sometimes you spend all your time hoping it ll eventually be something different. Something better. Then, before you know it, you re back to square one, and you lost your heart somewhere along the way.     Ugly love becomes you. Consumes you. Makes you hate it all. Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts are not even worth it. Without the beautiful, you will never risk feeling the ugly. So you give it all up. You give it all up. You never want love again, no matter what kind it is, because no type of love will ever be worth living through the ugly love again.    Wow!! Ugly love is amazing!! I absolutely loved it!! It is the 3rd time I read it and I still cried even though I knew what 's going on.. It all started when Tate moved in with her brother Corbin. She meets Miles (Corbin 's best friend) and the attraction between them was undeniable. BUT... Miles has a past that hunts him every day and Tate does not have time for a relationship so they make an arrangement to have sex without any commitment and Tate have to follow the two rules Miles has for her.                              29 book reviews: 5 Flying in Love stars!    Colleen Hoover has done it again. Not that I ever doubted her, but I didn t know what to expect when starting Ugly Love. It s safe to say she never disappoints. With her amazing writing style, fascinating characters and original story lines, I was hooked from the beginning. I expected to love this book. What I wasn t expecting was for my heart to be shredded.       This book pulled at my heartstrings. I felt so much heartache while reading. There were some lighter moments, but the majority felt heavy and emotional.  When Tate decides to move in with her brother for a while, she never expects to meet a man like Miles. Miles is a pilot like her brother. Miles is taciturn. He seems flat. But there is something about him that intrigues Tate. Miles and Tate develop a friendship, kind of. It s difficult to be friends with someone who is closed off like Miles is. You can just feel the sadness radiating off of him. Then it happens. Tate feels like she is starting to make progress with this man.    Miles really likes Tate. But the last thing he is looking for is love. Their attraction and chemistry is too strong to deny, so they go with the whole  friends with benefits  thing. As long as Tate can follow Mile s two rules, they can be together in that way. Tate is so enamored with Miles, she ll take him any way she can get him. She s never felt this strongly about a man. She feels so much when she s with him, she can t get enough.    Miles is the way he is for a good reason. The book is in dual pov, going back and forth between Tate s perspective in the present, and Miles perspective in the past. You get to see as time goes on, why Miles has these rules and why he is protecting his heart this way. When you get hurt in such an ugly way, you want nothing to do with love. No matter how beautiful it can be. But that doesn t stop Tate from developing feelings for him. Even though she knows they can never be reciprocated.  Miles is a character that broke my heart. At first you see his past and the type of guy he was  then you see him so standoffish in the present. It makes you wonder what could have happened to make him that way. I had my theories (all of which were wrong) but once I found out- I wish I would have been right. It was something unimaginable and you can see why he wouldn t be able to move on from that.     I loved the chemistry and the slow build between them. Even though the feelings were fought most of the book, you could still feel them brewing just below the surface.  I think every book I ve read by this author has made me cry. Even if it s just a few tears, I always cry. This book. I did more than just cry a few tears. Oh the tears. There were times I couldn t control the tears. They just streamed down my face continually while I read through them. It was heart wrenching and so emotional. Ugly Love made me Ugly Cry. Big time. Some parts were worse than others, but wow. I just FELT so much while reading this.    I am a huge Colleen Hoover fan and I ve read every one of her books. This one has a little something different than the others. Most of her books make me feel strongly and contain a lot of emotional moments, and Ugly Love had that for sure... but it also had much more steam than the others. And yes- CoHo can write some sexy scenes!  It s been a while since I ve read a paperback book, but when I heard this was out early at several bookstores, I ran to my local store and picked up a copy along with a mini light so I could read in bed. And I did. I stayed up way past my bedtime reading this book. I went into work the next day sleepy and raw from crying, but let me tell you- it was worth it! Although still takes the top spot of my favorite book by this author, this will be a close second!  Colleen Hoover is one of those people who is doing what she was born to do- she 's sharing her amazing stories with us. Her writing style is unique and incredible. is captivating, beautiful, emotional, and devastatingly painful to read but I ll let you in on a little secret. The ending makes every ounce of pain I felt worth it. An unforgettable story I highly recommend!    ",
    " Verity": "book reviews: 2.5 stars?  This was straight-up hilarious. The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that people cried while reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.   SPOILERS   So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman, , read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is.  Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I do not even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue.  She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity 's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that does not concern you love, put down the manuscript   It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in. . like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night 's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.  I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time.      Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end  Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching  Running around the house like Casper the ghost  Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren  Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to him  Safe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean like , she did do all three of those at one point or another .  Whereas usually I would be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun 's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me.     How I imagined Verity every time she would unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine  Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.      Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I was fully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.  So many missed opportunities   I bet every time she rose from her \"coma\" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav.  I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she was not creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie.    And look.... Verity is pro choice   You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I have ever read. EVER.  In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3   Jeremy:    Luman   Their sex scenes were also about as hot as you would expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.  Anywho the ending? We are not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply did not care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power.  8 months later and I have decided we are gonna talk about the ending. Here 's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I am gonna choose the letter. As we have already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC was not any better. Personally being impressed with the author 's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist... if this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it was not, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one.   I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).  Yuh that 's about it.  I have read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering  1 book reviews: 2 book reviews: Check out my 7 better thriller recs to read instead of Verity on YouTube    Writing: offensively bad/5 | Plot: nonexistent/5 | Ending: abysmal/5  THE PLOT  Lowen is a struggling writer who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to co-write a series with acclaimed author, Verity Crawford. When she arrives at Verity 's home to do some research, she comes across a disturbing autobiography revealing the truth about all the tragic events in her life. Should Lowen let Verity 's \"dreamy\" husband, Jeremy, know wassup? Or just sex him instead? Find out!    NOW LET'S BUCKLE TF IN BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO BE A ROUGH RIDE (not the sexual kind Verity LOVED).  I want to keep this \"short\", but I am not sure I have it in me. This book tops Stay Awake and Unmissing by a MILE. I picked this up even though romance is not my thing because I literally cannot log onto Goodreads without seeing a Colleen Hoover book. So I had to find out for myself, and I certainly did, and as they say... curiosity killed the cat.  OK. SO LET'S GET INTO IT.  - Lowen was unnecessary. Literally this whole story could be told without her POV. You could have just had the diary entries as a POV, with Jeremy struggling in real life, and then BAM that \"twist\" at the end. Not only was she unnecessary, but she was ANNOYING. BIG pick me energy. So you thought Amos choking you was rock bottom but you sexing a comatose woman 's husband in her marital bed was chill? Ight. And honestly her whole sleepwalking story to create empathy in the reader was garbagio.  - The writing was appallingly bad. This was BEYOND closed caption ass writing. Even a blind person did not need this much detail. Did we need to know that Verity 's writing software of choice is Microsoft word? No. Did we need to know that Lowen picked up her drink, took it to the stove, filled her bowl was spaghetti, reheated it in the microwave, then went to the fridge to grab a glass of water before sitting down at the dining room table? NO. But yet we do.  - The gratuitous sex was literally like being in a 14 yo boy 's wet dream. DISGUSTING. I literally skipped PAGES and PAGES of sex. What in the 50 shades of gross is this? How did it add to the story? If you are horny, there 's p0rn. PLZ. We do not need this in a \"thriller.\" ALSO. The whole \"oh I was just exaggerating for the sake of it\" does not hold up WHEN YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS ARE LITERALLY SEXING IN THE EXACT WAY YOU DEPICTED IT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SO???????  - Jeremy had the personality of a wet cardboard box. Legit how did ANYONE fall in love with the man when he said/did nothing of substance. This is what they call dickmatized. Free my ladies.  - Also, also... this book did no favours for writers tbh. Saying shit like \"I write suspense novels, of course I know about your girlfriend\" does not make any sense???? I am not like WOW HER BRAIN, I am like... wow.... is her brain ok? What is the correlation?  I'M ABOUT TO WRITE SOME SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK     - Plot holes? Nah, plot CRATERS. How did she fake the brain scans? Why did not Jeremy just kill her when she came home from the hospital? (maybe I missed something?) Girl is up at night sneaking around opening bank accounts but ca not reach out to a friend and be like HALP??? And do not use this whole autobiography as the reason, because your publisher could corroborate your story and you are telling me you never discussed it with her afterward????  - The letter at the end was atrocious. A perfect example of when authors try to hand-hold the reader through the twist to make sure it lands. I did not need a perfect play-by-play of what your pretending ass was up to in a letter. I gleaned it from you just saying \"SIKE I WAS FAKING.\"  - Lowen \"forgiving\" or \"justifying\" Jeremy 's double murder attempts was brutal. C amon. Not during women 's history month.    Pros: I finished this  Cons: I read this  ___ 3 book reviews: Me, rollerblading into my therapist s office with heart-shaped sunglasses and a pi a colada and dropping this book on the desk with a loud thud: Boy do we have much to talk about today!  Why read Verity when you can just pull out an Ouija board and summon a demon from hell? I am sure it ll have the same effect. I finished this book feeling completely sapped of life, as if I have been bleeding freely for the past few hours instead of simply reading. That ending. What the hell. If I could just shake my head to dissolve the memory of it, to disarrange it somehow, I would. Because of all the things I d braced myself for, was not it.  Right. Let 's talk plot.  Lowen Ashleigh is set free from the long tedium of her daily life when she s employed by Jeremy Crawford to ghostwrite the remaining books in a popular series his wife, Verity, is unable to finish due to an unfortunate accident. Lowe acquiesces in the spirit of hope: that this opportunity would help her acquire some small measure of celebrity and that celebrity would be oxygen to the fire of her career. But nothing prepares Lowe for Verity s autobiography, which she accidentally stumbles upon one day. For the horror of it. Verity s secrets paint a different picture of what Lowen thought she knew of Verity, Jeremy, and their lives together. But sooner or later, as these things often go, the whole truth will spill, and the fraught waiting in-between would come to an end, with havoc and screaming and loss.    I love books that make me backtrack my own declarations of preference. The books that catch me completely off-guard, astonish me, keep me on my toes. I picked it up with a great deal of skepticism. I did not enjoy any of Hoover 's previous work, and did not think Verity would tip the scales. I ve never been happier to be so wrong because this book absolutely lives up to the buzz.  is a huge departure from Hoover 's catalogue. It 's a fiendishly clever, mind-bending whirligig of a book. The plot is a hall of mirrors where everything is a vacant reflection, including the people who live there. Hoover draws you into a world where illusion informs reality, and time enfolds hauntingly. She lures and tricks and wrong-foots. Always, she wields her unreliable characters to stunning effect: confounding, disturbing and delighting in turn. Not only is nothing what it seems, it s not even what it seems after it s been revealed to be not what it seems. And I was entrapped in this story long before I even realized the net was already cast.  The book 's biggest triumph to me was the sheer energy threaded the pages, how it feels uncontrollable, yet it is perfectly under control by the author. I like the way Hoover makes you feel Lowe s deep-skin unease and confusion as if it 's your own. You can sense the danger pulsing all around, and while you can scarcely see the freshly hideous future taking shape ahead, you can feel it all the same. In short, if I were Lowe, I d have gotten the out of there. I d have been impressed by her courage if I weren t too preoccupied repeating a litany of  GET OUT OF THERE, YOU IDIOT  in my head.  And, , the ending. That shit struck me backhanded. I am still reverberating from it. Because here 's the thing: offers its reader no solidity of truth that they could hold in their hands. Even as I was reading and rereading the last chapter I was mining it for clues, trying to make sense of something that felt so utterly senseless. Everything I ve read up until that point felt like a false memory and I was left shaking my fist at the whole book for leaving me on such a hideous note as it did. Because, .  So, yeah. I am going to let this story haunt me for a long time. 4 book reviews: Bold. Unrelenting. All-consuming. Creepy. Unputdownable.  What I ve come to appreciate most about Colleen Hoover s work whether it s an emotionally charged love story or in this case, her first go at suspense is her penchant for pushing boundaries. For telling the unexpected story.   It s got bad things in it. Bad words, bad people, bad scenes.   Hoover preempted  s release with a warning of sorts although facetious and comical in delivery, it s something sensitive readers should take to heart. This storyline is , and the lives of the characters that inhabit the pages are far from perfect so, don t kid yourself into thinking this is something it s . is horrifying, maddening, and what-the-hell-inducing, but it s also sustenance for that bibliophile looking to satisfy a craving for something .  From chapter one, it s blatantly obvious comes from an entirely different side of Hoover s psyche than her typical love stories. Blood spatter accompanies the all-consuming, addictive quality of her words. Storytelling with the power to crawl inside of your mind, take over, and demand your undivided attention.  Lowen s life is literally in shambles her mom just passed, she s broke, on the brink of eviction and even though she s a talented author, the crippling anxiety involved with marketing herself to fans has made her work less than popular.  It s the opportunity of a lifetime that uproots Lowen from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the quiet Vermont countryside. Contracted by a publisher to ghostwrite the three remaining books in an uber-popular series after the author was involved in an accident, Lowen has a ton of work ahead. Research lands her in Verity Crawford s home office, looking for anything that might indicate the direction the author wanted to take the series. Instead, she finds herself caught-up in Verity s life. Living in her home, sleeping in her bed, and spending time with Verity 's husband, Jeremy, and their young son. Inescapable is the grief and pain marring it all.  Most surprising was the level of creepiness Hoover managed to incite. A level even some seasoned suspense writers fail to attain. From someone who reads in the genre consistently and watches horror, it s quite the feat for me to feel this level of anxiety. For my stomach to be twisted in knots, in anticipation of what s to come but, it happened.  And that finale . . . . I was so sure I d pinpointed exactly what was happening and , but I was wrong. So very wrong.  Hoover mentions in her that this was an indie project she wanted to branch out and write on her own, which is commendable and exciting when you think about where her inner drive might take readers next. While there s no denying her love stories are fierce, my hope is for suspense. To be this taken with her first try, I can only imagine what that mind of hers might dream up next. 5 book reviews: \"Find what you love and let it kill you.\" -Charles Bukowski  Woah, this was fuuuucked up. It should really come with a warning: do not start reading this at night if you want to sleep.  For two reasons, actually. One, it is so compulsively readable that it 's almost impossible to put it down until you have finished it. And two, it is seriously creepy and disturbing. Warnings for depictions of child abuse and some graphic violence.  Perhaps this does not need to be said, but is definitely not a regular Colleen Hoover romance. There 's a love story, and sex, but it is predominantly a creepy thriller. And a mindfuck, if we are being honest.  is mainly about three people - struggling author Lowen Ashleigh, a man called Jeremy Crawford, and Jeremy 's wife, Verity, who was recently left incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is a successful writer, but she is no longer able to continue her bestselling series. That 's why Lowen is brought in to complete the remaining three books. To do so, she stays at the couple 's house so she can go through Verity 's notes.  But Lowen finds something else in Verity 's office. An unfinished autobiography. As she reads, her fear grows. Lowen begins to dig into dark truths about the family and the deaths of their twin daughters. At the same time, she finds herself falling for Jeremy and wondering if perhaps she should reveal the truth to him.  I do not want to say too much, . Hoover expertly leads us on a winding trail of lies and manipulation. As the story is essentially Hoover - an author - writing about an author reading about another author, there 's this constant sense that someone is lying to you-- but who is it? Now, that 's not so easy to tell.  This may seem like a bit of a backhanded compliment, but I think I enjoy Hoover s fucked-up books so much because I usually find her regular romances kinda fucked up. than when she 's trying to sell me a douche as a love interest.  It 's a clever book, and I do not simply mean because of its twists and turns. It 's clever because of the fear and uncertainty the author creates. That all three authors create. The aptly-named is a novel about fictions and truths, about authors and characters, and about how it can sometimes be hard to separate the two.  I found it absolutely riveting.  | | | | 6 book reviews: I will never look at Steak n  Shake the same way   Colleen Hoover and Lisa of Troy finally meet. Alright that s weird. I am never referring to myself in the third person again .  So what s the scoop on Verity?  In Verity, we find Lowen Ashleigh who is a down-on-her-luck author when she gets an incredible offer to finish a series by a famous author, Verity Crawford. When Lowen goes through Verity s office, she discovers an autobiography by Verity with salacious admissions and jaw-dropping tales. What will Lowen do with the information she has discovered?  This is my very first Colleen Hoover work so I will share with you my general impressions, not sure if these are hallmarks of her other books. Hoover keeps the action flowing with short paragraphs and sentences. There are no page long paragraphs here.  The storytelling is top notch with gossipy revelations sprinkled throughout the book. This book is filled with steam. Steam upon steam. Steamy steam. Descriptions of steamy steam. However, please be warned that this book is incredibly, incredibly dark with some graphic depictions of child abuse.  In terms of structure, Verity really reminded me of the book, Home Before Dark by Riley Sager, because it would also switch back and forth between modern day and back to an old book. The main character, Lowen, does have internal ruminations, but the author masterfully navigated these sections and did not get lost in the weeds.  Verity is page-turning and reading it is certainly not a chore.  There are two things that kind of bothered me, but with me, storytelling is everything. And this book had it in spades.  First, the ending did not surprise me at all. Without trying to spoil anything, the ending relies on a familiar trope that I saw coming very early in the book.  Second, a part of the ending did not make sense. Again, I don t want to spoil anything, but it has to do with a certain reaction to the manuscript.  Personally, if I was the editor of this book, I would have rewritten the ending, but (sadly) Colleen Hoover has not been ringing my phone off the hook.  Overall, Verity is a dark, page-turning tale, and I look forward to reading more from Colleen Hoover. Highly recommended for those who are fans of May Cobb. Or try May Cobb if you enjoy Colleen Hoover.  2024 Reading Schedule Jan Middlemarch Feb The Grapes of Wrath Mar Oliver Twist Apr Madame Bovary May A Clockwork Orange Jun Possession Jul The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection Aug Crime and Punishment Sep Heart of Darkness Oct Moby-Dick Nov Far From the Madding Crowd Dec A Tale of Two Cities 7 book reviews: 8 book reviews: How did Colleen Hoover ever think up this dark and twisted tale? It is so unique, so completely shocking that it blows away every other suspense story I have ever read.  Lowen is a struggling writer when she gets an offer too good to pass up. Jeremy, the husband of successful author Verity Crawford, hires Lowen to complete Verity 's series when his injured wife is unable to do so. Once Lowen arrives at their home to start compiling notes and do research, she discovers an unfinished manuscript that looks to be Verity 's autobiography. What is written in those pages will horrify and haunt anyone who reads it.  So many books advertise as suspenseful thrillers, but hardly any of them cause my heart to blip even a little. (I know, I am a stone cold reader.) But this book! There is such a deliciously creepy atmosphere that permeates throughout and it got me good. I will admit to heart palpitations, cold clammy hands, and being startled at the smallest noises. And as the story progresses and we find out more and more, the tension ratchets up to almost unbearable levels.  There was never any hope for me. I was hooked from the very first page. There is a creativity to this story that makes it hard to look away. I have never read anything like this, not even close. As a result, every page was a surprise and I just wanted to keep going. And as the truth gets darker and more tortuous, I had no choice but to hold on for the ride of my life.  This book employs one of my favorite formats, a story within a story. I have loved pretty much every book I have come across that uses this format, and it works especially well here. The interspersing of the inner manuscript with the outer story allows us to find out what 's going on at the same time that Lowen is figuring things out.  I cannot believe this is Colleen Hoover 's first thriller. Reading this feels like watching a master at their craft, setting the bar higher than I ever thought possible. This story is so astonishing and unsettling and completely original. It will stay with me for a long time.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  /     ~~~~~~~~~~~~        9 book reviews: I have pulled up this review and tried to make the words come for a couple of days now, but every time I try to write the words all that comes to mind is WTF Colleen?! Obviously we were warned going in that this one would but much different than her other novels, but she did not tell us that it would be so compulsive and I would not be able to live my life while reading it. How dare she?? But seriously, this book was so delicious in a seriously twisted way, and I feel slightly guilty admitting that I loved Verity so much due to its dark and disturbing nature.    There 's not really much you can say about the plot here, other than you really should just go into it blind. Obviously there are numerous content warnings, , but it you are open to picking up this book with as little knowledge of the story as possible it will be in your best interest.    The characters here are deviously flawed, every last one of them, and I this. I am a sucker for storylines that feature the writing of a book inside the plot, and this was no exception. The varying between Low 's present tense POV and the chapters featuring Verity 's autobiography built the most exquisite tension, and by the end of the novel we are flipping pages as quickly as Low is, trying to decipher where this is going and what 's going to happen. Also, that epilogue. That is all I will say, other than I am respectful and grateful to CoHo for leaving this book without the neat wrapping and shiny bow. There are pieces of the story that are essentially left up to the reader to determine their thoughts on, and while a bloody and gruesome story, this will make a fabulous book club novel with copious discussion points. Highly recommended if you can stomach the content, but beware reader-once you pick it up, you certainly wo not want to set it down until you turn the final page. 10 book reviews: Have you ever finished a book and thought  WTF did I just read? Verity is one of those books that will do that to you. Word to the wise for CoHo fans: this is not your typical book from Colleen Hoover. It s amazingly written and it s a completely captivating read, but it s so different from anything she s ever put out before.  Some families are lucky enough to never experience a single tragedy. But then there are those families that seem to have tragedies waiting on the back burner. What can go wrong, goes wrong. And then gets worse.   is a complex story about an author who is ghost writing a series for Verity Crawford, an author who is injured in a way she can t write right now- maybe ever. Her husband, Jeremy, commissions Lowen to do this work. Lowen goes to the Crawford s house to do some research but that house and that family is more than she ever expected. While searching through old paperwork pertaining to the series Verity has written, she finds a manuscript of a truly messed up autobiography that changes her life and the life of the Crawford family forever.  The word I would use to describe this book is . I was seriously disturbed the whole time I read. It wasn t too spooky for me, but it was thrilling and horrifying at times. The writing was out of this world and the story messed with my mind. I m not sure if I loved it, hated it, liked the characters or hated them. It s a story that s not always likable, but dang it was good. It was enthralling and made me think. That ending messed with my mind so bad, I don t even know how to feel.  If you re a fan of psychological thrillers with romance thrown in and don t mind a book that s disturbing and thrilling because it s also brilliant, check out . I m glad I went outside the box with this one and read it!! 11 book reviews: ** UNPOPULAR OPINION  This is the second novel that I have read by the author.  I am not really familiar with her writing or style, but I was seeing many 4-5 star ratings on this book and it was a \"thriller\" so that was enough to push me to give it a try.  There are many, many high reviews for the book so I am not here to dissuade anyone from reading it. It just was not a good fit for me. I read hundreds of thriller/mysteries and love the genre.  I have read darker novels and enjoyed them, but this one gave me an uncomfortable feeling that it is hard to express. Was it because it involved the characters children? Maybe. Was it the graphic sex scenes? May have contributed  Was it the improbable plot? I do not usually have an issue with this if I am entertained. I was not. I ca not explain more without giving spoilers.  Again, this novel did not work for me. If you decide to read it, you may enjoy it like so many others. Just my opinion. I wish I could unread it. 12 book reviews: oh my fucking god. i finished this book at 4am thinking  what the fuck did this author do to me?!?   this shit was brilliant. idek how to comprehend this. like was everyone a victim or a villain?!? am i team manuscripts or letters?!? i don t fucking know. tbh only Crew can set us free, he knows the truth.  i don t get disturbed easily but this shook me to the core. i could feel it in my bones. i don t even know how to function and move on with my life. i m a changed woman.  you ll be catching me blankly staring at walls lost in thought over this book 13 book reviews: Brilliant author. Brillianty written. Brilliant idea.  Except...  I did not like it. I did not like the heroine. Could not relate to her. I did not the hero. I did not like the story. Implausible and kind of revolting.  I normally like fucked up, unpredictable stories. The darker and more twisted the better. This one did not resonate with me. Sorry. And watch out for triggers. 14 book reviews: Um no. This ain t it chief. Also that ending?? NO.  I feel like the high ratings and amazing reviews for this book are mostly people who already love CoHo 's books and this is their,  wouldip of the toe' moment, for them in the 'thriller' genre lol. 15 book reviews: Help me. 16 book reviews: *Laughs hysterically* What?!  Three hours later and I m still laughing and head-shaking at the mindfuck that was this story.... 17 book reviews: this is not a romance or a thriller, this is a lifetime movie script 18 book reviews: what fucking bullshit!! 19 book reviews: excuse me what 20 book reviews: some people desperately need jesus and colleen hoover is one of them 21 book reviews: how the same woman who wrote Atlas Corrigan could turn around and write something this fucked up i will never know 22 book reviews: the unseasoned, Walmart brand version of Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier 23 book reviews: my uncle in law made me read this book   MARK I READ IT ARE YOU HAPPY NOW  a r e y o u h a p p y 24 book reviews:   /5  This was... stupid?  I don t even know how to talk about this. I don t think this is actual mystery thriller, it is just a romance novel with a slightly different plot. Sadly, nothing about this book, particularly impressed me or intrigue me.  Personally, I do not think that this book is worth the time. 25 book reviews: It s currently 5:00 am, and I read Verity in one sitting. Dear god this book is FUCKED UP, and I love it. I am obsessed with twisted, disturbing, dark stuff that messes with my brain. It feels like a mix between The Silent Patient and Gone Girl. I physically could not put this book down. Definitely my favorite Colleen Hoover book I have read. This had everything I love: smut, sadness, and mind-bending plot twists. This book felt like a rollercoaster, and I implore you all to read it. Such a thrilling read. 26 book reviews: I LOVED THIS BOOK. Just posted my full booktalk on youtube (polandbananasbooks). I BLEW THROUGH IT IN TWO DAYS COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

    " What to Expect When You're Expecting": "book reviews: I seem to disagree with most of the reviews of this book.  This book got me through my pregnancy. Period.  I was not overwhelmed by the amount of information; instead I found it to be the only friendly, comforting book out there. While other books were telling me that if I would had a glass of wine before I knew I was pregnant, my child would have extra limbs and no face, reminded me how minute the chances actually were. When the my overly clinical other books told me to panic if I had not noticed the baby moving for three hours, told me that that actually happens to most women sometime in the third trimester, why I should be concerned, and again, how extremely low the probability was that something was actually wrong, but that I should still check in with my doctor just in case. Essentially this book kept me well informed so that I did not freak out about things (like loosing my mucus plug one morning at work) and knew what to look out for and when to call the doctor. The first book I got after my baby was born was , and I could not live without that either! I do not have my mother around to give me advice anymore, and these books feel like a mom sitting you down with a nice cup of tea and telling you exactly what they say: what to expect.  1 book reviews: I got about halfway through with this back in 1999 (when I was preggo with my 1st), before I chucked it. I am getting pissed off just thinking about it right now. There I was, a brand-new mother-to-be, and this ridiculous book had me convinced that every time I farted there was something wrong with me! And believe me, I farted quite a bit. Trust me, if you want to be a nervous wreck, run out and buy this book. Otherwise, relax. Babies are hearty little suckers. Just because you take Tylenol for headaches, drink a cup of coffee, or opt to eat the entire chocolate cake instead of veggies, does mean that your kid will be born with hideous birth defects. Here 's my advice, after having four healthy kids: . Ta-da!  2 book reviews: DNF at approx. 50% (25% skimmed [ Ok! Maybe 35%])  This is some quality #PregLit, don t get me wrong but its comprehensiveness is its downfall as far as my  completing  it goes. It covers just about everything you could ever imagine happening during pregnancy, from almost every possible perspective, though distinctly lacking in advice for any sort of Arnold Schwarzenegger -  Junior  type scenario. This is exceptional in its inclusiveness but I don t think it s possible for a human being, certainly not this humble Homo Sapien, to read more than a dozen pages at a time without falling into a deep and peaceful slumber. I ll be reading this in reference only, from this point forward, and would recommend it as a good resource for others, though honestly, you can find any of this stuff online these days anyway!  3 book reviews: For obvious reasons, I am not going to rate this book. What I can say, however, is that while it kept me company, it also kept me well informed. I grant you, this kind of comprehensive infodump might not be for everyone. I can see that more neurotic and insecure person could feel overwhelmed and even anxious; for me, it was just OK. I like knowing things on the one hand, and on the other, the pregnancy was a wonderful broadening and deepening of our family life and not something akin to the revolution that necessitates reorganisation of a whole life.  ___  The good thing about Goodreads is the one does not have to make any grand statements. One look at the \"currently reading\" shelf is enough.  Apparently something 's cooking. A baby bun. And I thought it inconceivable.  First sonogram. Oh my, a pollywog on a balloon.  The Mothers know. So. It 's official.  Seedling took a shortcut to Heaven skipping the Earth altogether.  4 book reviews: If you have to read one book on pregnancy, do yourself a favor and pick a different one than What to Expect. If you have lots of time on your hands and want to read several books, go ahead and read this one too. The general tone of this book is alarmist and condescending. Unless, of course, you planned the conception perfectly (Why, you and your partner did not even take Tylenol while trying to get pregnant!), your diet during pregnancy is a model that the USDA would be proud of, you would not dream of medicating your cold, you exercise daily, your desire to experience unmedicated birth is overwhelming, and you beleive that anything other than wearing your baby 24/7 to promote attachment is akin to child abuse.  I am not quite sure how to explain how this book makes me feel other than this analogy - it felt like going to your doctor to ask for the morning-after-pill to only receive a lecture on the dangers of multiple sex partners from the old-school nurse. While sitting on a cold exam table in a paper gown. While nursing a hangover and trying not to throw up.  Anyway, I do give the book two stars because the section \"When to Call The Doctor\" is a pretty useful and easy to find reference when something freaky is happening and you have lost all common sense and are panicky and do not know what to do. (Similarly, the What To Expect The First Year book has useful references for when you do not know what to do with your out-of-sorts infant. I kinda feel bad slamming this book so hard when the First Year book was my bible whenever my son was sick.) Surely though, other books must have this handy reference too?  5 book reviews: How do I give this zero stars? This book should be called \"What to Freak Out About When You are Expecting\" and, unfortunately, goes hand-in-hand with TLC 's \"Baby Story\" for gross negligence in maternity \"infotainment.\" It addresses everything that could possibly \"go wrong\" or be of concern, emphasizing rare \"high risk\" complications that do NOT effect the VAST majority of women. Rather than explaining normal, healthy pregnancy in a positive and reassuring manner, it talks down to women and convinces them that every new sensation or pregnancy symptom they feel is cause for alarm or a sign that their body (or their baby) may be defective. To me, this is just one more way doctors make money off of unnecessary office visits and routine interventions. UGH.  6 book reviews: It is unfortunate that sometimes no one tells us we are bad at something, and then we bumble on through life thinking we are good at it. That 's what 's happened to Heidi Murkoff, who is a terrible writer laboring under the delusion that she is a good writer and comedic to boot. This book has somehow managed to attain status as some kind of pregnancy bible, but in reality it is an unbearable slog through every worst case scenario any expectant parents could ever hope to avoid. The author looks down on her thick-headed audience, constantly stooping to explain for us morons something that was already spelled out for children in the previous sentence. Worse, she breaks up the \"flow\" (hah!) of her writing with parenthetical comments ad fucking nauseam. \"If you are pregnant (and even if you are not), exercise is a good idea (but do not overdo it). Start slowly (no marathons the first week!) ...\" and then you want to stick a knitting needle in your eye. The whole goddam book is like that, with pointless \"jokey\" asides stuffing the pages until the book tries to commit suicide by bloat. Such a thing is possible, by the way. Somehow this incompetent writer has made a cottage industry of this; I hear \"What to Expect the First Year\" is far worse, if one can imagine such a painful fate.  Are you planning to have children? Are you and your spouse pregnant now? Find a doctor you trust in your neighborhood. Talk to your parents, siblings, and friends who have children, especially those who have had kids recently. Ask about Braxton-Hicks contractions so you do not wind up in the emergency room thinking you are having your baby at seven months when you first feel some contractions. Skim a pregnancy guide; you ca not learn everything, you wo not remember everything, and there 's no point learning about every single terrible thing that might go wrong one out of a million times. Throw this rotten piece of trash as far away from yourself as you possibly can. Good luck.   7 book reviews: This is probably not the worst pregnancy book in the universe, but it is the worst one I have ever read. Unfortunately it 's also the most popular, no doubt due to its admittedly catchy title and unavoidable ubiquity. I am sure that many, many women, like me, zipped off to the library and grabbed this first thing after their positive pregnancy test.  I had zero ambivalence about being pregnant, but I imagine that for other thinking women less sure they want a baby, this book could do a lot to make them decide that in fact they might not. A lot of people have complained about its alarmist tone and cataloguing of things that can go wrong, but I do not particularly remember that; what I hated was its insultingly cutesy-but-hideously-uncute, grating, idiotic style. The entire book is written in peppy, spunky awful-puns-that-are not-even-really-puns and moronic-jokes-that-are not-actually-jokes. These are not real examples, because I do not have the book, but seriously the whole thing is like, \"Being pregnant is a gas! And you will gas the whole time your little bun is in the oven... Speaking of buns, you may want to indulge your cravings for sticky buns, but be careful or buns will get fat and no one wants that! Teeheehee!\" I mean, obviously that is not a direct quotation, but in essence it really is not so far off. I hate this book because it makes pregnancy seem stupid, and seems to imply that being pregnant is going to make stupid. If this is something you are already kind of worried about, can be a highly distressing read. I found its tone so nauseating and awful that it made me slightly less excited about being pregnant for awhile. It really made the whole thing seem like a lame project for stupid, infantilized women, and something I did not want to be a part of at all despite really wanting a baby.  To be fair, I have a hard time with a lot of accepted pregnancy book conventions, beyond just this book. Use of the word \"baby\" with no article rankles me, and referring to a six-week-old embryo as a baby (or, infinitely worse, just as \"baby\") completely skeezes me out. A lot of this is due to a lifetime of programming and conviction about reproductive rights, but it 's also because I am aware that there are high rates of miscarriage in the first trimester. Of course it 's a personal choice when you decide to think of your fetus as having personhood, but it seems irresponsible to me the way all these books start personifying and burbling on about an adorable bundle of joy so early on in the process... But of course, that 's just me.  I am not made of stone and I was incredibly emotional and excited about being pregnant, but I found the discourse of these books really alienating, and this one was the worst. A lot of people seem to love it, but if you are like me you would do better off with something else. Honestly, I did not ever find a pregnancy book I loved (childbirth yes; pregnancy, no) and wound up getting most of my intel from the BabyCenter website, which is not perfect but is decent and has an infinitely more tolerable tone.  8 book reviews: Am I pregnant? No.  Am I bored enough to read this book during quarantine? Apparently, yes.  Am I now afraid of a baby 's leg getting lodged in my birth canal? Oh, you know it!  9 book reviews: Avoid this book at all costs!  It infantilizes pregnant women and tells them to just go along with whatever the doctor says they should do. I also remember it being very hetero-normative.  A much better book is The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth by Sheila Kitzinger.  The only thing is good for is starting a fire to keep the expectant mother warm.  10 book reviews: When I was pregnant with my first child, I picked up nearly every book on the bookstore shelves having to do with pregnancy and childbirth. I wanted comfort, a friend in the form of a book, a companion to hold my hand and let me know everything was going to be okay.  This book was not that friend.  Instead, everytime I read this book, I found myself getting more and more agitated. It exposed me to almost TOO much information, verging on the point of overload. You know how medical students become convinced they have every wacky and rare disease they learn about in med school? That 's how I felt when I read this book. After each chapter, I became convinced my child had Downs Syndrome, that I had placenta previa, that I was suffering from gestational diabetes, etc., etc.  Now that I have three children, I feel like I am in the position to make a recommendation -- get this book if you must, but do not read it cover to cover. Use it as a resource if one of the other books you read (I suggest \"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\" by Ann Douglas) leaves you wanting more information.  By the way, I did not follow the \"Best Odds Diet\" and my kids still turned out fine. :)  11 book reviews: It felt to me like this book is out to scare moms-to-be. Instead of celebrating how normal many of our pregnancy changes are, this book makes you question any weight gain (hello, we are growing babies here! They weigh alot!)and can often take a hectoring tone. I do not think ladies need that. Check out any of the other fine pregnancy and labor books out there by Sears, Gaskin, Kitzinger, Simkin, England and others. 12 book reviews: I was back and forth on rating this for a rating, but I would generally give it 3.5 stars. I rounded up due to agitation over a few of the hyper-negative reviews, to be quite honest. I do not feel that a book this valuable ought to be given a bad name because certain people did not get out of it whatever it was they were expecting. (Please excuse the pun.)  This is an extensive reference guidebook covering the stages of pre-conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and post-postpartum--not something I would recommend anyone read cover-to-cover. And coming from the standpoint of a less-than-squeamish Labor & Delivery nurse, I found the medical aspects to be accurate, well stated, and thoughtfully presented. Thankfully, it offers a bit more personality and compassion than a text book. (Sort of a Dear Abby meets Lippincott 's)  Is it the foremost authority on the subject of procreation and all of the variables therein? Not at all. But I do recommend it as a level-headed companion to satisfy one 's random curiosities/concerns--which internet searches can often give conflicting results on. (I am only speaking for the Revised & Expanded 2nd edition. I am sure there were a number of kinks worked out from earlier versions, and more modifications made on the two most recent editions.)  I did try to come up with a quick list of people who would be better off avoiding this up front, just to save time and griping later on.  Do not read this book if you are:  *Looking for a fun Chick-Lit read.  *Easily intimidated by a thorough collection of information on a deeply complex topic.  *Neurotic, or likely to become neurotic during pregnancy.  *Generally resentful of those 'crazies' who respect the idea of natural childbirth.  *Have difficulty taking responsibility for your own actions/reactions to knowledge.  *Would rather jam your fingers in your ears and hum than be medically informed.  13 book reviews: Preachy, harping, self-righteous. I hated this book. Every other page has some guilt-tripping admonishment not to eat white flour (\"Push the bread basket away at a restaurant if the bread is not whole wheat,\" it said once, and oh, count the calories in the butter you do spread on your whole wheat bread). And avoid white sugar like the plauge - in favor of \"juice-sweetened\" cookies or desserts, which the authors seem to think is the ticket to health in every occasion. News flash: sugar is sugar, whether it comes from fruit or sugar cane, and the human body physiologically ca not tell a difference. As a hypoglycemic, I will get just as nauseated if I eat grapes or a candy bar on an empty stomach.  Give me a break. I am as healthy as they come. I make my own whole wheat bread and yogurt and eat very little sugar, but to tell a hungry pregnant woman to \"push the bread basket away\" at a restaurant just because the bread is not whole-wheat? Even licensed nutritionists will tell you that the overall fiber count in a meal is what is important - not necessarily the fiber count in a particular food. And I do not need to hear about it every other page, ad infinitum. I started to think that if I heard the term \"juice-sweetened cookie\" one more time, I would throw the book out the window.  The rest of the book is spread thickly with admonishments not to gain too much weight, not to eat dessert except \"fresh fruit,\" and on and on and on. One \"question\" (which was probably self-written and planted in order for the author to do more harping) said, \"I have gained 13 pounds in my first trimester. What can I do now?\" The author 's harsh and judgmental answer, in a nutshell: \"It is TOO LATE. You have done what you have done, and it ca not be fixed now.\" And then they goes on to guilt-trip the supposed \"questioner\" and rant about \"healthy\" weight gain (according to their own limited views of \"healthy\" eating).  What a ridiculous answer! Is the author a doctor who knows this particular patient and is licensed to dispense medical advice to her and all other readers? Of course not! A suitable and appropriate answer would have been something along these lines: \"IT DEPENDS. Each woman is different, and your ob/gyn can tell you more about what 's healthy for you and what 's out of range.\" Guess what? I HAVE gained 13 pounds, and I am not even done with my first trimester! AND my doc says I am totally healthy! Before my pregnancy I was very underweight, barely 95 or 96 pounds, and my metabolism has always been through the roof. Getting myself up to 109 pounds - on, yes, a very healthy diet - was a wonderful victory, and I am not sorry in the least.  Oh, and the \"raid your husband 's closet\" clothing advice did not help much, either. Maybe that 's because the author thinks we are all whales who eat too much and ca not fit into anything else?  If you want a book that talks about real issues and gets off a soapbox for five minutes, this is not the one.  By the way, here 's a shocking revelation - I occasionally eat dessert and white bread, and I do not count the calories in my butter. Shh!!  14 book reviews: This book has a mixed reaction from moms--some feel that it can be too strict at times in terms of diet and exercise. However, I really enjoyed the book and took the pregnancy diet tips as tips, not ultimatiums. As a first-time mom, this book had helpful question and answer sections for each month that encouraged me.  What to Expect answers questions such as what to watch out for when you are pregnant, tips for buying a layette set and how to help you and your husband bond with the newborn. In a way, it 's like your mom, doctor and pastor are answering all of your questions without the phone call!  Great read. I highly recommend What to Expect the First Year after this. It starts right at month one of the newborn, which is the most nerve-wracking month of their life! I probably used this book every day for the first 2 months!  15 book reviews: I had three reactions reading this book:  1) Oh, ok, so that 's normal. 2) Thank god I do not have THAT. 3) randomly crying mid-chapter each time it said 'your baby'.  Very informative and recommended for anyone like me who needs to know absolutely everything and consider every single scenario.  16 book reviews: How can you complain about too much information? This book was great, practical and reassuring. The index had most every topic I could think of. However, the version I read needed an update on epidurals since it did not recognize that many women today have them during childbirth. It does have diet guidelines that are healthy goals. I personally did not follow them but they might be useful for someone who thinks that it is ok to gorge on whatever you want just because of being pregnant.  17 book reviews: Talk about your guilt trips! I know this is a popular gift to give someone who is expecting a baby and it does contain some useful info. but it does seem like the Martha Stewart approach to child rearing. Inpractical for most of us mortals. 18 book reviews: It may be appropriate to read these books as an introduction to pregnancy and birth, but you must not stop here!  The books in this series may be helpful if you know absolutely nothing about how pregnancy and birth are managed in mainstream America, or if you hate asking questions from your doctor. But in my opinion, there are many, many books out there that educate and prepare women to understand, deal with and manage their pregnancies and births , not as quiet, non-questioning, passive patients.  19 book reviews: Once I got past the terrible, frumpalicious Mom in loafers cover art, I found this book both helpful and horrifying in almost equal measures. Although the ending was totally predictable(9 months then baby? Yawn.), I was still shocked by it. They really had me hoping up til the very end that there was some other way for that baby to get out. 20 book reviews: Hajmo re i da je neki op ti utisak prose an...ne bih preterano ulazila u detalje.  Uzev i u obzir  injenicu da sam poslednju pro itala krajem maja i da mi dete ima dva meseca, a ja upravo zavr ila knjigu o trudno i, jasno je ko dan kakva je  itala ka kriza nastupila. No dobro, bar  u uskoro krenuti sa slikovnicama. ;) 21 book reviews: Well, some of my goodreads friends may think (and I would not blame them) that pregnancy has made me completely illiterate, so it 's about time I caught up with my updates. It 's true, between doing baby registry research, diaper research, birth research, and driving to work for the past three months instead of taking public transit, I have had much less time to read than before, but I suppose that 's just preparation for the busy time to come. In any case, on to the reviews...  Starting with this one, which my friend Caitlin refers to as \"the one everyone loves to hate.\" I could not agree more. This book is a fear-mongering nightmare - please do yourself a favor and skip it. Every chapter is made up of hysterical pregnant women 's questions about all of the stuff that can go wrong. And the advice is all about how to be the absolutely perfect mother, so that you do not f-up your baby by taking one wrong step. The best example of this is their \"best bite for your baby\" approach to eating - before every bite you take, you are supposed to ask yourself whether it 's the most nutritious thing you could be eating. Well, no, the riotous amounts of milkshakes and Kraft Singles that I have consumed in the past few months were probably not the most nutritious things I could have put in my body, but, man, were they satisfying! And a happy mommy = a happy baby, so the authors can shove it. If anyone wants to give you this book, just refuse politely. You will be happier as a result, and far less paranoid.  22 book reviews: This book should be burned. And banned. And quite possibly run over by a car beforehand. Nothing makes an expectant mother more terrified than the horror stories in this book, and the idiot who decided an appropriate \"breakfast\" for a pregnant woman is half a bagel with one tablespoon of non-fat cream cheese should be coated in butter and broiled. 23 book reviews: Too alarmist for my taste. According to this book pretty much everything you do while pregnant will hurt your baby. Not for me! 24 book reviews: My pregnancy bible! 25 book reviews: 4.5/5  This one is often thought of as the classic \"pregnancy bible\" and I can certainly see why. I was gifted a copy of this book when I was about a month and a half pregnant and started reading it immediately. I read it through my whole pregnancy from start to finish, following along with each week. I always looked forward to hitting a new week and reading up about it in the book throughout my pregnancy. I really enjoyed it and felt that it covered pretty much everything you could ever want to know about pregnancy.  Not only did I read it from cover to cover (which probably is not recommended... information overload!), I often found myself using the index in the back to also look up and read up on certain topics or questions I had at any given time as well.  I liked the layout of the book, with each week of pregnancy being covered, and the extensive information. I often found it comforting and found myself referencing it in some of my scarier moments early on in my pregnancy.  While it is not perfect, and some of the information can be a bit overwhelming, in your face, scary, or seemingly judgmental, all in all I thought it was a very handy and thorough guide and one that I would recommend highly.  26 book reviews: Eskiden hamilelikle ilgili telefon uygulamas  yokken san r m bu kitap alan nda bir efsane olabilirdi   hala daha  yle ama uygulamalardan hafta hafta takip edip buradan ay ay takip ediyorsunuz en b y k fark  bu.

Mutlaka tavsiye ederim tek sorun bilgilerin biraz eskiden gelmesi ama Do um da bildi imiz en eski olaylardan biri de il mi zaten   27 book reviews: I am not expecting but I like to know stuff in advance and make lists and know what to expect, the good and the bad and it makes me feel a bit more comfortable with the whole concept. I like the Q/A format and the month-by-month organization, which makes it a bit easier to navigate! 28 book reviews: NOT PREGNANT!! I have just been following along with my sister-in-law 's pregnancy, which is almost over! And I technically did not read every chapter, just the month by month section, labor/delivery, and postpartum. It was really interesting to learn more, but I would have liked to learn even more about what 's going on the baby. There were maybe four paragraphs in each chapter about baby 's progress and the rest about possible symptoms (which were still really interesting). Overall I would have liked a more straightforward science-y take on things, where instead there 's just a lot of puns and plays on words. I am a fan of a good pun, but seriously every paragraph had a play on words, and that is not an exaggeration. It kept the book more conversational, but after a while it was pretty eye-roll worthy. That said, the book is packed with good information.  29 book reviews: I found this book to be a good place to start. I greatly enjoy the research and information-gathering process, so this book presented a jumping-off point for me in my quest to arm myself with knowledge about my pregnancy and birthing options.  Overall, I found \"Expecting\" to be: - user friendly - easy to read - clearly laid out - thorough - fairly moderate & inclusive in its opinions & advice  Was this book my only resource during pregnancy? Absolutely not! Was it my favorite resource? Nope! Was it worth reading? Yes! I happily skimmed through some sections, skipped others altogether, and allowed some information to push me towards further, more specific research from other sources.  "
